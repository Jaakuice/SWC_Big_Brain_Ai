**Interviewer:**
(0:00:00) UK-based web and marketing firm, the Smarter Web Company, is doubling down on the cryptocurrency, expanding its Bitcoin treasury strategy with an additional $24 million investment as part of its 10-year plan. According to data provider Bitcoin Treasuries, corporate treasuries have surpassed ETFs in Bitcoin buying for a third consecutive quarter, growing their Bitcoin balance by around 18%, while ETFs showed an 8% increase in the same period.

**Interviewer:**
(0:00:27) Andrew Webley is the CEO of the Smarter Web Company and joins us now. Andrew, nice to see you. You call yourself the Smarter Web Company and you've got your name in the title. It works very well for you, doesn't it? Most web companies are about the web. Anyway, look, just tell me, I'm going to take a step back and I'm going to do this very slowly. We've got time. What does your company actually do?

**Andy (@asjwebley):**
(0:00:45) So we're a web design business. We've been established for 15 years, profitable for 15 years. And we've got three parts to our business. So we've got the core operating business, which is web design, over 250 clients, 30% reoccurring revenue. We've got the long-term acquisition strategy,

**Andy (@asjwebley):**
(0:01:02) And then finally, we've got our approach to treasury management. So doing what I believe that I've done myself personally for almost 10 years, we don't believe in the value of the pound, the dollar, the euro. So we keep our assets in the best asset in the world, which is, in my opinion, Bitcoin.

**Interviewer:**
(0:01:17) Okay, so I'm learning on my feet here as well about Bitcoin Treasury. In fact, one of the smartest guys I know is watching this interview because he has flagged up the importance of Bitcoin Treasury to me, actually in recent days. And I'm learning new acronyms as well, including MNVA, I think it is as well, which is the multiple of the net asset value of a company as well.

**Interviewer:**
(0:01:43) I'm going to say something and you can either agree or disagree. Your company has become a Bitcoin play. The valuation of your company, the valuation of Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy company and others doing the same strategy, you've become purely valued on your Bitcoin assets. You're going to disagree with me, I'm sure, but go ahead.

**Andy (@asjwebley):**
(0:02:01) I think what you have to appreciate is that every business, whether you're talking about a property business or whether you're talking about a supermarket or whether you're talking about a bank, every business is valued effectively on its balance sheet and its future potential.

**Interviewer:**
But you design webs?

**Andy (@asjwebley):**
Well, we do three things. So we've got the web design business, which is profitable.

**Interviewer:**
I don't think you can say that. Do you think you're valued on your acquisition strategy and your web design business strategy? I don't.

**Andy (@asjwebley):**
(0:02:29) I think we're valued on our potential. So on our potential based on everything.

**Interviewer:**
I hope you take this robust conversation in good spirits because I'm learning. So I'm kind of just chucking questions out there. You're not. You're valued on your Bitcoin strategy, aren't you? On your MNAV. Yes, we call it MNAV, which is a multiple of your underlying assets.

**Andy (@asjwebley):**
(0:02:48) So if you look at the sector globally, and by sector I mean companies that have adopted Bitcoin on their balance sheet, you've got companies like Strategy, MetaPlanet, the Blockchain Group in France, which are a lot more...

**Interviewer:**
I've seen the numbers, it's extraordinary.

**Andy (@asjwebley):**
Yeah, yeah, and they're fantastic companies, and this isn't like a...

**Interviewer:**
But those fantastic companies, I'm badgering, sorry, those fantastic companies are not valued on the fantastic work they do on their acquisition strategy and their web design, in your case.

**Andy (@asjwebley):**
(0:03:16) Yeah, well, what you have to understand is that Bitcoin, we believe, is the very best asset in the world. That's why we put it on there. But capital markets in the UK haven't been great in recent terms. So if we can use the power of Bitcoin to then unlock the traditional side of our business, which probably wouldn't have the capital to grow without the Treasury strategy, it's a great thing.

**Interviewer:**
Andrew, I'm not doubting what a great businessman you are. I'm not doubting how much it's taken you up in terms of valuations. I just want to be very clear that a lot of people

**Interviewer:**
(0:03:46) are investing in companies that say they do X, Y, and Z, when actually we all know that it's only Z that you're being valued on.

**Andy (@asjwebley):**
Well, that's the same as every business. If I look at every investment that I've made personally, I invest in elements. I don't buy Vodafone and think, oh, they've got X amount of cash on their books. I buy them because they're a telecoms company. I don't buy and sell BP because they're holding dollars or, I don't know, peso or what have you. I buy them because they get oil out the ground, or they don't. They do it well or not.

**Interviewer:**
(0:04:16) Your company, with respect, the investors and Michael Saylor's company and some of the names you mentioned there, we're now buying them or selling them on the basis of their treasury function. That is a big sea change for a lot of our viewers.

**Andy (@asjwebley):**
(0:04:31) Some people may do that, and I definitely accept that. And the reason why they do that, and they pay that multiple, the MNAV, is because they believe that that business can execute that treasury strategy better than, say, an ETF, for example. So you will get investors that do that.

**Andy (@asjwebley):**
(0:04:46) You know, I hold six different Bitcoin treasury companies globally, that is. I only hold one in the UK, which is our company. And I hold them because I believe in Bitcoin and I also believe in the management and their ability to grow that Bitcoin on their balance sheet to then do whatever they do with it, which may be,

**Andy (@asjwebley):**
(0:05:04) buy more Bitcoin, or in our case, maybe buy more Bitcoin, do the acquisition strategy and grow the core business. So if you look at the sector of Bitcoin, public companies with Bitcoin on the balance sheet, of which there's probably approximately 150 today, public companies, you know, some of them are people like Tesla, who have got Bitcoin on their balance sheet.

**Interviewer:**
(0:05:24) Yeah, and Tesla, which had 61% decline in its Danish sales a day ago, that's gone X growth on its global sales in the second quarter and is trading 140 times forward.

**Andy (@asjwebley):**
Yeah, and going back to your point about why people buy things, if you look at Tesla, for example, I would argue that people buy it more for Elon Musk's

**Andy (@asjwebley):**
(0:05:43) brilliance and and his maybe his ai i would argue that's what they think

**Interviewer:**
yes robotics automation

**Andy (@asjwebley):**
so people buy different things on different for different reasons and you know clearly some people buy us because of our approach to treasury management

**Interviewer:**
now i'm getting better now you see i know because i know say if you've got a higher m nav then you know the higher it is the more they're valuing the multiple of your future growth and future profitability

**Andy (@asjwebley):**
yeah

**Interviewer:**
(0:06:08) Why don't I just go and buy Bitcoin rather than buying your company? And I get Bitcoin one for one. I don't have to have some valuation based on what it might be worth at some time in the future.

**Andy (@asjwebley):**
Well, that's a great question. I'm glad that you've asked that.

**Interviewer:**
Oh, thank you. I've asked one finally.

**Andy (@asjwebley):**
Yeah, because if you look at any company that's doing

**Andy (@asjwebley):**
(0:06:28) putting Bitcoin on the balance sheet, then there's another thing that you may not have found yet, which is called days to cover. So if you look at our company, we're the fastest growing public company in the world with Bitcoin on their balance sheet. And everything else being equal, we actually do not trade at a premium within 35 days, if you believe the maths. There's certain assumptions to that. So you grow into your valuation, which is the same, to be fair.

**Interviewer:**
Of any company, yeah, for sure. No, I get that.

**Interviewer:**
(0:06:58) Are you leveraged on your balance sheet?

**Andy (@asjwebley):**
No, we have no debt.

**Interviewer:**
And that's a key point, isn't it?

**Andy (@asjwebley):**
Yeah, we have no debt. We only buy Bitcoin, pure Bitcoin. We don't buy, you know, derivatives or anything like that. And, you know, we have taken a very cautious approach to how we're trying to grow our overall business. We've got over 100 million pounds of capital in our business.

**Interviewer:**
(0:07:20) Okay, so we're now learning something. We've gone through MNAV, we've gone from Days to Cover, but there are a lot of companies, I would imagine, who are carrying out a similar strategy in their treasury and are leveraged to the hilt on this one. I've seen it in the underlying market as well. A, is that the case, and B, does that worry you?

**Andy (@asjwebley):**
(0:07:36) Yes, it is the case. Yes, it worries me. And I would expand on your question to say that there's a lot of companies that are saying that they're doing this strategy and they don't even own any Bitcoin. So I think it's an absolute minefield.

**Interviewer:**
What? Hang on.

**Andy (@asjwebley):**
Yeah.

**Interviewer:**
They are saying they're doing a Bitcoin treasury strategy. They're getting a higher MNAV. They have lower days to cover and they're not actually even doing it?

**Andy (@asjwebley):**
Yeah.

**Andy (@asjwebley):**
(0:08:06) So in the UK right now, there's probably approximately 25 that sprung up since we IPO'd our company.

**Interviewer:**
Yeah.

**Andy (@asjwebley):**
And off the top of my head, less than five of those, including us, have got any Bitcoin.

**Interviewer:**
And we've got considerable SPACs all over again.

**Andy (@asjwebley):**
(0:08:14) Well, this is the worry, and this is why, from a regulation point of view, what we've done is we've tried to lead. We've tried to lead by example. So what we've done is we've done more than we've been asked to do, and we're trying to drive these standards, because for somebody like me that cares about Bitcoin and very much cares about the business that he's built over the last 15 years, I want the investors to be put first and to really try and push that side of things forward, which is different, I would suggest, to the way a lot of companies approach these things, because in my opinion,

**Andy (@asjwebley):**
(0:08:44) More regulation, better regulation, more transparency, which is one of the reasons why people like us, is a very, very positive thing.

**Interviewer:**
Absolutely fascinating as well on this. I'm a great believer in knowing your own ignorance is a path to true knowledge. And I'm a great example of this one. So in that vein, I haven't got a clue where Bitcoin's going. Do you think you know?

**Andy (@asjwebley):**
(0:09:06) Well, I believe that Bitcoin is going up considerably over the long term, but I'm not really that interested in the short term price, you know, whether it goes up a bit, down a bit. What I do is I zoom out and I look at the last 10 years approximately since I've been invested and I can see that it's been the best performing asset in the world by far over that time period. And that's what I believe for the future. I'm not going to say whether I think you'll get to $3 million, $5 million, $10 million, $50 million per coin. I believe it's heading up.

**Andy (@asjwebley):**
(0:09:33) over the long term. And I believe it will be a scarcer and a scarcer thing because it's actually built into the maths of how Bitcoin works.

**Interviewer:**
Having told the director, I'm going to wrap this about three questions ago. I'm going to carry on for now. Do you believe there is a level at which, and you've already absolutely very importantly just showed out the charlaters and frauds in this, fraudsters who are saying they're doing something and they're not. And why are the regulations not catching up with them? I don't know. But is there a level at which MNAV gets

**Interviewer:**
(0:10:00) MNAV gets ridiculous and actually you will cash in at some stage or actually you will worry about MNAV being too high

**Andy (@asjwebley):**
no so the the only concern there is that you know as the MNAV gets higher and you know the the MNAV is let's say it's getting out of control so what that means is you've got a very good premium in your share price because people believe you

**Interviewer:**
put on an ARB Andrew when you put on an ARB buy Bitcoin sell sell your company almost all kind of that's a great ARB isn't it

**Andy (@asjwebley):**
(0:10:28) What you would do is you would sell more equity. So you would benefit the shareholders, the owners of the business, as we have done, by raising more equity at better and better terms, thus allowing you to have more Bitcoin per share if you're only focusing on the Treasury side of what we do.

**Interviewer:**
Which brings us back to where we started about what they're buying.

**Interviewer:**
(0:10:46) I love the conversation. Thank you very much indeed. Hopefully I've learned a tiny little bit. I'm sure I have. And I definitely think our viewers have. So thank you so much for going through it and being so patient with me. Andrew Webley, who's CEO of the SmarterWeb company. See what he did there?
