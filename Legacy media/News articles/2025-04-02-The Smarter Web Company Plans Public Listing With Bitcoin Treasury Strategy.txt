Smarter Web Company prepares to go public with a Bitcoin treasury strategy, marking a shift in how growth-focused firms manage capital and preserve value.

The Smarter Web Company, founded in 2009 by Andrew Webley, has announced plans to go public on the AQUIS Stock Exchange in April 2025 through a reverse takeover of a business originally incorporated in 1907. But what makes this listing significant isn’t the transaction mechanics—it’s the capital strategy behind it.

Since 2023, The Smarter Web Company has accepted Bitcoin as payment. Now, as it prepares to list its shares, it’s laying the groundwork for a formal Digital Assets Treasury Policy—one that includes holding Bitcoin alongside cash.

The company’s leadership views Bitcoin not as a speculative play, but as a deliberate reserve asset. It is, in their words, a hedge against inflation and a forward-looking mechanism to preserve value over time.

As the company pursues both organic growth and strategic acquisitions post-listing, Bitcoin will serve as part of its long-term capital preservation toolkit—a move echoing the playbooks of early movers like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and Metaplanet.

The company’s plans have already attracted aligned investors. In January 2025, The Smarter Web Company closed a pre-IPO funding round of more than £1 million, backed by UTXO Management—a Bitcoin-focused investment manager and operator of the hedge fund 210k Capital, LP.

An additional raise of over £2 million is underway as part of the company’s listing strategy.

This isn’t passive capital. UTXO and other mission-aligned backers are building a new class of public company—firms with long-term Bitcoin alignment and treasury discipline integrated from the start.

Once listed, The Smarter Web Company will become one of the first UK-listed businesses to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy from day one. That alone makes it notable. Most publicly traded companies that hold Bitcoin did so as a pivot or response to broader macro shifts. Smarter Web is taking a different route—baking Bitcoin into its financial DNA before it ever hits the public markets.

This signals something much larger than a single company’s conviction. It shows that the Bitcoin treasury model is becoming accessible, practical, and strategically relevant for companies beyond the usual early adopters. You don’t need a multibillion-dollar balance sheet to begin integrating Bitcoin into your corporate strategy—you need alignment, vision, and a framework that prioritizes capital preservation and long-term value.

For mid-sized and growth-stage businesses, Bitcoin increasingly fits the bill. The same financial pressures that push large enterprises toward more efficient capital strategies—persistent inflation, fiat depreciation, and the opportunity cost of holding idle cash—apply equally, if not more urgently, to smaller firms operating in competitive environments.

Whether it’s recurring revenue or future M&A, capital efficiency is a strategic imperative. Bitcoin offers a unique tool in that mix—one that traditional treasury assets cannot replicate. It’s portable, non-sovereign, resistant to dilution, and optimized for long time horizons. For companies seeking to store the value they’ve earned today and deploy it tomorrow without losing purchasing power, Bitcoin represents a new operating standard—not just a hedge.

As public company disclosures begin post-listing, The Smarter Web Company has committed to including material treasury updates alongside core business performance—a level of transparency that will give investors and analysts insight into how digital assets play a role in managing corporate capital.

Bitcoin- native capital formation, treasury strategy, and operational adoption are no longer isolated to headline-making firms like Strategy and Metaplanet. The playbook is expanding, and companies like The Smarter Web Company are positioning themselves to lead a new chapter—where treasury innovation is a signal, not a stunt.

For corporate leaders, the lesson is clear: the barriers to action are falling. The only question that remains is timing.
