UK retail investors can join The Smarter Web Company IPO as it integrates a bitcoin treasury strategy into its public market debut.

Set to list on the Aquis Stock Exchange Growth Market on April 25, 2025, the company is raising up to £2 million through a combination of institutional and retail subscriptions. The retail offer is available via the Winterflood Retail Access Platform (WRAP) and will remain open until 5:00 p.m. on April 17, 2025. Applications can be made using funds held within ISAs and SIPPs, with a minimum subscription of £500.

Retail allocations at the IPO stage remain uncommon in UK markets, making this a noteworthy opportunity for individual investors to take part in the early phase of a public company that blends traditional growth strategy and forward-thinking capital management with a Bitcoin treasury strategy in place.

Importantly, this IPO is being carried out through Uranium Energy Exploration PLC, an existing unlisted PLC that, upon Admission, will acquire The Smarter Web Company Limited and be renamed The Smarter Web Company PLC. The listing serves as the formal vehicle for that transition—turning the shell into a fully operating digital services company with a Bitcoin treasury strategy.

Founded in 2009, The Smarter Web Company delivers web design and digital marketing services to businesses of all sizes. With a scalable product offering and proven revenue model, it’s well-positioned to grow through both organic expansion and targeted acquisitions.

Now, as it prepares to go public, the company is implementing a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy that includes allocating a portion of reserves to Bitcoin. This isn’t a pivot or transformation—it’s a forward-thinking enhancement to the balance sheet.

Rather than waiting for macro certainty or institutional pressure, The Smarter Web Company is proactively aligning its treasury with sound money principles from day one on the public markets.

The Smarter Web Company isn’t adopting Bitcoin to make headlines—it’s integrating it as a natural extension of how it operates.

The company generates recurring revenue, runs with a lean structure, and has a clear acquisition strategy to accelerate growth. It doesn’t need to raise billions or overhaul its business model to justify holding Bitcoin. Instead, it’s incorporating a Bitcoin treasury strategy as part of a disciplined, long-term capital plan.

This is where Bitcoin aligns with business fundamentals. It’s designed to store value over long horizons, immune to monetary debasement and increasingly liquid across global markets. For companies like The Smarter Web Company, that means protecting retained earnings without the drag of idle cash or the exposure of speculative assets.

But it’s not just about capital protection—it’s also about capital attraction. Holding Bitcoin on the balance sheet signals conviction, discipline, and future-facing leadership. It makes the company more attractive to a new class of mission-aligned investors, many of whom supported its pre-IPO round and continue to back Bitcoin-native businesses.
