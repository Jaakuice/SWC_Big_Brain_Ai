London Stock Exchange today welcomes The Smarter Web Company PLC to the market following its successful admission to trading.

Building better websites. Powered by digital capital.

The Smarter Web Company is a UK-based web design agency, founded in 2009 by Andrew Webley, specialising in creating bespoke, mobile-friendly websites for small and medium-sized businesses.

In 2025, the company began its Bitcoin treasury strategy, building a balance sheet of digital capital in the form of Bitcoin.

With an IPO in April 2025 on Aquis, The Smarter Web Company was the UK's best performing UK equity in 2025 and today has uplisted to The London Stock Exchange.

Today, The Smarter Web Company is the largest UK public company holding Bitcoin and the 29th largest public company holding Bitcoin globally.

The business has a well respected management team with a lean operating structure, with an experienced board of directors ensuring high levels of corporate governance.

The company aspires to continue building its balance sheet to eventually join the FTSE 250 and then the FTSE 100.

Andrew Webley, Chief Executive Officer of The Smarter Web Company PLC, commented:

"Taking a UK-born business from start-up to a public company is an achievement of which I am extremely proud. Moving to the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange marks the next significant milestone in that journey. I am committed to building a British success story that contributes to the UK economy, showcases the strength of the UK's entrepreneurial spirit in the technology sector, and demonstrates how Bitcoin can be used as digital capital."
