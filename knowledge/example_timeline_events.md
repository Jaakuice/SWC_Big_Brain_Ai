## Selection Guidance

### By Period
- **Pre-IPO (March-April 2025):** Limited data, focus on admission documents and early announcements
- **IPO Period (April-May 2025):** IPO documents, early strategy, initial listings
- **Growth Period (June-July 2025):** Heavy content across all sources, major milestones
- **Recent Period (November 2025 - January 2026):** LSE uplisting, current strategy, latest updates

### By Event Type
- **Regulatory:** Filter RNS by date and event type keyword
- **CEO Commentary:** Filter YouTube/Tweets by date
- **Quantitative:** Filter CSV by date range around event

## Cross-Reference Strategy
1. Identify event date from any source
2. Retrieve RNS for official announcement
3. Retrieve YouTube/Tweets for CEO commentary
4. Retrieve CSV for quantitative impact (share price, mNAV changes)
