# Bitcoin Purchase Timeline

## Purpose
Quick reference for all Bitcoin purchases announced by SWC, with dates, amounts, and sources.

## Data Sources
- **Quantitative:** `Smarter Web Data.csv` (BTC Balance, Bitcoin Buy, New BTC columns)
- **Official:** RNS PDFs with "Bitcoin" or "purchase" in filename/content
- **Commentary:** YouTube mNAV update videos and CEO interviews

## Selection Guidance
- For current BTC balance: Use CSV, filter for latest date
- For purchase announcements: Filter RNS by "Bitcoin" keyword and date
- For CEO commentary: Filter YouTube by date of purchase + "mNAV" or "Bitcoin"

## Cross-Reference Notes
- Match RNS announcement dates with CSV "Bitcoin Buy" column
- Cross-reference with YouTube videos for CEO rationale
- Validate amounts with CSV "New BTC" and "New BTC Cost" columns
