announcement, the company had approximately £4.1 million in treasury, consisting of 19.2
BTC and £2.6 million in cash. With the proceeds of the raise, the company will have
approximately £5.9 million to deploy into additional Bitcoin in the weeks ahead. As a
consequence, we expect the company to reach over 90 BTC within a matter of weeks.
DESCRIPTION With the shares trading at a solid premium to NAV, the raise is highly accretive to
shareholders in terms of Bitcoin yield. Assuming all its excess cash is deployed into BTC at

values the enlarged treasury of £7.4 million at £46.7 million. With the total share count

increase in potential sats per share from 33 to 55.

Treasury strategy made famous by Michael Saylor and Strategy Inc. (MSTR US). Backed by
its key original investor UTXO, part of BTC Inc., and allied to the largest Bitcoin-focused
media outfit, Bitcoin Magazine, SWC management is well positioned to use this successful
start as a springboard to accelerate its Bitcoin accumulation, as it seeks to tap different
pools of capital, whether in different product segments or geographies. SWC is fast
developing a reputation with investors across the globe as the ~UK flagship~ of the Bitcoin

Bitcoin Treasury Basics – A Reminder
Bitcoin is a unique digital asset that has demonstrated its value proposition over the sixteen
years of its existence, by delivering investment returns vastly superior to other mainstream
financial assets. Its unique characteristics - capped supply, infinite divisibility, immutability,
censorship-resistant decentralisation, and proof-of-work consensus mechanism - have
supported the rapid growth in Bitcoin adoption and associated increase in dollar value. The
recognition of Bitcoin as an unrivalled store of value is what led earlier this year to the US
Federal Government to initiate a policy of developing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. That
move alone de-risked the asset for corporates and will encourage rival governments to
make a similar move.
For investors looking for Bitcoin exposure, SWC is not an ETF, but a corporation, which can
use its legal status to issue securities in all relevant capital market segments in order to
accumulate more Bitcoin. Because there is a strong demand amongst a variety of investor
classes for the unique volatility of the underlying asset (BTC), it can issue securities (CB,
debt, equity) at prices favourable for the issuer. This means it can increase its BTC per
share over time, which means that an investor is likely to pay for some of that return in
advance through a premium to NAV. There is also a self-fulfilling element to this, in that the
reputation for increasing BTC yield leads to the premium which enables the company to
increase the BTC yield. The success of SWC in capturing the premium and creating the
flywheel which enables it to grow rapidly is due to its ability to mobilise the retail Bitcoin
army in the UK behind the company, supported by a sustained rally in the Bitcoin price.

Valuation and Recommendation
The global Bitcoin Treasury sector continues to attract significant premia to Bitcoin NAV, as
reflected in the table above. Especially the younger, smaller companies, who trade at the
largest premia. With SWC having proven its appeal to retail investors and the efficacy of its
model in delivering an mNAV premium, we are revising our target price to reflect its new
enlarged balance sheet. We believe the stock now warrants an mNAV premium of 9x
(assuming its cash resources are fully deployed into Bitcoin at the current spot price). As such,
we are setting our new 3-month target price at 38.4 pence per share, or 42% above the
current level, equivalent to a market cap of £66.8 million. We maintain our BUY
recommendation
