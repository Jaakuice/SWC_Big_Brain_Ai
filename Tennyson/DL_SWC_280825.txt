BUY
BITCOIN PURCHASE TAKES BTC STACK TO 2,440

28 August 2025
The UK’s flagship Bitcoin Treasury Company, The Smarter Web Company (SWC PZ) has announced a
£3.7 million purchase of Bitcoin, just days after confirming a £3.7 million equity raise from its ATM
facility. The purchase takes the company’s overall stack from 2,395 to 2,440, and makes it the
twenty-fifth biggest public company in the world in terms of Bitcoin on the balance sheet. The
purchase takes the company’s 30-day Bitcoin yield to 28% (or 0.9% per day). Overall in the 127 days
since its IPO in April, SWC has raised £202 million of external capital, of which 99% has been
deployed for Bitcoin purchases. The company’s Bitcoin treasury is currently valued at £204 million,
meaning SWC has generated a gain on its Bitcoin holdings of over £3.3 million since going public in
April with an IPO valuation just £3.7 million. This outstanding track record of executing on its
Bitcoin Treasury strategy is what has led analysts to view the company as “the fastest horse”.
Given the mNAV compression which has affected sentiment for all BTC treasury companies through
August, this morning’s news is a reminder to investors that the ATM facility continues to be a
significant competitive differentiator for SWC, which remains the only UK-listed player with such a
facility in place. The ability to continue to raise equity at market to fund accretive Bitcoin purchases
allows the company to maintain its Bitcoin yield even when market conditions are more
challenging. And it is why the combination of just mNAV of 1.9x and a P/BYD of 0.2x means the
stock remains attractively valued at current levels. We maintain our BUY recommendation.
