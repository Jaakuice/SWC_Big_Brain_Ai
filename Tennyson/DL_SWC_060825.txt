THE SMARTER WEB COMPANY PLC
(SWC PZ; TSWC US)
BUY
$21M RAISE THROUGH NEW “SMARTER CONVERT”
Tennyson Securities, Technology Research
6 August 2025
Leading UK Bitcoin Treasury Company, The Smarter Web Company (SWC PZ) has raised US$21
million (£15.8 million) through the issue of a new Bitcoin-denominated convertible bond
instrument, fully subscribed by TOBAM, a Paris-based institutional investor with a long track record
of specialising in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Treasury Companies. Under the terms of the instrument, the
amount of principal repayable after 12 months is indexed to the price performance of Bitcoin itself,
whilst TOBAM has the right to convert its investment (both partly and fully) into SWC shares at
204.75p, a 5% premium to last night’s closing price, at any time during the period. SWC also has the
right to call the bond at any point after the first six months of the period. The structure is highly
attractive to Bitcoin investors as it protects their Bitcoin returns, whilst gaining exposure to the
outperformance of SWC as it continues to monetize its mNAV premium through equity raises. It is
also very attractive to SWC as it enables the company to monetise its share price volatility, raise
further funds at a premium to deploy into its Bitcoin treasury, and strengthen its position for future
capital raising. Management said it is likely to issue similar instruments in future, alongside its
existing tools (institutional ABBs, direct subscriptions, ATM), albeit the total amount of Bitcoin
acquired through converts will be capped at 30% of its existing unencumbered BTC holdings.
We continue to expect the company to reach its current target of over 2,100 BTC within a matter of
days, which would make the company the twenty-fifth biggest public company in the world in
terms of quantity of Bitcoin on the balance sheet. Assuming all its cash is deployed into BTC at
current prices and using a diluted share count that includes the convert (an extra 7.72 million), the
shares now trade at an adjusted mNAV of just 2.8x. SWC has generated a BTC yield of 6.1% per
day in the last 100 days and now has a Days to mNAV cover of just 19 days, substantially faster
than the other names in the international peer group, such as Metaplanet (3350 JP), The Blockchain
Group (ALTBG FP) and Strategy (MSTR US). This rapid growth continues to grab the attention of
investors across the globe, further strengthening the company’s international reputation. Whilst
mNAV compression is to be expected over time, SWC’s ability to maintain its Daily Yield at such an
impressive level is what gives us conviction that the stock warrants a higher mNAV premium in the
near term than its major global peers.
