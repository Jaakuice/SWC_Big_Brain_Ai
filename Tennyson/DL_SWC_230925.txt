THE SMARTER WEB COMPANY PLC
(SWC PZ)
BUY
BITCOIN PURCHASE TAKES BTC STACK TO 2,525

23 September 2025
The UK’s flagship Bitcoin Treasury Company, The Smarter Web Company (SWC PZ) has announced a
£4.6 million purchase of Bitcoin, just a day after confirming a £5.0 million equity raise from its ATM
facility. The purchase takes the company’s overall stack from 2,470 to 2,525 and makes it the
twenty-ninth biggest public company in the world in terms of Bitcoin on the balance sheet. The
purchase increases the company’s sats per share 2.2% from 905 to 926 and takes its QTD Bitcoin
yield (the increase in sats per share) to 301%. Overall in the 153 days since its IPO in April, SWC has
raised £209 million of external capital, of which 99% has been deployed for Bitcoin purchases. The
company’s Bitcoin treasury is currently valued at £211 million, meaning SWC has generated a gain
on its Bitcoin holdings of c.£2.9 million since going public in April.
With signs that the mNAV compression which affected sentiment throughout August starting to
bottom out, this morning’s news is a reminder to investors that the ATM facility continues to be a
significant competitive differentiator for SWC, which remains the only UK-listed player with such a
facility in place. The ability to continue to raise equity at market to fund accretive Bitcoin purchases
allows the company to maintain its Bitcoin yield even when market conditions are more
challenging. And it is why at an mNAV of just 1.39x the stock remains attractively valued at current
levels. We maintain our BUY recommendation.
