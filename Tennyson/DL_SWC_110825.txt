THE SMARTER WEB COMPANY PLC
(SWC PZ)
BUY
£7.6M RAISED THROUGH ATM FACILITY
Tennyson Securities, Technology Research
11 August 2025
The UK’s flagship Bitcoin Treasury company, The Smarter Web Company (SWC PZ) has raised just over £7.6
million through its ATM facility and will receive the funds early this week in order to fund further purchases of
Bitcoin to add to its existing stack of 2,100. The company said it had placed 3.45 million shares over the last
fortnight through the facility at an average price of 221 pence per share. The ATM facility remains an important
tool the company has to expand the equity capital on its balance sheet, alongside the funds raised from
institutional bookbuilds, direct subscriptions and, most recently, the launch of its “Smarter Convert”. In
aggregate, SWC has now raised £197 million of capital since its IPO in April and now has over £25 million in cash
to add to its Bitcoin treasury of £190 million. With Bitcoin now touching £90,000 in spot price, the company is
already sitting on an unrealised gain in its treasury of over £18 million.
SWC shares now trade slightly below 3x mNAV, having witnessed a sector-wide multiple compression in recent
weeks. However, given the company’s consistent track record of delivering BTC yield, this means the days to
cover mNAV is close to its record low for the business (just 20 days), which is why we expect both the share price
and mNAV to grow strongly in the weeks ahead. We maintain our BUY recommendation.
