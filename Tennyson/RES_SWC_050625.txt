Smarter Web Company plc (SWC) BUY
MARKET DATA £13.4M RAISE TO ACCELERATE BITCOIN STRATEGY
Bloomberg Ticker SWC PZ Smarter Web Company (SWC PZ) has continued to cement its position as the UK’s flagship
Share price p/shr 81.00 Bitcoin Treasury company, with a further raise of £13.4 million at last night’s close of 81 pence
Target price p/shr 105.00 per share, with the proceeds used to accelerate the accumulation of Bitcoin in its corporate
TP upside % 30 treasury. Before the announcement, the company had approximately £13.9 million in
Shares out Million 204.1 treasury, consisting of 83.24 BTC and £7.4 million in cash. With the proceeds of this
Mkt cap £m 165.4 morning’s raise, the company will have approximately £20.3 million of cash to deploy into
additional Bitcoin in the weeks ahead. As a consequence, we now expect the company to
reach over 340 BTC within a matter of weeks.
With the shares trading at a solid premium to NAV, the raise is highly accretive to
shareholders in terms of Bitcoin yield. Assuming all its excess cash is deployed into BTC at
DESCRIPTION current prices, the transaction takes the stock’s mNAV from 10.9 to 6.2x - very similar to the
effect of the previous equity raise at 49p which took the multiple from 11.3x to 6.5x, only to

its strategy.
million was valued at £152.0 million at yesterday’s close, the transaction values the enlarged
treasury of £26.7 million at £165.3 million. With the total share count rising just 9%, this
represents an increase in BTC/share (when deployed) of 77%, or potential sats per share
from 95 to 168.
Higher mNAV multiples in the early months of a Bitcoin accumulation strategy are driven by
markets pricing in a company’s capacity to raise significant amounts of equity within a short
period (thereby quickly reducing the mNAV multiple to a much lower level). SWC has
generated a BTC yield of 8.5% per day in the last 40 days and has a Days to mNAV cover of
just 39 days at the current price (significantly below the larger listed companies in the
space). “Days to mNAV Cover” is the time it takes for a Bitcoin Treasury Company to reduce
its mNAV to one if it continues to increase its Bitcoin Yield (satoshis per share) at the current
rate of growth.
Why do we think that SWC can continue to replicate that Bitcoin Yield in future? Not by
extrapolating the success of its first two months (since mathematically each subsequent raise
needs to be bigger and better), but by viewing the competitive position of the company in

SWC has already demonstrated significant traction amongst UK retail investors, and it is this
following which will allow the company to grow rapidly using the tried and tested Bitcoin
Treasury strategy made famous by Michael Saylor and Strategy Inc. (MSTR US). Backed by its
key original investor UTXO, part of BTC Inc., and allied to the largest Bitcoin-focused media
outfit, Bitcoin Magazine, SWC management is well positioned to use this successful start as a
springboard to accelerate its Bitcoin accumulation, as it seeks to tap different pools of capital,

whether in different product segments or geographies. SWC is fast developing a reputation
with investors across the globe as the ‘UK flagship’ of the Bitcoin Treasury sector, with a
leadership team that benefits from global expertise and sector relationships unmatched by
any UK rival, existing or potential. Only last week, Andrew Webley, SWC CEO, was
showcased at the 2025 Bitcoin Conference in Las Vegas, an event attended by over 30,000
Bitcoiners from across the world.
There is a a wave of international capital supporting corporates moving onto a Bitcoin
Standard. There are over 90 public companies deploying the model, including Metaplanet
(3350 JP) in Japan, Blockchain Group (ALTG FP) in France, and Twenty One (CEP US), Strive
Asset Management (ASST US) and Nakamoto (KDLY US) in the United States. Each of these
is demonstrating clearly that a well-executed Bitcoin treasury strategy can deliver exceptional
shareholder returns on the back of solid mNAV premia which in turn create a significant
competitive edge in the capital markets, one which traditional corporates, however successful
in fiat terms, are failing to offer their shareholders.
SWC Increasing Bitcoin Yield
The company announced a further acquisition of 39.5 BTC this taking its overall BTC position
to 122.8 BTC.
SWC has announced a further acquisition of BTC this morning, taking its holdings from 83.24
to 122.76. This move increases its actual sats per share from 44 to 60 and increases its daily
Bitcoin yield since IPO to 8.9%. In the same way, it reduces its days to cover from 39 to just
33. Below we show an analysis of the company’s Bitcoin accumulation in the 43 days since
IPO.

Bitcoin Treasury Basics – A Reminder
Bitcoin is a unique digital asset that has demonstrated its value proposition over the sixteen
years of its existence, by delivering investment returns vastly superior to other mainstream
financial assets. Its unique characteristics - capped supply, infinite divisibility, immutability,
censorship-resistant decentralisation, and proof-of-work consensus mechanism - have
supported the rapid growth in Bitcoin adoption and associated increase in dollar value. The
recognition of Bitcoin as an unrivalled store of value is what led earlier this year to the US
Federal Government to initiate a policy of developing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. That
move alone de-risked the asset for corporates and will encourage rival governments to
make a similar move.
For investors looking for Bitcoin exposure, SWC is not an ETF, but a corporation, which can
use its legal status to issue securities in all relevant capital market segments in order to
accumulate more Bitcoin. Because there is a strong demand amongst a variety of investor
classes for the unique volatility of the underlying asset (BTC), it can issue securities (CB,
debt, equity) at prices favourable for the issuer. This means it can increase its BTC per
share over time, which means that an investor is likely to pay for some of that return in
advance through a premium to NAV. There is also a self-fulfilling element to this, in that the
reputation for increasing BTC yield leads to the premium which enables the company to
increase the BTC yield. The success of SWC in capturing the premium and creating the
flywheel which enables it to grow rapidly is due to its ability to mobilise the retail Bitcoin
army in the UK behind the company, supported by a sustained rally in the Bitcoin price.

Valuation and Recommendation
The global Bitcoin Treasury sector continues to attract significant premia to Bitcoin NAV, as
reflected in the table above. Especially the younger, smaller companies, who trade at the
largest premia. With SWC having proven its appeal to retail investors and the efficacy of its
model in delivering an mNAV premium, we are revising our target price to reflect its new
enlarged balance sheet. We believe the stock now warrants an mNAV premium of 8.0x
(assuming its cash resources are fully deployed into Bitcoin at the current spot price). As such,
we are setting our new 3-month target price at 105 pence per share, or 30% above the
current level, equivalent to a market cap of £214.8 million. We maintain our BUY
recommendation
