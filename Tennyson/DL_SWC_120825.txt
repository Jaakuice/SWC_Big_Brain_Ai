THE SMARTER WEB COMPANY PLC
(SWC PZ)
BUY
BITCOIN PURCHASE TAKES BTC STACK TO 2,395
Tennyson Securities, Technology Research
12 August 2025
The UK’s flagship Bitcoin Treasury Company, The Smarter Web Company (SWC PZ) has announced a
£26.3 million purchase of Bitcoin, taking its overall stack from 2,100 to 2,395, and making it the
twenty-third biggest public company in the world in terms of Bitcoin on the balance sheet. The
purchase takes the company’s daily average Bitcoin yield during the 111 days since its IPO in April to
5.9%. Over that same period, the company has raised £198 million of external capital, of which 99%
has been deployed for Bitcoin purchases. The company’s Bitcoin treasury is currently valued at
£212 million, meaning SWC has generated a gain on its Bitcoin holdings of over £14 million since
going public in April with an IPO valuation just £3.7 million. This outstanding track record of
executing on its Bitcoin Treasury strategy is what has led analysts to view the company as “the
fastest horse”. And it is why the combination of a mNAV of 2.9x and a Days to Cover of only 19
means the stock remains attractively valued at current levels. We maintain our BUY
recommendation.
