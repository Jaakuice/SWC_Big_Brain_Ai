BUY
£19.6M BITCOIN PURCHASE INCREASED BTC STACK TO 1,825
Tennyson Securities, Technology Research
25 July 2025
Leading UK Bitcoin Treasury Company, The Smarter Web Company (SWC PZ) has purchased an
additional 225 BTC for £19.6 million, increasing its Bitcoin stack from 1,600 to 1,825, and making it
the twenty-third biggest public company in the world in terms of quantity of Bitcoin on the
balance sheet. Including cash at hand of approximately £1.0 million, the company now has
approximately £158 million in treasury, which will be further bolstered when the latest results of its
ATM-like facility (14 million shares) are announced shortly, likely to raise £30-40 million given the
current share price.
With the shares trading at a mNAV premium of 3.2x, the company continues to aggressively pursue
its strategy of accretive equity raises that grow its Bitcoin per share. Since its IPO in April, SWC has
already seen its Sats per share rise from 2 to 728, with an average daily BTC yield of 6.9% and a Days
to mNAV Cover of just 17 at the current share price.
Whilst mNAV compression is to be expected over time and is a mathematical fact of life in the
development of Bitcoin Treasury Companies, SWC’s ability to maintain its Daily Yield at such an
impressive level is what gives us conviction that the stock warrants a higher mNAV premium in the
near term than its major global peers. The shares now trade at the lowest mNAV multiple since
IPO, and as can be seen in the charts below, the mNAV compression of recent days has been greater
than the more gradual decline in its 30-day BTC yield, leading to the lowest level for P/BYD the
shares have seen since listing. We believe the shares are oversold and maintain our BUY
recommendation.
