The UK’s flagship Bitcoin Treasury company, The Smarter Web Company (SWC PZ) has raised just
over £19.68 million in the second tranche of its ATM facility and will receive the funds “early this
week” in order to fund further purchases of Bitcoin to add to its existing stack of 1,825. The
company said it had placed 6.06 million shares over the last three weeks through the facility at an
average price of 325 pence per share, a significant premium to last Friday’s closing price
(217.5p). Management further announced it had decided to continue to report updates on the ATM
facility every two weeks in order that funds can be collected more quickly, and that it expects to sign
a further subscription agreement on the same terms once the remainder of the current tranche of
14 million shares is placed under the existing facility. This is a very positive development that
enables the company to accelerate its planned Bitcoin purchases and provide investors with a more
frequent and predictable outlook for the ATM, which remains one of the most important tools the
company has to expand the equity capital on its balance sheet.
With the shares trading at a premium to NAV, the fresh equity raise is highly accretive to
shareholders in terms of Bitcoin yield, increasing potential sats per share from 728 to 798 (over 300x
the value on the day of the company’s IPO in April). Having now raised over £167 million since April,
SWC has rapidly developed an international reputation as one of the fastest growing corporate
Bitcoin treasuries in global public equity markets, with a daily BTC yield of 6.6% since IPO, Days to
Cover mNAV of just 20. and the resources to increase its Bitcoin holdings to over 2,000 BTC within
the coming days. SWC shares now trade on an adjusted mNAV of just 3.1x, which looks very
attractive given its very high BTC yield and its outstanding track record of maintaining its current
trajectory, not least through developing a range of capital market tools to raise fresh capital to
continue to build its Bitcoin treasury. We maintain our BUY recommendation.
