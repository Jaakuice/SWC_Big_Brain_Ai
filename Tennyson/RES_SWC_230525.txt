Smarter Web Company plc (SWC) BUY
MARKET DATA £6.8M RAISE TO ACCELERATE BITCOIN STRATEGY
Bloomberg Ticker SWC PZ Smarter Web Company (SWC PZ) has continued to cement its position as the UK’s flagship
Share price p/shr 49.00 Bitcoin Treasury company, with a further raise of £6.8 million at last night’s close of 49 pence
Target price p/shr 64.00 per share, with the proceeds used to accelerate the accumulation of Bitcoin in its corporate
TP upside % 31 treasury. Before the announcement, the company had approximately £7.6 million in treasury,
Shares out Million 187.6 consisting of 35.62 BTC and £4.6 million in cash. With the proceeds of this morning’s raise,
Mkt cap £m 103.2 the company will have approximately £11.2 million of cash to deploy into additional Bitcoin
in the weeks ahead. As a consequence we now expect the company to reach over 170 BTC
within a matter of weeks.
With the shares trading at a solid premium to NAV, the raise is highly accretive to
shareholders in terms of Bitcoin yield. Assuming all its excess cash is deployed into BTC at
DESCRIPTION current prices, the transaction takes the stock’s mNAV from 11.3 to 6.5x - very similar to the
effect of the previous equity raise at 27p which took the multiple from 10.5x to 6.2x, only to

million was valued at £85.1 million at yesterday’s close, the transaction values the enlarged
treasury of £14.1 million at £91.9 million. With the total share count rising just 8%, this
represents an increase in BTC/share (when deployed) of 73%, or potential sats per share
from 52 to 90.
Higher mNAV multiples in the early months of a Bitcoin accumulation strategy are driven by
markets pricing in a company’s capacity to raise significant amounts of equity within a short
period (thereby quickly reducing the mNAV multiple to a much lower level). SWC has
generated a BTC yield of 9.6% per day in the last 20 days and has a Days to mNAV cover of
just 37 days at the current price (significantly below the larger listed companies in the
space). “Days to mNAV Cover” is the time it takes for a Bitcoin Treasury Company to reduce
its mNAV to one if it continues to increase its Bitcoin Yield (satoshis per share) at the current
rate of growth.
Why do we think that SWC can continue to replicate that Bitcoin Yield in future? Not by
extrapolating the success of its first two months (since mathematically each subsequent raise
needs to be bigger and better), but by viewing the competitive position of the company in

the capital markets as the critical criterion for success. 1) First mover advantage in the UK

of overseas capital.
Looking at the competition in the UK capital markets gives us real grounds for
encouragement. The emergence of copycat strategies at minor crypto plays, like Coinsilium
or Vinanz, simply underscores SWC’s strengths. These companies have no global following,
no operating cash flow, balance sheets contaminated by various illiquid private equity
investments (in the case of COIN), high capex requirements (in the case of Vinanz), and are
both rightly seen as “crypto funds” rather than orthodox Bitcoin Treasury companies. We do

not see either company producing the necessary launch velocity to reach the size required to
attract global capital.
SWC has already demonstrated significant traction amongst UK retail investors, and it is this
following which will allow the company to grow rapidly using the tried and tested Bitcoin
Treasury strategy made famous by Michael Saylor and Strategy Inc. (MSTR US). Backed by its
key original investor UTXO, part of BTC Inc., and allied to the largest Bitcoin-focused media
outfit, Bitcoin Magazine, SWC management is well positioned to use this successful start as a
springboard to accelerate its Bitcoin accumulation, as it seeks to tap different pools of capital,
whether in different product segments or geographies. SWC is fast developing a reputation
with investors across the globe as the ‘UK flagship’ of the Bitcoin Treasury sector, with a
leadership team that benefits from global expertise and sector relationships unmatched by
any UK rival, existing or potential. As early next week, Andrew Webley, SWC CEO, will be
showcased at the 2025 Bitcoin Conference in Las Vegas, an event attended by over 30,000
Bitcoiners from across the world.
There is a a wave of international capital supporting corporates moving onto a Bitcoin
Standard. There are over 90 public companies deploying the model, including Metaplanet
(3350 JP) in Japan, Blockchain Group (ALTG FP) in France, and Twenty One (CEP US), Strive
Asset Management (ASST US) and Nakamoto (KDLY US) in the United States. Each of these
is demonstrating clearly that a well-executed Bitcoin treasury strategy can deliver exceptional
shareholder returns on the back of solid mNAV premia which in turn create a significant
competitive edge in the capital markets, one which traditional corporates, however successful
in fiat terms, are failing to offer their shareholders.
SWC Increasing Bitcoin Yield
SWC has announced a further acquisition of BTC this morning, taking its holdings from 35.62
to 58.71. This move increases its actual sats per share from 21 to 31 and increases its daily
Bitcoin yield since IPO to 10.5%. In the same way, it reduces its days to cover from 37 to just
29. Below we show an analysis of the company’s Bitcoin accumulation in the 30 days since
IPO.

Bitcoin Treasury Basics – A Reminder
Bitcoin is a unique digital asset that has demonstrated its value proposition over the sixteen
years of its existence, by delivering investment returns vastly superior to other mainstream
financial assets. Its unique characteristics - capped supply, infinite divisibility, immutability,
censorship-resistant decentralisation, and proof-of-work consensus mechanism - have
supported the rapid growth in Bitcoin adoption and associated increase in dollar value. The
recognition of Bitcoin as an unrivalled store of value is what led earlier this year to the US
Federal Government to initiate a policy of developing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. That
move alone de-risked the asset for corporates and will encourage rival governments to
make a similar move.
For investors looking for Bitcoin exposure, SWC is not an ETF, but a corporation, which can
use its legal status to issue securities in all relevant capital market segments in order to
accumulate more Bitcoin. Because there is a strong demand amongst a variety of investor
classes for the unique volatility of the underlying asset (BTC), it can issue securities (CB,
debt, equity) at prices favourable for the issuer. This means it can increase its BTC per
share over time, which means that an investor is likely to pay for some of that return in
advance through a premium to NAV. There is also a self-fulfilling element to this, in that the
reputation for increasing BTC yield leads to the premium which enables the company to
increase the BTC yield. The success of SWC in capturing the premium and creating the
flywheel which enables it to grow rapidly is due to its ability to mobilise the retail Bitcoin
army in the UK behind the company, supported by a sustained rally in the Bitcoin price.

Valuation and Recommendation
The global Bitcoin Treasury sector continues to attract significant premia to Bitcoin NAV, as
reflected in the table above. Especially the younger, smaller companies, who trade at the
largest premia. With SWC having proven its appeal to retail investors and the efficacy of its
model in delivering an mNAV premium, we are revising our target price to reflect its new
enlarged balance sheet. We believe the stock now warrants an mNAV premium of 8.5x
(assuming its cash resources are fully deployed into Bitcoin at the current spot price). As such,
we are setting our new 3-month target price at 64 pence per share, or 42% above the current
level, equivalent to a market cap of £120.1 million. We maintain our BUY recommendation
