Mkt cap £m 682.8 this morning’s raise, the company will have approximately £55.8 million of cash to deploy into
additional Bitcoin in the weeks ahead. As a consequence we now expect the company to
reach over 1,200 BTC within a matter of weeks and to surpass the much heralded 1,000 BTC
target within a matter of days.
With the shares trading at a solid premium to NAV, the raise is highly accretive to
DESCRIPTION shareholders in terms of Bitcoin yield. Assuming all its excess cash is deployed into BTC at
current prices, the transaction takes the stock’s mNAV from 10.9x to 6.9x - very similar to

the accretive nature of the transaction . Put another way, whilst the company’s treasury of
£59.0 million was valued at £641.6 million at yesterday’s close, this morning”s transaction
values the enlarged treasury of £98.6 million at £682.8 million. With the total share count
rising just 6%, this represents an increase in BTC/share (when deployed) of 55%, or potential
sats per share from 339 to 533. In terms of actual sats per share, the company has already
increased its number from 2 to 246 since IPO.
Higher mNAV multiples in the early months of a Bitcoin accumulation strategy are driven by
markets pricing in a company’s capacity to raise significant amounts of equity within a short
period (thereby quickly reducing the mNAV multiple to a much lower level). SWC has
generated a BTC yield of 8.4% per day in the last 63 days and has a Days to mNAV cover of
just 33 days at the current price. Comparing the company with its major peers at the same
time in their development makes clear why one influential Bitcoin analyst in the US market
has called SWC “the fastest horse” in the race and is what justifies its relatively higher current
mNAV rating.

Why do we think that SWC can continue to replicate that Bitcoin Yield in future? Not by
extrapolating the success of its first two months (since mathematically each subsequent raise
needs to be bigger and better), but by viewing the competitive position of the company in
the capital markets as the critical criterion for success. 1) First mover advantage in the UK
capital markets creates the size and awareness that makes SWC the first port of call for
Bitcoin-hungry capital; 2) High levels of trust in the leadership team have been secured
already, which is critical in creating expectations that the strategy will be delivered to plan; 3)
Political hostility to BTC in the UK, combined with cultural conservatism in the UK business
establishment makes it very difficult for FTSE350 CFOs to make a pivot to Bitcoin, leaving the
field open for startups; and 4) International support means that SWC is already on the radar
of overseas capital.
SWC has already demonstrated significant traction amongst institutional and retail investors
in both the UK and the US, and it is this following which will allow the company to grow rapidly
using the tried and tested Bitcoin Treasury strategy made famous by Michael Saylor and
Strategy Inc. (MSTR US). Backed by its key original investor UTXO, part of BTC Inc., and allied
to the largest Bitcoin-focused media outfit, Bitcoin Magazine, SWC management is well
positioned to use this successful start as a springboard to accelerate its Bitcoin accumulation,
as it seeks to tap different pools of capital, whether in different product segments or
geographies. SWC is fast developing a reputation with investors across the globe as the ‘UK

flagship’ of the Bitcoin Treasury sector, with a leadership team that benefits from global
expertise and sector relationships unmatched by any UK rival, existing or potential. Earlier
this month, Andrew Webley, SWC CEO, was showcased at the 2025 Bitcoin Conference in
Las Vegas, an event attended by over 30,000 Bitcoiners from across the world. More
recently, the company appointed renowned Bitcoiner, Jesse Myers as its Bitcoin Strategic
Consultant to further cement its brand and mission amongst investors worldwide.
There is a a wave of international capital supporting corporates moving onto a Bitcoin
Standard. There are over 100 public companies deploying the model, including Metaplanet
(3350 JP) in Japan, Blockchain Group (ALTG FP) in France, and Twenty One (CEP US), Strive
Asset Management (ASST US) and Nakamoto (KDLY US) in the United States. Each of these
is demonstrating clearly that a well-executed Bitcoin treasury strategy can deliver exceptional
shareholder returns on the back of solid mNAV premia which in turn create a significant
competitive edge in the capital markets, one which traditional corporates, however successful
in fiat terms, are failing to offer their shareholders.

Bitcoin Treasury Basics – A Reminder
Bitcoin is a unique digital asset that has demonstrated its value proposition over the sixteen
years of its existence, by delivering investment returns vastly superior to other mainstream
financial assets. Its unique characteristics - capped supply, infinite divisibility, immutability,
censorship-resistant decentralisation, and proof-of-work consensus mechanism - have
supported the rapid growth in Bitcoin adoption and associated increase in dollar value. The
recognition of Bitcoin as an unrivalled store of value is what led earlier this year to the US
Federal Government to initiate a policy of developing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. That
move alone de-risked the asset for corporates and will encourage rival governments to
make a similar move.
For investors looking for Bitcoin exposure, SWC is not an ETF, but a corporation, which can
use its legal status to issue securities in all relevant capital market segments in order to
accumulate more Bitcoin. Because there is a strong demand amongst a variety of investor
classes for the unique volatility of the underlying asset (BTC), it can issue securities (CB,
debt, equity) at prices favourable for the issuer. This means it can increase its BTC per
share over time, which means that an investor is likely to pay for some of that return in
advance through a premium to NAV. There is also a self-fulfilling element to this, in that the
reputation for increasing BTC yield leads to the premium which enables the company to
increase the BTC yield. The success of SWC in capturing the premium and creating the
flywheel which enables it to grow rapidly is due to its ability to mobilise the retail Bitcoin
army in the UK behind the company, supported by a sustained rally in the Bitcoin price.
Valuation and Recommendation
The global Bitcoin Treasury sector continues to attract significant premia to Bitcoin NAV.
Especially the younger, smaller companies, who trade at the largest premia. With SWC having
proven its appeal to retail investors and the efficacy of its model in delivering an mNAV
premium, we are revising our target price to reflect its new enlarged balance sheet. Given
the company’s market leading daily BTC yield and the likelihood of new sources of
international capital being attracted now the company has reached a bigger size, we believe
the stock warrants a short-term mNAV premium of 10.0x (see the relationship in the table
below). As such, we are setting our new 3-month target price at 425 pence per share, or 47%
above the current level, equivalent to a market cap of £940 million. We maintain our BUY
recommendation
