THE SMARTER WEB COMPANY PLC
(SWC PZ)
BUY
1,000 BTC MILESTONE; £10M RAISE FROM DIRECT SUBSCRIPTION
Tennyson Securities, Technology Research
9 July 2025
The UK’s flagship Bitcoin Treasury company, The Smarter Web Company (SWC PZ) has raised just
over £10.3 million through a direct investor subscription at last night’s closing price, 325p per
share. This comes just two days after the company announced it had reached the key milestone of
accumulating 1,000 BTC just 75 days after its IPO; and had raised £22.9 million through the first
tranche of its pioneering ATM-style facility, which saw it sell 7 million new shares in the market over
just twelve trading days.
Having now raised over £130 million since April, The Smarter Web Company (SWC PZ) has rapidly
developed an international reputation as one of the fastest growing corporate Bitcoin treasuries in
global public equity markets, with a daily BTC yield of 7.5% since IPO, Days to Cover mNAV of just 32.
and the cash resources to increase its Bitcoin holdings to over 1,600 BTC. SWC shares now trade on
an adjusted mNAV of just 6.5x, which looks very attractive given its very high BTC yield and its
outstanding track record of maintaining its current trajectory, not least through developing a range
of capital market tools to raise fresh capital to continue to build its Bitcoin treasury. We maintain
our BUY recommendation.
