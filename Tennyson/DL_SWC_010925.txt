1 September 2025
The UK’s flagship Bitcoin Treasury Company, The Smarter Web Company (SWC PZ) has announced
the appointment of both a Chief Financial Officer and a new Corporate Adviser ahead of a likely
uplisting to the LSE main market in the coming months. New CFO, Albert Soleiman was previously
CFO of CMC Markets, a FTSE 250 financial services company, where he was responsible for “building
out its investment platform and leading a strategic alignment of the business.” New Corporate
Adviser, Strand Hanson , brings a wealth of experience advising UK companies, including as an LSE
Sponsor, “navigating the regulatory framework of the Main Market”.
SWC shares continue to look attractive relative to its global peers, especially given its outstanding
track record of delivering market-leading BTC yield, backed by a combination of institutional equity
raises and its unique ATM facility. In the 131 days since its IPO in April, SWC has raised £202 million
of external capital, of which 99% has been deployed for Bitcoin purchases, enabling the company to
increase its sats per share (SPS) from 2 to 914 over the same period (see below). SWC shares now
trade on an mNAV multiple of just 1.6x at current levels, significantly below Capital B (ALCPBF FP)
Satsuma (SATS LN) and H100 (H100 SS) (see table below), We maintain our BUY recommendation.
