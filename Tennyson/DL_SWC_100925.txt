THE SMARTER WEB COMPANY PLC
(SWC PZ)
BUY
BITCOIN PURCHASE TAKES BTC STACK TO 2,470

10 September 2025
The UK’s flagship Bitcoin Treasury Company, The Smarter Web Company (SWC PZ) has announced a
£2.5 million purchase of Bitcoin, just days after confirming a £2.6 million equity raise from its ATM
facility. The purchase takes the company’s overall stack from 2,440 to 2,470 and makes it the
twenty-fifth biggest public company in the world in terms of Bitcoin on the balance sheet. The
purchase increases the company’s sats per share 1.2% from 907 to 918 and takes its 30-day Bitcoin
yield to 16% (or 0.5% per day). Overall in the 140 days since its IPO in April, SWC has raised £204
million of external capital, of which 99% has been deployed for Bitcoin purchases. The company’s
Bitcoin treasury is currently valued at £203 million, meaning SWC has generated a gain on its Bitcoin
holdings of approx.. £1.1 million since going public in April.
With signs that the mNAV compression which affected sentiment throughout August starting to
bottom out, this morning’s news is a reminder to investors that the ATM facility continues to be a
significant competitive differentiator for SWC, which remains the only UK-listed player with such a
facility in place. The ability to continue to raise equity at market to fund accretive Bitcoin purchases
allows the company to maintain its Bitcoin yield even when market conditions are more
challenging. And it is why the combination of an mNAV of just 2.1x and a P/BYD of 0.4x means the
stock remains attractively valued at current levels. We maintain our BUY recommendation.
