    "text": "The price action for SWC has been rough.  And very much in line with the sector-wide trend for BTCTCs.  In many ways, I think we are collectively waiting for Metaplanet (the largest of the young pure play BTCTCs) to form a bottom.\n\nIt's helpful to take stock of what you own when you own shares in a BTCTC.\n\nFirst, your shares own their portion of the BTCTC's treasury.  Aquis is showing closing bid price of 55p per SWC share.  This means SWC's mNAV is 0.76x (and if you include all warrants exercisable in future years, it's ~1.01x).  Meaning, depending on how you look at it, the BTC owned by each share today can be purchased at a discount or at ~1x.\n\nSecond, your shares own a slice of all future productivity of the company, including all BTC Yield.  In Q3,\n@smarterwebuk\nincreased Bitcoin per share by +278%.  We are 2.5 weeks into Q4 and SWC has already delivered +0.5% BTC Yield without including all warrants, and +1.5% if you include all warrants.  That's during a climate of extreme fear.\n\nEven if you take a somewhat pessimistic view and assume that SWC will generate only +10% BTC Yield each quarter into the future, how do you value that?  In 4 years, you would have multiplied your BTC position by 4.6x. \n\nReasonable people could disagree on how to value that in present terms, but it would be difficult to argue that the value of that should be at OR UNDER 1x mNAV.\n\nOverall, I can't help but notice the parallels between how BTCTCs have been trading and how altcoins trade.  Both have been largely sentiment driven trends.  But what's different about BTCTCs is that they accumulate the best store of value asset in the world -\n#Bitcoin\n.\n\nWhile altcoin valuations are based on the perception of their value (and can and usually do go to zero), BTCTCs have a Bitcoin per share valuation.  When well-run, this value rises over time.  \n\nFor SWC, we now hold 54.5p of Bitcoin for every share (including all warrants exercisable in future years).  \n\nIn this sense, the \"floor\" for the fundamental value of a well-run BTCTC is quite real and rises over time.  (Note that there are many BTCTCs who do not have a track record of increasing Bitcoin per share over time, so this assessment does not extend to them.)\n\nUltimately, this is what makes a BTCTC very different from altcoins... even if people feel like they don't have any valuation floor, in terms of balance sheet value, they do.  It's the Bitcoin NAV they've accumulated!  (See related chart for SWC from\n@BitcoinJimmy21\n)\n\nFinally, my view is that a well-run BTCTC amplifies Bitcoin's attractive volatility. \n\n30-day volatility currently:\n- Bitcoin  ~40%\n- SWC ~150%\n\nThe market has to move quickly and sharply to digest the fast growth of a well-run BTCTC.  This is painful at times, and the sharpness of that pain has a way of disabusing folks of their prior conviction.  \n\nAt such times, it's helpful to take stock of the fundamentals of what you're holding.  Is it an altcoin that can go to zero?  Or does it have a balance sheet with fundamental value?  \n\n\"The beauty of stocks is they do sell at silly prices from time to time.\" - Warren Buffett",
