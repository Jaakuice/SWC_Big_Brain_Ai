You got more and more excited, thinking this could be big.  This could change the world.\n\nYour friends and family thought you were crazy.  They pitied you.  You had lost your mind; fallen for an internet scam, a Ponzi scheme.  They lost respect for you.\n\nBut you trusted yourself.  You defied the herd.\n\nYou put your financial future on your back.  You risked your whole world.  Your family's future.  For this idea.\n\nThe road has been harder than you expected.  The crashes, the emotional rollercoaster, but you stayed true to reason and kept stacking.\n\nAnd now look what’s unfolding.\n\nYou were right.  And the herd is slowly realizing they’ve been on the wrong course.  They’re coming to follow you.\n\nYou risked everything.  But it wasn’t a gamble.  You just saw what they did not, could not.\n\nBitcoin is winning.  You are winning.  And your family is winning - because of you.\n\nThey may not appreciate it yet.  But they will.\n\nUntil then, I know what you risked and what it took - and I’m fucking proud of you. \n\nYou've earned a moment of victory.  What will you do to enjoy this weekend?",

    "text": "Strategy is a pump - designed to accelerate the flow of capital from Bonds into\n#Bitcoin\n.\n\nThat’s the mental model to best understand what Strategy is doing.\n\nThe other night, I shared this breakdown with 40,000 livestream participants on\n@MSTRTrueNorth\n.  Saylor retweeted the broadcast.  He wants you to know what he’s doing….\n\nSaylor recently said in an interview “Look, we’re tapping into the bond market… there’s $300T in fixed income, so I want 1% of it.”\n\nHe knows there is $300T of capital sitting in Bonds getting not great returns.  He shares my chart (see image) in all of his presentations because it sets the stage for what Strategy is designed to do.\n\nIt's what\n@BitcoinPierre\ncoined the \"speculative attack.\"\n\nAs of now, 10-year US Treasury bills deliver 4.2% annually.  Other bonds, a bit more than that.  \n\nMeanwhile, Saylor expects Bitcoin to grow at +50% per year in the near term (and slowing down gradually from there).\n\nLegendary investor Paul Tudor Jones came to a similar conclusion, forecasting Bitcoin as \"the fastest horse this decade\".\n\nStrategy is leveraging that performance gap between Bonds and Bitcoin for the benefit of its shareholders.\n\nTo date, they’ve done that by issuing individual Convertible Notes to institutional buyers.  But, the Convertible Note market is just 2% of the overall Bond market.  Now, Saylor will be able to tap into the rest of it.\n\n$300T of capital is looking for stable, reliable, mid-single-digit returns every year.  Strategy is willing to offer that, and better.  With\n$STRK\nand\n$STRF\n, Strategy is offering 10% and 11.8% annually, respectively.\n\nWhen fixed income portfolio managers take them up on that offer, they buy\n$STRK\nor\n$STRF\nshares.  In doing so, they hand over dollars to Strategy in exchange for the promise of 10-12% reliable annual yield.\n\nStrategy takes those dollars and buys Bitcoin.  Saylor knows that Bitcoin’s growth will vastly outpace the 10-12% annual interest expense on this debt (in the form of dividends).  \n\nSure, it will be volatile along the way, but the average performance over a 4+ year timeline is what matters.\n\nHow much money would you borrow if it cost you 10% per year and you could make 50% per year with that capital?  As much as you possibly could.  \n\nAnd how much capital getting reliable, mid-single-digit annual returns would be interested in reliable, 10-12% annual returns instead?  At least 1% of that capital pool, in Saylor’s estimation.\n\nThat comes out to $3T of capital sitting in Bonds that Saylor expects to be able to attract to his new\n$STRK\nand\n$STRF\nofferings.\n\nWhat that means for\n$MSTR\nshareholders... Saylor expects to add $3T of Bitcoin to the balance sheet over the coming years.  All of it will deliver accretive dilution, meaning  +BTC Yield to shareholders.\n\nAnd what that means for Bitcoin is just as wild.  Bitcoin is a $2T asset right now.  Strategy - just a single company - expects to deploy $3T of buying power over the coming years.\n\nTo date, Bitcoin’s growth has come from the natural, osmotic flow of capital from existing asset buckets to Bitcoin.  \n\nWhat that requires is individuals actively deciding to re-allocate some of their portfolio - for example, selling some of their Bonds, then using that money to buy Bitcoin.\n\nThis osmotic process will continue as Bitcoin de-monetizes other asset categories while it monetizes as the most attractive store-of-value asset in human history.\n\nAnd now, Strategy has turned itself into a pump to accelerate that osmotic flow.  And with the launch of STRK and STRF, they have greatly upgraded their machinery.\n\nThe result will be millions of $ per Bitcoin and Strategy becoming the most valuable company on earth.  \n\nAre you paying attention?",
