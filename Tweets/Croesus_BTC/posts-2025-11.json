    "text": "I've been thinking about 3 charts recently.  A bit cerebral, so bear with me.\n\n1) Smarter Web's share price in BTC terms vs. the company's BTC holdings per share.  This shows that blue line growth in Sats per share has slowed (for now).  It also shows that the orange line mNAV premium has sold off and we are currently trading at a discount to NAV (for now).  If the blue line is fundamentals, the delta to the orange line provides a rough measure of sentiment.  (Forgive the US date convention in this charting tool)\n\n2) My mental model of Bitcoin's price cycles.  This ultra-simplified view (that I first made ~3 years ago) attempts to reduce Bitcoin's price action to the underlying mechanics, as I see them.  Bitcoin grows in a series of bubbles, each one setting a higher low, as the fundamentals of the asset improve.  In other words, Bitcoin has cycles of boom and bust driven by human psychology - meanwhile, the underlying value of the asset serially improves.  I believe that well-run BTCTCs share these characteristics, in the sense that BTC per share increases over time, while sentiment about the value proposition of a BTCTC oscillates hot and cold.  If this is true for SWC, this would simply mean we are in the refractory period of our first cycle.\n\n3) Growing degree days.  This concept from weather / agriculture shows the cumulative solar energy experienced through one full annual cycle.  Aka, the integral of a sine wave of annual sunshine.  What's interesting to me is that this visually represents the growing season as the steep part of an S curve, and the winters as flat plateaus.  I've been thinking about it because of the blue line from 1.  And of course, with the sun's annual cycle, the next year stacks a new S curve on top.  Make hay when the sun shines.\n\nNow, the relevant metaphorical question for a BTCTC investor is \"will sentiment swing to the positive ever again with regard to the value proposition of BTCTCs?\"\n\nNobody knows for certain.  But I see sine waves and cyclicality in Bitcoin market psychology.  This is nothing new for Bitcoin itself, and only amplified for assets that grow BTC ownership.\n\nJust thought I would share what I've been thinking about as we look forward to making the most of the next chapter for SWC.",
