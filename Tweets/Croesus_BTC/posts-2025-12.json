    "text": "Unpopular opinion:\n#Bitcoin\nis a Store-of-Value asset; its use as a transactional currency is ancillary.\n@saylor\nhas cleanly re-branded the SoV element as Digital Capital.  This is spot on.\n\nSoV sounds like a descriptor, not a purpose.  Digital Capital makes it clear that this is Bitcoin's purpose.  \n\n\"Digital cash\" was always just a misnomer.  Satoshi might not have fully understood what he unleashed.  Or maybe he did, but marketed it based on its simplest value proposition to get the network effects snowballing.\n\nBitcoin's highest and best use is as unconfiscatable savings, as collateral, as digital bedrock for global finance - both for individuals and corporations.  \n\nUncensorable transactability is a key enabler to its viability, but ultimately Digital Capital is 99% of the societal value of Bitcoin.",
