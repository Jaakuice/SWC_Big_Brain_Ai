    "text": "It was a volatile week for\n@smarterwebuk\nstock.  Alongside this,\n#SWC\n$TSWCF\nannounced its biggest\n#Bitcoin\nbuy, the biggest fundraise, and had many positive meetings.  I thought it might be helpful to share a few analytics that I have been looking at.  \n\nHere is a view of the company’s market cap alongside the company’s treasury assets (cash + Bitcoin) over time.  You’ll notice that while one had a volatile week, the other continued on its trajectory.  (Note: numbers in GBP as of Friday close-of-market in the UK; treasury figures do not yet include any proceeds from the ATM-style instrument.)\n\nIf you divide these two metrics, the result is the mNAV for the SWC treasury.  As you can see, it has compressed considerably.\n\nIt may be of interest to compare this mNAV against other companies pursuing a Bitcoin treasury strategy.  One particularly interesting comparison is Metaplanet a year ago, when its BTC treasury was a similar size to SWC’s today.\n\nIn July 2024, Metaplanet had ~300 BTC and an mNAV of ~20, at which point that premium compressed rapidly down to ~6 within a month.  The share price fell from 300 yen to 64 yen, a 79% decline.  One interesting result of that time period was that the Metaplanet community embraced the phrase “volatility is vitality” in recognition that high vol is part of successfully executing this kind of Bitcoin strategy.\n\nI shared this in the SWC community group yesterday (check it out for SWC discussions and analysis like this\nx.com/i/communities/19156736…\n).

    "text": "Hello SWC community!\n\nThank you for the very kind welcome - I'm flattered and grateful.  I'm excited to help contribute to this remarkable story that\n@asjwebley\nhas brought to life.\n\nI look forward to engaging with you all here.  For my first post, I felt a meme was in order... granted, a rather nerdy meme I made today. \n\nMy favorite painting ever is a British classic that stopped me in my tracks at the National Portrait Gallery.  \n\nAs you most likely already know, this painting is an allegory of the Industrial Revolution.  Technological progress rendered the tried-and-true methods of the past obsolete.  \n\nTrue of warships then.  True of hard money now.  \n\nIn my opinion, the sun is setting on the dominance of analog SoV assets like gold.  Meanwhile, the sun rises on the era of digital capital.\n\nMany will mourn the fading of the old, as Turner did.  But a few will embrace the new for its merits, ushering in a bright orange future.  \n\nIt's often hard to find that latter group.  But here you are.",
