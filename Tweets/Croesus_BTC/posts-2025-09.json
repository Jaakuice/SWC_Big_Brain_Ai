    "text": "For perspective,\n@smarterwebuk\nhas delivered +278% BTC Yield in Q3, yet currently trades at 1.6x mNAV (meaning, priced as if we will only deliver +60% BTC Yield forever).  \n\nThese 55 BTC were the result of our ATM-style facility running for the last 2 weeks, and only on up days.\n\nThese proceeds are nearly 2x what we generated over the prior 2 week period.  The reason: volume picked up - have people been buying the dip?\n\nThis ATM-style facility is the base layer of our capital raising strategy & the lifeblood of a healthy BTCTC.  In my personal opinion, after a harsh sector-wide mNAV compression over the last 10 weeks, this is what a vibrant BTCTC looks like. \n\nOn top of this ATM fundraising layer, we also pursue lumpier (and larger) capital raises of equity bookbuilds, Smarter Converts, and other fundraising opportunities.\n\nIt's still early days, but we are on a promising path to become the Metaplanet or Strategy for the UK.\n\n[Quoted post by @smarterwebuk: The Smarter Web Company RNS Announcement: Bitcoin Purchase.\n\nThe Smarter Web Company (AQUIS:\n#SWC\n| OTCQB:\n$TSWCF\n| FRA: $3M8), a London-listed technology company and the UK’s largest publicly traded company holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet, announces the purchase of additional Bitcoin as part of “The 10 Year Plan” which includes an ongoing treasury policy of acquiring Bitcoin. \n\nPlease read the RNS on our website:\ninvestors.smarterwebcompany.…]",
