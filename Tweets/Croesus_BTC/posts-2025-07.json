    "text": "Here are the two most compelling charts that I'm aware of in global finance.\n\nFirst, the rate of\n#Bitcoin\naccumulation by notable BTC Treasury Companies.  One sticks out.\n\nSecond, the mNAV chart for that standout.  mNAV has now compressed to ~3.4x\n\nMy thinking here...\n\nWith Bitcoin, we've seen what it looks like when an asset bootstraps itself from zero value to having lots of value.  It's an organic, free market process.  \n\nIt brings lots of volatility with it - the key is that this volatility skews to the upside (h/t:\n@riskdimensions\n), which makes it a good thing.  You welcome that vol.\n\nWhat we're seeing with BTCTCs mirrors this process.  A well-run BTCTC can go from zero value to having lots of value, specifically because it is accumulating Bitcoin rapidly.  \"The only thing better than Bitcoin is more Bitcoin.\"\n@saylor\nThis brings the same market dynamics.  The market is a machine for finding equilibrium - but when an asset is rapidly changing in its fundamental value, that introduces high uncertainty (and disagreement) about what the true value for that asset is.  Price discovery.  This means high volatility as the market seeks equilibrium, and diminishing volatility as that process plays out.\n\nBut if the asset keeps growing in underlying value, that volatility remains high.  But again, if this is volatility that on average skews to the upside, that's ultimately good.  No quality asset goes up in a straight line - only Bernie Madoff's fund does that.  So the possible outcomes an investor is always limited to: high volatility and highly negative performance, low volatility and mediocre performance, or high volatility and highly positive performance.\n\nObviously, only one of those is truly attractive.  But what does that category of assets look like?\n\nWell, take Bitcoin's history as your paragon of what good looks like.  An asset whose fundamentals get better over time, with high volatility (especially in its early days) that skews to the upside.  Growth for Bitcoin has been a series of bubbles that overextend to the upside, \"crash\", then find equilibrium at a higher price than before... only to repeat the process.\n\nIn studying BTCTCs, I see the same patterns... but on a very compressed timeframe.  Look at Metaplanet's ~15 months of history and you'll see several cycles of boom and bust - mNAV expansion and compression - meanwhile, their Bitcoin per share steadily improves.  It's not that Metaplanet's fundamentals are volatile, it's that the market's attempts to understand Metaplanet's value has been volatile.  Human sentiment is what's volatile. (h/t\n@BitcoinPierre\n)\n\nMetaplanet was the best performing public equity in the world in 2024 because their fundamentals rapidly (and steadily) improved.  They furiously added Bitcoin per share - nothing better than that!  The ensuing market volatility was to the upside, to the benefit of investors who understood the fundamentals and were able to withstand the inevitable sentiment swings in the market.\n\nWhat I find especially compelling about the two charts shown here is that you can see the steady fundamentals in one, and the volatility of market sentiment in the other.  You can even see the history of Metaplanet's fundamentals to compare against.\n\nNot financial advice - I haven't even mentioned the company from\n@BitcoinBee21\nchart.  Your eyes picked it out from the data.\n\nTo summarize, it's surprising to me at times that the market has such trouble keeping sight of fundamentals when high growth brings high volatility, which in turn brings downside price swings that rattle sentiment.\n\nMeanwhile, if you do your own research (and are comfortable with numbers), you may just find the next Metaplanet.  Happy hunting!",
