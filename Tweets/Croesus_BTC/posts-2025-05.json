    "text": "This is a land grab.  This is a gold rush.\n\nYou don't have to participate... but your descendants will wish you had.\n\nThis is the second wave of the Digital Revolution - the digitization of value to complement the Internet's digitization of information.\n\nIt wasn't possible to own a slice of the Internet itself, but it is possible with Bitcoin, the internet of value.\n\nBut what's crucial to understand about this protocol of digital value is...\n\nThere will only ever be 21M\n#Bitcoin\n.\n@Eric_BIGfund\nrecently told me that this fact was what grabbed Saylor's attention after years of dismissing Bitcoin.  Here's why...\n\nThere are 8B people on the planet.  That means that there's only ~0.0025 BTC per person.\n\nBut most of it is already accounted for.  Only 5.4% remains to be mined (~1.1M BTC).  And of the already circulating supply, probably ~16M is held by believers with no intention to sell between here and $1M/BTC.\n\nThat means ~5M BTC is still up for grabs.\n\nAnd yet, only ~0.2% of the world's $1000T of capital has shifted into Bitcoin.\n\nThat means that 1% of the world has a 20% allocation to Bitcoin... but the remaining 99% of the world still has a 0% allocation.\n\n1% of the world fighting over ~16M BTC took us from $0/BTC to $100k/BTC.  \n\nHow high will the price go as the remaining 99% of the world fights over 1/3 as much available Bitcoin?  If it's only linear, that would mean ~300x higher.\n\nMeanwhile, Saylor's bullish prediction for 20 years from now is $49M/BTC, which would be a ~500x from today.\n\nIt feels like you're late to Bitcoin.  But this is a bigger game playing out than most realize, and we are much earlier than casual observers know.  \n\nIf you're reading this, you're here on the frontier early.  And you have a chance to stake a claim before 99% of the world shows up.\n\nThis is a land grab.  This is the digital gold rush.  Make your descendants proud.",
