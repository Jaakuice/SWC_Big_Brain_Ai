    "text": "Oregon had a halving schedule.\n\nIn the early 1840s, 640 acres of prime farmland were granted to each couple who arrived via the Oregon Trail.  One square mile.\n\nIn 1850, this was decreased to 320 acres.\n\nIn 1862, this was decreased to 160 acres.\n\nThe earlier a new adopter made the journey, the better off they were.\n\nBut of course, the earlier you went, the more dangerous and challenging the journey was.\n\nThe earliest migrants attempted the journey before the Oregon Trail was navigable by covered wagon.\n\nIn 1839, 18 men set out from Illinois with a flag emblazoned with their motto “Oregon or the Grave.”  Half of these men made it to the fertile land of Oregon; half died on the journey.\n\nEach year after, more attempted the journey.  Such was the promise of a new life, and ample farmland in Oregon.\n\n“The Great Migration of 1843” brought 1,000 new settlers via wagon train.\n\nImagine how late those families felt.  All the very best farmland was taken.  \n\nInstead of 640 acres right next to the Willamette River, you might have to settle for an equally fertile plot one mile away!\n\nOf course, we can recognize that complaint as ridiculous.  It’s obvious to us that anyone in the first few thousand settlers of Oregon was extremely early.\n\nAnd guess what… that’s effectively where we’re at with Bitcoin.\n\nEveryone who arrives at the Bitcoin thesis feels late.  Everyone wishes they had stacked sats earlier.\n\nBut it’s better to remember how many people are still behind us.  \n\nBitcoin isn’t a small region like Oregon.  Bitcoin is for everyone - it is digital capital that could grow to be 50% of all the world’s asset value, according to Saylor.\n\nAnd yet, maybe 10M people on Earth understand Bitcoin as an important savings vehicle.  That’s ~0.1% of the world.\n\nSo if you’re arriving now, you’re in the first 0.2% of genuine adopters.  That means 99.8% of the world is still behind you.  And they’re on their way.\n\nYou may not feel like you’re early to Oregon… but you are.\n\nMake the most of this opportunity and your descendants will know you as the legend who changed everything for your family.",

    "text": "There's another side of corporate adoption of\n#Bitcoin\nthat we don't talk about enough. \n\nThis is GoodOnya - the organic electrolyte powder.  \n\nIt's an awesome product, owned and operated by one of my oldest friends and his design dynamo wife, and they're growing like crazy.\n\n(Check them out on Amazon, highly recommend.  They didn't ask me to write this, which is why I am.)\n\nBut what's relevant here is that they're using Bitcoin as part of their treasury strategy.\n\nFor small businesses, using Bitcoin as a treasury asset provides a unique competitive advantage.\n\nBitcoin is for everyone.  And that means it benefits every type of entity.\n\nIndividuals.  Investment funds.  Public companies.  Governments.  These are the visible ones we hear about.\n\nBut small businesses benefit from Bitcoin just as much, if not more than these other groups.  \n\nJust ask\n@TheRealTahinis\n(they originally inspired Strategy's bitcoin treasury move) who have used Bitcoin to grow to more than 60 restaurant locations in a short space of time.\n\nAs Bitcoin continues to prove itself a valuable ally for small businesses, it will increasingly become the norm for operators to keep assets in Bitcoin.  \n\nAnd that will only further normalize Bitcoin as part of the fabric of the financial landscape.\n\nUntil then, small businesses like GoodOnya, Tahini's, and thousands of others will quietly have an edge thanks to Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is for everyone.  And every balance sheet.",
