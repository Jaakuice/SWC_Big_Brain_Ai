    "text": "Sentiment has become very bearish - and with good reason.  Macro headwinds (tariffs, public sector cuts) and post-election market clarity fading.  Feels like Bitcoin could get dragged down with it, setting an unexpected premature cycle top (imo, a ~25% chance).\n\nHowever, this current gloomy sentiment could just be the latest swing in our new normal for Bitcoin.\n\nIn 2024, we spent 8 months stuck at prior ATH.  Lots of coins needed to change hands at that price level, from long-term holders (who regretted not selling the top in 2021) to new entrants (who viewed Bitcoin as headed far beyond $70k).\n\nBut that process doesn't play out linearly over time.  It takes volatility.\n\nWhen we finally hit prior-ATH ($70k) in early 2024, nobody felt like selling.  Price was moving up!  But when that momentum stalled out, then the sellers started to show up.  And once price starts going down, selling accelerates.\n\nBut selling can't be sustained either, and it gives way to relief rallies.  Which then give way to another round of selling as sentiment shifts from \"it's going higher\" to \"maybe that was the top, and I should sell before it goes lower\"\n\nIn 2024 while we were stuck going \"sideways\" at prior-ATH, there were 3 waves of selling.  Each successive wave came with greater speed and amplitude.  \n\nBy the end of the third wave, everyone who could be convinced to sell at-or-near prior-ATH had been shaken out.  The supply of potential sellers had been depleted; coins had changed hands like batons to fresh legs.  (And those fresh legs were ETFs, MicroStrategy, billionaires, and sovereign wealth funds.)\n\nAnd then we jumped up to the next psychological level: $100k.\n\nNow, we're playing out a similar process.  Coins changing hands from long-term holders to the same new cohort of buyers.\n\nThere's no guarantee that it will play out exactly as in 2024 (in fact, it most likely won't), but in broad strokes, the process could play out similarly.  \"Sideways\" with waves of volatility, until the supply of willing sellers is depleted.\n\nAs of today,\n#Bitcoin\nhas touched oversold conditions for the first time since last August (the end of the -29% crash to $49k).\n\nIf we see a relief rally and a continuation of this \"sideways\" price channel, we will look back on today as a buying opportunity.",
