    "text": "Busy week for The Smarter Web Company team. First full week back in the office after the Vegas Bitcoin 2025 conference where it was great to spend a bit of time with my fellow #SWC director @tylev . Some interesting client enquiries for web design projects and managed some coding which I always enjoy. I was slightly surprised by the market reaction to our raise. My thoughts on this is that perhaps the market is a little stunned with the size perhaps? There are some good comments online about our Bitcoin Treasury after this and in my view we are considerably stronger after completing this solid raise. Worth checking out a good summary last night from @ZynxBTC . This week we also managed to tweak our corporate colours; that needed to be done before our merch goes live on the website. We hope to have the caps available soon and are looking at designs for t-shirts and hoodies now. Watch this space! We did our best to deploy the rebrand without any glitches but the SWC Smarter Web Company BTC community picked up on it just before we had it fully rolled out! Good work by all in the community and shout out to @ourgoodlifeuk @BitcoinBee21 @andysmith_asap @the_desert_ape and all the other community members creating great content. I have had loads of great messages this week and apologies if some (many!) have not had a reply. I am focused on the mission but very grateful for everyone's kind words. If I can't reply to each comment please rest assured that I have probably read the comment and I take all feedback into account. What does the week ahead have in store for us you are probably thinking? All I can say is that we are working on all aspects of our strategy, I will aim to keep it interesting (and less predictable) and we believe that we are making excellent progress on all fronts. We are only just getting started.",

I will bring it up in one of the next interviews we do as we always get asked if there is anything I would like to add. In short though; security is critical and therefore we selected 3 major platforms at the outset which we wanted to work with. That is based on many factors but insurance / financial strength combined with security protocols are two of the most important. The approach is very similar to other public companies that have adopted Bitcoin on their balance sheet. At this stage we do not believe that self custody is a suitable option for public companies.",

    "text": "It certainly was not dull for anyone following The Smarter Web Company over the last week. In my view we had the best week to date in terms of the business itself but then we also had the worst week to date in terms of share price. We can all speculate why the disconnect and the truth is that there are probably many factors that impact this. My job is to focus on trying to build a long-term business and that is what I will do. Every day. We started the week with a direct subscription for ~£3.8 million and also a new Bristol address for the company. Tuesday saw our largest Bitcoin buy to date, with just under 200 Bitcoin added to our treasury. On Wednesday evening we announced a fundraise and on Thursday, when we announced the results, it was our largest single fundraise raising ~£41.2 million. The SWC community is growing with 2.4k members last week and 2.7k today. Healthy growth in over 10%. I have been pleased to see the support from the whole community and reassured that the quality of the analysis is broadly in line with what I see. Nick has been busy keeping the stats updated and we are grateful for all the work that he puts into that. Shout out to @ourgoodlifeuk @BitcoinBee21 @ZynxBTC @the_desert_ape @doublediamond65 @johnsthor1 I have had a lot of help from @Croesus_BTC since he has joined the team and we have a few different workstreams that we have been focusing on. He has really hit the ground running and is a pleasure to work with. With our corporate plans (and the volatility) it is helpful to have the support of @tylev who has been “around the block” a few times with Bitcoin plus also public companies adding Bitcoin to the balance sheet and his guidance is a massive help. People do not really see the others in the team who support me driving things forward; Sean, Mario, Jamie and Alex all do different roles but all are important in how they help. Our numerous advisors are also key to this. On Thursday I spent the day in London with a variety of different meetings and of course was lucky to spend some time with @saylor who was very kind to take time out of a busy schedule to talk about #SWC $TSWCF and how we grow to be a company that the UK can be proud of. Aquis (the exchange) have also been supportive and at an event they organised it was nice to speak with some different companies considering a listing in the future and to share my experience to try and help. We have now been listed for just over 2 months and whilst some will be annoyed with the recent share price for me this is a long-term mission. In my view the business is stronger at the end of the week that it was at the start and I am looking forward to next week. I hope most of you think that we are still doing okay!",

    "text": "Another busy week for The Smarter Web Company. The close this week saw #SWC as the largest company on the Aquis Stock Exchange by a significant margin. We also became a \"unicorn\" passing a £1 billion valuation for the first time. According to @hlinvest we are one of the most bought and sold global equities and we are the most bought and sold UK equity. Looking at the OTC markets website where investors can buy $TSWCF , yesterday we were one of the most liquid OTCQB stocks (number 2) so that is pleasing to also see. I spent Tuesday in London taking part in a Digital Assets event for institutional investors and then in the evening had a couple of great hours at @BitcoinSurrey where I met lots of nice people many of who told me how SWC had changed their lives. The SWC community has grown from strength to strength this week and as I type this there are 2.4k members. We could not do all this without the support of such a fantastic cohort of investors so shout out to all of you including @ourgoodlifeuk @ZynxBTC @the_desert_ape @doublediamond65 @johnsthor1 I did some interviews / livestreams with @Anders_ @Adrian_R_Morris and have more planned next week with others. Respected global investors like @Micro2Macr0 and @AdamBLiv have also been spreading the word and its humbling to see experienced people like this see what we are doing with our UK company and that they like our strategy. Sent more emails than I can keep track of from people globally wanting to invest in our stock and we are working on a number of things to try and make the access easier for people globally. So if you are in Australia, Europe, Asia or anywhere else please rest assured that we are working on solutions and will share this when we can. Honoured to be able to announce this week that @Croesus_BTC joined the team. Jesse is a hard working, intelligent, respected and experienced individual who many of you know and will really help us drive the company forward. Over the coming weeks you will see him online both with and without me talking about what we are doing and where we are heading. We are lucky to have the support of some great friends and colleagues so shout out also to @tylev and @DavidFBailey . News wise we also updated the market on getting to 346.63 Bitcoin and now my initial personal target of 1,000 Bitcoin, within 4 months, seems very achievable. @BitcoinBee21 has done a great job as always of keeping the stats updated as the news has been released. We also announced a facility for 21 million shares which we had been working on for a short while with our advisors and from the comments I have seen everyone seems to agree with me that this is a sensible approach to grow the business. Thanks to our supportive broker @Tennyson_Secs for helping us with so much. Yesterday I got the long awaited sample of the SWC cap and I am hoping that the hoodies and t-shirts are only another week or so away from being available for investors to order. The cap is very good although there is one change that I am going to make to it before I order the first batch of these to be made. Hoodies and t-shirts will be available on the website first. Caps to then follow. And all this was within the first 2 months of being a listed business, so we really are only just getting started (and yes I still think that we are doing okay).",

    "text": "What a week it has been for The Smarter Web Company! At the close on Friday we have become the largest stock by market cap on the Aquis Stock Exchange and during the week our shares started trading on the OTCQB market $TSWCF allowing retail investors in the US better access. After the UK market closed on Friday we announced a fundraise aiming to raise a minimum of £15 million and the results of this fundraise will be published around 07:00 on Monday 16 June. I managed to get some media slotted in and enjoyed speaking with @TimKotzman and @ourgoodlifeuk . Both of these videos are online and can be viewed now. I loved seeing the video from @AdamBLiv who gets the company better than most and I was blown away by the detail in his video understanding every little aspect with precision. Hearing @Micro2Macr0 talk about #SWC on YouTube was also amazing for me and another cool thing to see. This coming week I am talking at a few events so a busy day in London on Tuesday with an institutional investor conference and then in the evening with @BitcoinSurrey which should be a lot of fun. At the conference I want to speak to those that have supported us to date and then also those that are thinking of supporting us in the future. So grateful to have the support of our original backers @DavidFBailey and @tylev and Tyler and I have had numerous chats this week on some quite exciting things for The Smarter Web Company that we are working on. Watch this space! The SWC community is growing at a pretty impressive rate and currently has over 1,300 members. Two days ago this was around 1,000. There is so much great content being posted within the community by everyone including @ourgoodlifeuk @BitcoinBee21 @andysmith_asap @the_desert_ape @doublediamond65 @johnsthor1 . @HenryBTCchef has organised a meal with an impressive menu for investors in September and that is another thing to look forward to. I think the tickets sold out pretty quick and if you are going then looking forward to meeting you. Maybe we need to speak to him and see if he can organise a much bigger event so more can join on another occasion? We managed to get the SWC merch ordered so I am hoping in around 2 weeks that will be listed on the site. An update would not be complete without mentioning @BitcoinBee21 for the amazing tools he has developed and @ZynxBTC for his independent opinions. I enjoy his weekly summary as each week ends. This week one of my best moments which has been repeated multiple times has been messages from people where SWC has made a difference to their world. Everything from weddings paid for, holidays booked, cars bought, jobs given up, mortgages paid off. That is an awesome thing for me to be part of in my small way. I am sure that I have failed to list numerous things from the week that has just passed - lots of the things that I do during the week whether it is operational matters, corporate matters, meeting with people that want to support us or just trying to think about what people can make a difference to the business probably go unnoticed but please keep in mind that we have a mission and if I am quiet that is because I am working on that. As usual my weekend is half catching up and half chilling out. I am ready to go again already and will be even more ready come Monday morning! It's a lot of fun but remember that we are only just getting started.",

    "text": "We are just about to order The Smarter Web Company #SWC hoodies and t-shirts. The caps are on the way as we had a slight delay in the production so I imagine that all merch will be on the website around the same time. Maybe three weeks from now. Sorry this has taken a little time but we are focused on the business strategy and this is a bit of fun around the edges of that! With my focus on cost I am thinking that we get all three t-shirt designs made and they will probably cost about £20 including UK delivery and then £25 with worldwide delivery. Then on the hoodies they will likely be £40 with UK delivery and £45 with worldwide delivery, but we are initially only going to get one of the three designs made. I am keen to charge to cover the cost as I think that is in the best interest of the company (with our stated strategy). Prices are not fixed at this stage, I am just being transparent as we get close to having them ready. On the hoodies please vote for your favourite design and for the first batch we will get the one with the most votes made. Community votes will really help me with this and poll being posted next....",
