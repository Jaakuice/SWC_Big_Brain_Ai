    "text": "Another week has flown by, which means it’s time for The Smarter Web Company weekly update ( #SWC $TSWCF $3M8.F). I started the week by arriving in Singapore on Monday, where I have been until yesterday. The purpose of the Singapore trip was: existing and potential investor meetings, visiting and presenting at @Token2049 and catching up with others in the industry on a variety of subjects. @Croesus_BTC was conducting the online media appearances for the both of us this week and he started the week on @RoxomTV for a catch up with @borjamartels . On Wednesday we announced the appointment of Randal Casson, a new Non-Executive Director. Randal is also a Non-Executive Director at the FTSE 100 company, Games Workshop Group PLC and before this he was an audit partner at PwC. His significant experience will be valuable to our mission with specific reference to corporate governance, controls and audits. On Wednesday I also took part in a panel at @Token2049 . Unsurprisingly this was about Digital Asset Treasuries and it was good to see how advanced we are with Bitcoin Treasury companies and how these other companies can learn from us in terms of capital structure, metrics and investor communications. It does not really matter if you believe in the assets they have selected, it is still interesting to see how they adopt the model. The rest of Wednesday was spent meeting different people and media commitments. Then a few hours in the hotel room catching up on emails. Thursday was a similar format to Wednesday with a panel discussion with @Cointelegraph to end the day. Shortly after I did the panel, which was streamed live, @Croesus_BTC was back online with @ourgoodlifeuk and I can recommend watching this stream as it was a good one (you can find it on my timeline). On Friday I had several investor meetings with the last of these starting at 17:00. After this it was a taxi to the airport for the 23:00 plane and back to the UK. I am currently about 2 hours away from landing as I post this. As always, I must give a shout out to the SWC community on X. We are close to 4,500 members in the community now and it will be interesting to see how this grows from here. Shout out to: @andysmith_asap @johnsthor1 @JohnCoo70815409 @80IQConviction @doublediamond65 @Michaeljdobbin @Boutiquecapital @InvestorSmarter @DrBitcoinM50862 @the_desert_ape @ZynxBTC @ourgoodlifeuk @AFCB12 and @BitcoinBee21 . Special shout out to @andysmith_asap who made the trip over to Singapore: it’s a pleasure to spend time with you. With a shorter update this week, perhaps it feels like we have achieved less than in previous weeks? In my view we end the week better than where we started. As always, I am grateful for the support.",

    "text": "Enjoyed the @saylor & @MicroStrategy earnings call. Two things stood out (and one I've already had a few DMs about): 1. Time horizons. Investing is a long game. Trading is a short game. Most can succeed with investing - few with trading. Strategy is positioning prefs as a short-term vehicle for many, but it's key to understand the difference between investor types and what investors want. Some want the shorter-term upside of equity, even with volatility - and that same volatility is a large part of what allows a Bitcoin Treasury company to generate yield when using equity as a tool. Worth remembering. 2. International prefs. Strategy launching prefs globally is a huge positive. More regions. More competition. More investor choice. That means a bigger market - and more momentum for Bitcoin. Good companies competing improve things. When I listed my business, everyone said it couldn’t be done. Turns out, if you believe in something and try, it can be done. I wake up more bullish every day - on Bitcoin, on Bitcoin Treasury companies, and on what’s coming next. Today's no exception.",

    "text": "It has been another busy week at The Smarter Web Company (AQUIS: #SWC | OTCQB: $TSWCF | FRA: $3M8), despite a disappointing share price. I have been investing in Bitcoin Treasury companies for over 5 years – until last year this has meant @MicroStrategy - and in Bitcoin itself for almost 10 years. Volatility does not bother me, in fact I love it as it is the mechanism that gives outsized performance, but as the CEO of a public company adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet, I do feel for shareholders new to the space. I have zero doubt in the Bitcoin Treasury companies that I hold and the largest shareholding I have is SWC shares. We are currently trading at approximately the value of our Bitcoin holdings using the fully diluted shares in issue calculation (a 1.00 mNAV) and as discussed repeatedly maybe this is the wrong way for the market to price a company like ours. Time will tell but that is certainly my opinion. We started the week with an update on the Subscription Agreement (ATM style facility) where we have raised an additional £1.2m (before expenses). This is a lower total than our partner could have obtained over that period, but I have been pleased with them looking at the balance between generating capital and believing in the value of our equity and I hope that they continue with this approach. I believe they will! On Monday it was also my turn to join @RoxomTV for the weekly show where we update everyone on the latest developments. @Croesus_BTC and I rotate appearing so we do the show every other week although sometimes we will also appear together. Finally on Monday we put the new @smarterwebuk Bitcoin Treasury Analytics dashboard live so if you have not yet looked at that please visit our website to check that out. On Tuesday we updated the market with a small Bitcoin buy. Only 10 Bitcoin but this now takes the total to 2,660 and shows our quarter-to-date Bitcoin yield at 1.7% a number that we aim to improve in the remining 2 months we have within this quarter. Later in the day on Tuesday I joined @TimKotzman for the Bitcoin Treasuries Digital Conference. It was great to speak with him and earlier during the conference @MadBitcoin_ announced a new event starting May 2026 in Madrid, bringing a Bitcoin conference to Spain. I am going and so far, they have put together a good line up of speakers. One of the many challenges we face now that we have grown to be a little larger is how we can allocate time to the various events that take place globally. We must be careful with the time that we allocate as our focus is growing the business and improving Bitcoin Yield. Therefore, we cannot attend all events and prioritise as best we can. Wednesday saw @Croesus_BTC catch up with @Anders_ and I travelled to London in the evening to talk at an entrepreneurs evening with @juliusbaer . I met some lovely people, and it was nice to hear different stories whilst sharing some of the things we have learnt since becoming a public company. On the train home I listened to the recording of Jesse and Anders and as always, they were great. The rest of the week was spent working with the internal team and our external advisers on a variety of different things. As always, the SWC community deserve a shout out. Thank you to: @andysmith_asap @johnsthor1 @JohnCoo70815409 @80IQConviction @doublediamond65 @matthewkerridge @Michaeljdobbin @Boutiquecapital @InvestorSmarter @DrBitcoinM50862 @the_desert_ape @ZynxBTC @ourgoodlifeuk @AFCB12 and @BitcoinBee21 . A special shout out to @HenryBTCchef . I was on a call on Wednesday (with our legal team) and a delivery of bread arrived; the best bread from the Southwest of England. A very kind and unexpected delivery. I look forward to the next time that we do an event together and I still have the 12-month IPO anniversary in mind for when that would work well. Now a request. On Wednesday 19 November 2025 I have been invited by Aquis to talk at their annual Aquis Showcase being held at the Royal College of Surgeons of England (London). The link for tickets is in the comments and if you use the code AQSE25 you can get 25% off the ticket price (£27.80 before the discount). On the day they have a vote for the best listed company on Aquis, and I would hope that given what we have achieved, so far, in 2025 we have a good chance. If anyone is in London and able to attend the day then all additional votes would be appreciated! I appreciate that for some shareholders the price action maybe disappointing. We are laser focused on the mission, and we are delivering Bitcoin yield - even in the tougher times. To become the largest company in the UK, which is my goal, it will not be a straight line, but we are confident in our strategy and determined to advance. Myself and my team greatly appreciate your support.",

    "text": "A tough week for The Smarter Web Company in fiat terms (AQUIS: #SWC | OTCQB: $TSWCF | FRA: $3M8). In Bitcoin terms a slight improvement given that our Bitcoin per share is higher than where it was at the start of the week. I look at various metrics when I look at Bitcoin Treasury companies but two of the metrics I focus on most for SWC are mNAV and BTC Yield. I have lost count of the discussions I have had about the benefits of compound Bitcoin but for me BTC Yield is incredibly important. Assuming that the BTC Yield can be delivered into the future of course. At present, our shares trade at approximately 1x fully diluted mNAV, meaning the market is valuing the company almost entirely on our existing Bitcoin holdings, with no premium for our execution or future growth prospects. While the market may currently ascribe zero premium to this potential, a key focus as a management team is on generating BTC Yield. Even small, compounding increases in Bitcoin per share translate directly into long-term shareholder value, particularly in a world where Bitcoin itself is a finite and appreciating asset. I find our current market valuation frustrating, as I believe we have executed well across most fronts over the past six months. I understand that recent volatility may be unsettling for some shareholders, and I share that frustration. That said, I remain entirely undeterred. As a Bitcoin investor for almost 10 years I am fairly used to these choppy waters and if anything, this only strengthens my resolve to keep pushing forward. I am confident that, in time, the market will recognise the true value we are building. We had just one announcement during the week. This was on Monday when we announced 100 Bitcoin added, taking our Bitcoin holdings to 2,650. Our Bitcoin yield quarter-to-date is now showing 0.58%. However soon when our new analytics engine update goes live all numbers will be reported using fully diluted numbers and using this the quarter-to-date yield would show 1.66%. Thank you @RoaringRagnar for your comments around this. On Monday @Croesus_BTC also caught up with @RoxomTV . On Wednesday I spent the day in London at a Coinbase institutional event. This was an opportunity to meet face to face with several institutional investors we’ve been speaking to over the past few months. There were several good speakers and although personally I am apolitical, I enjoyed listening to Sir Nick Clegg (Former UK Deputy Prime Minister) and George Osborne (Former UK Chancellor of the Exchequer) discuss crypto plus various government policies. When I was in London @Croesus_BTC joined @rkbaggs and @gazza_jenks to talk about the market sentiment in Bitcoin Treasury companies. On Thursday I managed to catch the second half of @the_desert_ape and @ZynxBTC chatting with @ourgoodlifeuk . Each of these individuals have been great supporters of SWC since we went public and I am grateful for their continued support. Of course, we must give a shout out to the SWC community on X. Especially in a week that has tested people’s conviction. Shout out to: @andysmith_asap @johnsthor1 @JohnCoo70815409 @80IQConviction @doublediamond65 @matthewkerridge @Michaeljdobbin @Boutiquecapital @InvestorSmarter @DrBitcoinM50862 @the_desert_ape @ZynxBTC @ourgoodlifeuk @AFCB12 and @BitcoinBee21 . Although not strictly speaking the SWC X community I also want to give a mention to Patrick who is one of our longest serving shareholders. I appreciate your kind message yesterday and agree that we are still only just getting started. Friday was another busy day, filled with back-to-back meetings, before I attended a Bristol business lunch with around 30 attendees organised by Christian. It was a great way to spend a few hours connecting with local business leaders. Most were supportive and I think interested in the SWC story although almost all not yet ready to start putting Bitcoin on their balance sheets - \"yet\" being the key word here. Throughout the week, I’ve been working across the usual range of priorities - including one project in particular that’s been taking up a significant amount of time and focus. We’re looking forward to sharing more details on that soon. Most importantly, I genuinely believe we’re making solid progress on all fronts, even if the current market price doesn’t fully reflect that. As always, the entire team and I greatly appreciate your continued support.",

    "text": "I’ve seen a lot of comments online recently, and I want to make one thing clear: Bitcoin is doing just fine. It’s only about 10% below its all-time high. Bitcoin treasury companies, however, are facing a tougher market - including The Smarter Web Company (AQUIS: #SWC | OTCQB: $TSWCF | FRA: $3M8). But I believe we’re getting stronger every day, every week. There are several reasons for this divergence. At SWC, we’ve always focused on making the right long-term decisions for the benefit of the company and therefore our shareholders. Looking ahead, I’m convinced that Bitcoin treasury companies will become some of the most valuable businesses in the world. But like Bitcoin itself, the journey will include both periods of excitement and times of market depression. I deeply appreciate the continued support of our investors - and we’ll keep working to build lasting value for the long term.",

    "text": "This is a very interesting observation that may surprise many. Your figure looks like it is using the fully diluted number (i.e. including the Pre-IPO warrants). If you do this calculation without those warrants you get 0.58% Bitcoin yield quarter-to-date and if you do it with the warrants included you get around 1.66% Bitcoin yield quarter-to-date. Our new analytics dashboard (several weeks away from being live) will allow people to select from diluted or fully diluted to view all the analytics.",

    "text": "Thank you. The yield is correct (0.1%). When you generate new capital, e.g. from selling equity, you increase the number of shares in issue which is used in the calculation. The yield is the change in Bitcoin per share between two points. However there are other things you can do which would increase the Bitcoin per share without increasing the number of shares but this would change other variables, e.g. debt levels. This is why a management team need to look at the whole range of different capital tools in the tool box. Hope that makes sense.",

    "text": "Welcome to the weekly summary for The Smarter Web Company (AQUIS: #SWC | OTCQB: $TSWCF | FRA: $3M8). First, a quick note on the overnight Bitcoin price action. Over the past six months since SWC went public, many people have asked me about potential Bitcoin drawdowns. My consistent view has been that we are unlikely to see the kind of extreme crashes witnessed in earlier cycles - because Bitcoin today is a fundamentally different asset class. Overnight, Bitcoin briefly touched approximately $105,000, after trading above $120,000 for most of Friday. It’s currently around $112,500 (which is above SWC’s average purchase price). According to various market data, this move triggered the largest liquidation event in Bitcoin’s history - roughly 20 times greater than the 2020 Covid crash. In my view, the sheer scale of these liquidations - and the market’s ability to absorb them - demonstrates just how mature and resilient Bitcoin has become. Price movements will always impact investors differently, but personally I’m pleased to see how Bitcoin is becoming the asset class most of us believe it to be. On Monday we had two announcements. Firstly, the regular update on our Subscription Agreement (ATM style facility) where we have raised an additional £2.6m (before expenses). The average share price obtained for the stock was £1.02 so in my opinion beneficial to the company. On Monday we also announced a placing at £1.00 per share for an additional £9.7m (before expenses). This included a subscription for £8m from a single new US institution. Raising capital is tough at the moment, and we did this placing at no discount to the market price, by offering the new investors warrants at a 50% premium, and I think it was a good fund raising for all parties including most importantly our existing shareholders. We are thankful for the work that the @MaximGrp team has put into supporting us so far and we are always appreciative for the advice from our UK broker @Tennyson_Secs . I do also have to give a shout out to our excellent lawyers @SWLawNews and @HillDickinson alongside our lovely adviser @Strand_Hanson . The whole team of advisers worked hard on this deal, and I apologise for keeping everyone up into the early hours on Sunday night / Monday morning to get it all signed. On Monday I also caught up with @borjamartels on @RoxomTV . Bora has been a great supporter of our company, and I am hoping to drop into their London studio soon to do something in person. Tuesday saw a small Bitcoin buy announced. After this buy of 25 Bitcoin we now hold 2,550 Bitcoin. The new quarter is now upon us, so the Quarter-to-Date BTC Yield has reset to 0% and we are now just off the starting blocks at 0.1%. Bitcoin yield is a result of the management team’s appetite and ability to take on new capital structured as they see best for the business and it one of our main focuses in assessing our performance. What is an acceptable level of Bitcoin yield that a Bitcoin Treasury company should generate? I have my ideas, and I think that will be something that we all talk about more in the future. I would certainly suggest that when people look at Bitcoin Treasury companies that they focus on Quarter-to-Date BTC Yield. On Tuesday I joined @TheBitcoin__ . The last time we talked on camera was in person in Hong Kong and the market has certainly become harder since then. Markets go through periods of pain and joy and it’s all part of the market cycles. With Bitcoin and Bitcoin Treasury companies you do have to accept the volatility for the potential performance. @TheBitcoin__ is without doubt one of the nicest people in the Bitcoin community and a pleasure to chat to. On Wednesday I was invited to talk with @AlexandreLaizet from @_ALCPB and that was an enjoyable discussion. Alex is someone who I believe understands the Bitcoin Treasury model better than most and I am enjoying our current “battle” for Bitcoin held on the @BTCtreasuries leader board. Now they are winning (again) but Alex, I have you firmly in my sights! On Thursday I caught up with @ourgoodlifeuk from the SWC X community and after this livestream a few people said that I came across as a little under pressure and tired. Correct on both! When you care greatly about what you are doing, and you aim to deliver value for your shareholders, it can be tough when you are pushing every single day and making progress without the market giving you credit. However, that is the job and as an entrepreneur for over 15 years it’s something I am used to and we keep pushing to capture every opportunity. The SWC X community is now over 4,500 members and it’s always great to see the ideas and support. Shout out to: @andysmith_asap @johnsthor1 @JohnCoo70815409 @80IQConviction @doublediamond65 @Michaeljdobbin @Boutiquecapital @InvestorSmarter @DrBitcoinM50862 @the_desert_ape @ZynxBTC @ourgoodlifeuk @AFCB12 and @BitcoinBee21 . @BitcoinBee21 I think that you may need to get your orange pen out very soon and add some more dots to the Webley Tracker! Within the operating business this week we have started the rebrand project which includes the redesign of our websites. We have also been further rolling out some of our new marketing initiatives, aimed at organically growing the web design business. Please note that the rebrand will take time – months not weeks! A special shout out to @LauraStH1991 @lh_smarterwebuk and @aw_smarterwebuk for all the work in the operating business which I care about deeply but have limited time to help with. Please do not forget that if you need help with a web design project then our team would love to help. Next week should be another busy week. I have the usual mix of different things and then on Wednesday I am heading to London as Coinbase have invited me to speak at an exclusive event that they are holding. There are several well-known political figures attending along with some great industry names. I have asked them if they are recording it for those not invited and they have said they are, and it should be out a day or so after. I will share that when it is available. Please rest assured that our whole team is focused on the mission ahead of us and we believe that we have the right strategy to deliver the plan. I appreciate your support greatly.",
