    "text": "We are proud to be the UK's largest listed Bitcoin treasury company, operating with a digital balance sheet built on pristine capital and a real, revenue-generating business. That combination - operational substance plus treasury strength - we believe will prove to be a major competitive advantage as the Bitcoin treasury market evolves in 2026. Every week that passes allows Bitcoin to continue developing into its role as the world’s premier digital capital, and in the short term I am equally energised. Momentum is building - not just structurally for the long haul, but right now, in the near-term price action and liquidity. The long-term story is powerful, but the short-term potential excites me just as much. Equally encouraging has been the unwavering support from our shareholders and wider community. Following outstanding engagement at our recent General Meeting this week, it is clear our investors understand the long-term vision we are building towards. Your belief in the business, the model, and the path ahead is something we do not take for granted. As we move forward our strategy will evolve, in line with our stated 10-year plan, and we have numerous options over the short, medium and longer term. I have always said that we need to take the right steps at the right time, and I am grateful to be able to learn from other companies that are trying different things so that we can also adapt based on what others do well. As a sector I believe Bitcoin treasury companies will become the most valuable sector in the world. With some of the most valuable companies in the world leading the sector forward. I am proud to play a part in this with what we are doing with SWC. We started the week with an update on our ATM style subscription agreement. No shares were placed in the preceding two weeks as we have been trading below a 1 mNAV. When the market values the company at less than its underlying assets it makes no sense to sell equity. @Croesus_BTC has been working on a slide for our investor deck which shows how this mNAV compression links into market sentiment to help us explain this to both retail and institutional investors as we move forward. Tuesday was a humbling day for me. We had the General Meeting and both resolutions were passed with 99% of votes in favour. It was incredible to see a good number of shareholders attend and I enjoyed speaking with as many of you as I could. After the formal business, I did a presentation which @aw_smarterwebuk filmed so we could make it available to those that could not attend and @LauraStH1991 organised everything for the event with precision. After the meeting a few of us went for lunch at one of my favourite places – Mollies in Bristol – who looked after us all well and it was nice to chat to many of you who could also join that. Thanks to @wildgoosejon for organising the lunch. For the rest of the week, I was back at my desk working on a variety of things and I am still amazed that many of the forms we must complete as a public company seem to have a further ten forms to support the original form. There is a lot of administrative work that goes into a public company and most of it is in place for the right reasons. I caught up with @Anders_ on Wednesday, and he has been a solid supporter of SWC and someone that I respect immensely. @Anders_ your merch is now making its way over to LA and if you can share a photo when it arrives, I am sure that our community would be pleased to see that. On Thursday, @Croesus_BTC joined @ourgoodlifeuk from the SWC community, and in my view, it was one of the best SWC videos we’ve taken part in for some time. It was fantastic to see James looking so well, and Jesse, as ever, answered every question with the depth, professionalism and expertise we all expect from him. On Thursday I also spoke with someone who has been a little critical of SWC over the past seven months. We had a constructive conversation for over an hour, and although he’s still not convinced by the value of a Bitcoin balance sheet, I think he now has a clearer sense of what we’re trying to build. It’s a reminder that when we disagree, the best thing we can do is engage. We each see the world through our own lens, and respectful differences in opinion - when explored through open dialogue - are often what move progress forward. During the week I had a solid five minutes of laughing when I saw the “limited edition @asjwebley figure” that @DivBy21 created and shared online. The creativity in this community never ceases to impress me. Shareholder support means a lot, and some of the things our community produce are pure class. If anyone else wants a laugh you can find that on my timeline. The SWC community is very much part of our wider team, and judging by this week’s posts, they’re just as excited for the future as I am. Thank you to: @andysmith_asap @johnsthor1 @JohnCoo70815409 @80IQConviction @doublediamond65 @Toffeebdm @matthewkerridge @Michaeljdobbin @Boutiquecapital @mattoshi21 @TuftyRaul @BitcoinPlebUK @Morpheus_DX @bitcoin_philos @jay_dee_ex @CloughsStuff @InvestorSmarter @DrBitcoinM50862 @the_desert_ape @jorddd_ @ZynxBTC @wildgoosejon @SmarterBuildBTC @ourgoodlifeuk @AFCB12 @levyuk @butler_np @Raj_Devsi @Frank54703905 @SmarterBuildBTC @DivBy21 @BitcoinBee21 and @smarter_dash . Next week our community have also organised an unofficial SWC Christmas drinks meet up so I look forward to meeting many of you then – many again and some for first time. It is hard for me to say too much about what I hope to be able to announce in the near future, but our new website is now complete and in the sign off stage which should mean that it will go live very soon. This refreshed identity is designed to position The Smarter Web Company at the forefront of a new generation of companies building through the adoption of a Bitcoin balance sheet. Some initiatives simply take time to surface publicly, and as always, we remain committed to building SWC into the company that I hope we can become. I appreciate the support and hope that you all have good weekends. AQUIS: #SWC | OTCQB: $TSWCF | FRA: $3M8",

    "text": "This is my final weekly update of 2025. Since The Smarter Web Company IPO, I have written more than 30 of these weekly updates, making this a natural point to reflect on the progress achieved in our first 8 months as a public company. We were confident when we prepared for our IPO in April. Nevertheless, the momentum we have generated in the eight months since then has exceeded what many had anticipated at the time of admission. Some brief highlights: *Share price up ~13.6x (assuming 34p). Making The Smarter Web Company the best-performing stock in the UK this year *2,664 Bitcoin now held on our balance sheet *A Bitcoin Yield of 71,926% since our IPO *Largest public Bitcoin holder in the UK and 30th globally ( @BTCTreasuries ) *The third-largest Bitcoin treasury community on X globally *The most traded stock ever on the Aquis Exchange; additionally with three different global markets and millions of pounds traded daily *The creation of an efficient ATM style facility and the UKs first Bitcoin denominated convertible bond *Growing global recognition and support; including from the UKs traditional media who have been less supportive of Bitcoin over the years This has not been an easy year for Bitcoin. In GBP terms, Bitcoin is down ~13% year-to-date, and price action has not unfolded as many expected. Sentiment has been volatile, particularly within the treasury sector, with meaningful drawdowns from the Q2/Q3 highs. This context makes it even more important to step back and recognise what has been built and not to measure progress solely based on the single metric that is share price. This year was about creating a strong, structural foundation and everything we’ve accomplished in 2025 has laid the groundwork for 2026. Whilst H2 was challenging, we are well positioned. Our deliberately low headcount, combined with a real operating business that we intend to continue scaling, gives us the flexibility and ability to be patient. This remains a key differentiator for The Smarter Web Company. I mentioned last week that my weekly updates may have felt slightly repetitive without the ability to share specific details. Behind the scenes, we are working on several critical projects, and this week we’ve taken further meaningful steps toward getting them complete and into a position where we can communicate them (at the right time). Each week I ask myself one simple question: have we moved forward this week? I’m confident that we have. As I say often, none of this would have been possible without the support of many people: The Smarter Web Company team, our professional advisers and commercial partners, and most importantly our shareholders and community. The strength and loyalty of this community is one of the things I am most proud of. And I look forward to engaging even more as we continue to broaden our investor base. Shout out to: @andysmith_asap @johnsthor1 @JohnCoo70815409 @80IQConviction @HenryBTCchef @doublediamond65 @Toffeebdm @matthewkerridge @Michaeljdobbin @Boutiquecapital @mattoshi21 @TuftyRaul @BitcoinPlebUK @Morpheus_DX @bitcoin_philos @jay_dee_ex @CloughsStuff @InvestorSmarter @DrBitcoinM50862 @the_desert_ape @jorddd_ @ZynxBTC @wildgoosejon @SmarterBuildBTC @ourgoodlifeuk @AFCB12 @levyuk @butler_np @Raj_Devsi @Frank54703905 @SmarterBuildBTC @DivBy21 @BitcoinBee21 and @smarter_dash . Finally, it’s worth remembering that we are only 8 months into a 10-year plan. At times the journey will feel fast and straightforward, and at other times, slower and more challenging. What motivates us is the mission: to give investors access to a company with a real operating business and a successful Bitcoin treasury strategy, with the long-term goal of growing Bitcoin per share. We want to build something that we, our shareholders, and the UK can be proud of. I hope everyone manages to get some well-deserved rest over the Christmas and new year period. With only 3 more working days in 2025, I look forward to starting 2026 in the strongest possible position. Onwards and upwards, together. AQUIS: #SWC | OTCQB: $TSWCF | FRA: $3M8",

    "text": "As we approach the end of the year, sentiment around Bitcoin feels increasingly polarised. Some, me included, believe Bitcoin could soon move decisively beyond $100,000 on its way to new highs. Others appear close to giving up altogether. If there is one lesson markets - and Bitcoin in particular - have taught me, it is that markets have a habit of surprising most. When an outcome feels certain, it rarely plays out as expected. Short-term price movements can be entertaining to predict, but very few participants get them right with consistency. That is precisely why we adopted a Bitcoin treasury policy that does not attempt to time the market. We simply acquire Bitcoin, regardless of price, and hold it for the long term. This approach is designed to allow our balance sheet to compound over time while supporting the growth of the underlying business. I remain of the view that Bitcoin will shortly resume its long-term upward trajectory, and that the price action of recent months represents a healthy correction rather than a structural change in the thesis. The Smarter Web Company’s strategy has been deliberately designed to operate across different market environments. While our share price has been under pressure, the business itself continues to strengthen, week by week, and our confidence in the future of the strategy has not wavered. Of course, I am disappointed that our current mNAV sits below 1. However, I believe the measures we are putting in place will lead to a more favourable market assessment over time, particularly as Bitcoin sentiment improves. I have seen commentary suggesting alternative treasury strategies. From the outset, we have been clear: we hold Bitcoin, and Bitcoin only. While we retain cash for working capital purposes, I have no intention of allocating capital to any other asset. That policy remains firm and non-negotiable. On Monday we announced an update for our ATM style facility. No shares were sold in the preceding two weeks, and we made a commitment to report weekly from this point. But only when shares have been sold. That feels like the right thing to do as it gives our shareholders more visibility and when our mNAV returns to +1 we can then benefit from the proceeds weekly. @Croesus_BTC also joined @RoxomTV for “The State of Bitcoin Markets” show. I received some great comments about the show and Jesse is not only popular with all our investors, but he is also valued by the whole team at The Smarter Web Company. The rest of the week has been more intense for our team than recent weeks and I want to give a shout out to them all. The effort that you all put into the company is exceptional and I am lucky to work with you all. I would like to thank you for everything that you have done this year and remember that we are only just getting started. I feel that my weekly updates are becoming slightly repetitive in telling everyone how busy we are without some specific details. A public company has certain rules, and these exist for valid reasons. We have one critical project and several other important projects and in the not-too-distant future these will all be shared; however, they will only be announced at the right moment. One of the hardest parts of being the CEO of a public company is seeing our community and not being able to engage with them as freely as you would if you were a private company. So an extra special shout out to the whole SWC community: @andysmith_asap @johnsthor1 @JohnCoo70815409 @80IQConviction @HenryBTCchef @doublediamond65 @Toffeebdm @matthewkerridge @Michaeljdobbin @Boutiquecapital @mattoshi21 @TuftyRaul @BitcoinPlebUK @Morpheus_DX @bitcoin_philos @jay_dee_ex @CloughsStuff @InvestorSmarter @DrBitcoinM50862 @the_desert_ape @jorddd_ @ZynxBTC @wildgoosejon @SmarterBuildBTC @ourgoodlifeuk @AFCB12 @levyuk @butler_np @Raj_Devsi @Frank54703905 @SmarterBuildBTC @DivBy21 @BitcoinBee21 and @smarter_dash . Next week will be a shorter working week, and I am very much looking forward to spending a few days with my family. I will be stepping away from work on the afternoon of Christmas Eve, and in the UK, we also have Boxing Day. My family have been supportive and understanding of the time that I have put into the company this year and so a rare shout out to Jo and the kids for all their support. I will, of course, publish my usual update on Saturday next week, although please expect it to be slightly shorter than normal. I would like to take this opportunity to wish you all a very happy Christmas and a prosperous New Year. At The Smarter Web Company, we have built a strong business on the foundation of a pristine Bitcoin balance sheet, and we are excited about what 2026 may bring.

    "text": "By recent standards, Bitcoin has continued to be reassuringly volatile. What matters most is the trend beneath the noise, and from my perspective Bitcoin is looking healthy and more importantly steadily asserting its position in the global financial landscape. Volatility allows strong treasury strategies to thrive and Bitcoin underpinning the world’s financial system is where I think we are heading. For The Smarter Web Company, the backdrop remains exceptionally compelling. Our combination of a robust balance sheet, disciplined operations, a real revenue engine and a solid strategy place us in a uniquely strong position in the UK as we head toward 2026. Each week reinforces why being the UK's largest listed Bitcoin treasury company is more than a headline - it’s a strategic advantage. The market is evolving quickly, and we are positioned not just to participate in that evolution, but to lead it. Over the past few weeks, there has been a noticeable increase in debate around the Bitcoin treasury company model. This feels very similar to the early years of the Bitcoin treasury model, when it was just @microStrategy . Back then many questioned its viability as a balance sheet component – or what we now call digital capital. I have no doubt today that Bitcoin fulfils that role better than any other asset. What we are now seeing is a natural evolution: different companies will take different approaches, at different speeds, but the general path for many will likely mirror the one already demonstrated by @microStrategy . Each adopting only the elements that work for their specific situation over time. For us, that means a sequence of tools used in the right order and at the right time: first equity, then we introduced an ATM style programme, and in the future potentially debt or preferred equity. Perhaps alongside additional mechanisms as markets and regulations mature and evolve. The important point is that no single structure is “the model”. Different instruments are appropriate for different companies depending on their size, jurisdiction, and stage of development. Please remember that just as Bitcoin has evolved into digital capital, attitudes to Bitcoin companies and associated regulations will evolve and this is a multi-year, multi-decade, mission which takes patience. My commitment to our investors is simple: I am focused on growing The Smarter Web Company into one of the largest companies in the UK. I will not get every decision perfect, but I will aim to get most of them right and to take each step with discipline and timing. I have a clear vision, and I remain confident that the strategy we are executing is the correct one. This week we have had just one regulatory announcement. On Thursday we announced our updated corporate website. Alongside enhanced investor relations content, the site showcases the core operating business: delivering high-quality website solutions to clients across the UK and internationally. As part of this website launch, we are also relaunching The Smarter Web Company brand – signalling our ambition to lead the UK market as a business that has successfully leveraged digital capital to accelerate growth in our core operating activities while simultaneously building long-term value through a Bitcoin treasury. This refreshed identity is designed to position The Smarter Web Company at the forefront of a new generation of public companies that appeals to both retail and institutional investors: a company that seeks to scale sustainably, responsibly manage a treasury in Bitcoin, and combine commercial execution with Bitcoin stewardship. We believe this approach places The Smarter Web Company in a strong position within the UK public markets as we continue to grow our operating business, increase our Bitcoin holdings and aim to create long-term value for our shareholders. On Friday I joined some of our investors for the unofficial The Smarter Web Company Christmas drinks. The gathering was held in Bristol, and it was fantastic to see so many of you in person, some for the first time and others whom I’ve come to know over the past year. Thank you to @80IQConviction for organising the meetup. The atmosphere was relaxed, energetic and positive - a reflection, I think, of the momentum we’ve built together and the shared belief in what we’re creating. It was also a valuable opportunity to speak with investors informally, to hear your perspectives on the year we’ve just had, and to share some of the ambitions that are shaping our plans for the months ahead. What really struck me was the consistency of enthusiasm; it’s clear that everyone shares my excitement for 2026 and the opportunities it will bring. Away from the new website and the social on Friday night my week was focused on one specific project and several investor calls. I also had at least two new journalists get in touch, both from well-known media outlets, so that all adds to my confidence on where we are heading. My current thinking is that some of the investors we have been speaking to over the last few months will be ready to move forward with supporting us in the very early part of 2026. That is based on what we are doing alongside my perception of their view on the wider market. No weekly update is complete without thanking our amazing SWC community. Thank you to: @andysmith_asap @johnsthor1 @JohnCoo70815409 @80IQConviction @doublediamond65 @Toffeebdm @matthewkerridge @Michaeljdobbin @Boutiquecapital @mattoshi21 @TuftyRaul @BitcoinPlebUK @Morpheus_DX @bitcoin_philos @jay_dee_ex @CloughsStuff @InvestorSmarter @DrBitcoinM50862 @the_desert_ape @jorddd_ @ZynxBTC @wildgoosejon @SmarterBuildBTC @ourgoodlifeuk @AFCB12 @levyuk @butler_np @Raj_Devsi @Frank54703905 @SmarterBuildBTC @DivBy21 @BitcoinBee21 and @smarter_dash . In terms of next week, I will be pushing forward with my main priorities and laying the foundations for what I hope will be a very rewarding 2026. Many of the messages I have sent investors recently have stated that whilst 2025 has been an okay start as a public company I am hoping, and planning, for 2026 to dwarf what we have achieved this year. I hope that you all enjoy your weekends and I appreciate the support. AQUIS: #SWC | OTCQB: $TSWCF | FRA: $3M8",
