    "text": "Hard to say. We are asking them to put us in direct contact with the person that made the decision. You can see from this table that based on data earlier today #SWC is the 4th most liquid stock (by volume of shares - probably 3rd now) on the Aquis exchange and only another 2 are not on HL in that top 30. I believe one of those at least is an Alternative Investment Fund so that is not suitable for retail investors - as opposed to us being an operating business with a digital assets treasury policy which is suitable. I don't think they have made the right decision so I would say that they will allow it when they realise they have made the wrong decision.

They say HL lists almost every stock on the exchange so I have done some testing and it does seem to be the case. The confusion here is just that it is not listed yet so HL can not see liquidity of the stock which is something they want to see alongside people asking to be able to trade it. So all good IMO.",
