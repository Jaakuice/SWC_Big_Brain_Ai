    "text": "The last week has been busy at The Smarter Web Company ( #SWC $TSWCF $3M8.F). We started the week by announcing an equity fundraise for £8.1 million. This was with two investors; one institution and one high-net-worth individual. As I write this our treasury capital sits at a little above £200 million of value which is impressive given that we have been listed for around 3.5 months. On Wednesday I was delighted to announce that we completed our first issuance of Smarter Convert. A strategy that complements our equity placements and ATM style facility to give us a third capital raising option. This is an interest free, Bitcoin denominated bond where, in my opinion, there is no risk to the business as worst-case scenario, we return 98% of the Bitcoin that we have bought with the proceeds. Best case it converts into equity at a premium to the market price when announced. Smarter Convert was fully subscribed by the respected TOBAM for $21 million. TOBAM have been a delight to work with and I want to express my thanks to them once again. I want to also say thank you to our legal team, Jamie, Mario and @Croesus_BTC who worked hard to get this in place. Friday ended the week with us announcing that we have hit the 2,100 Bitcoin held milestone. This is 1% of 1% of all the Bitcoin that will ever exist. I love all the memes about us doing okay and given that around 1 month before we had 1,000 Bitcoin (07 July 2025) I would suggest that is us doing okay. Our community has been active throughout the week although @ourgoodlifeuk has been ill so I hope that he feels better soon. The rest of the community team have been keeping it interesting so shout out to @andysmith_asap @the_desert_ape @ZynxBTC @doublediamond65 @johnsthor1 and @BitcoinBee21 . During the week we did a number of livestreams and these included “Trade Live with IG” @BTCBULLRIDER @BitcoinConfAsia and @Anders_ . I was told that in July we did around 70 different live events and I am pleased that we can speak to people that much as its always a pleasure to update on what we have been doing. The next few weeks are looking pretty hectic currently. This includes several days in London seeing a number of different investors. We have @BitcoinConfAsia in August and a conference organised by @TimKotzman in New York in September. Tim is also doing a virtual conference this Tuesday. I have already booked several investor meetings around both the Hong Kong and New York events as when I am there is it is important to maximise the available time in these different locations for the maximum benefit. In the UK I am looking forward to ​“The Digital Commonwealth” event in London, “Bitcoin. Sovereignty. Economics.” in Bury Saint Edmunds and both the “Feast+Bitcoin” events organised by the lovely @HenryBTCchef near Stroud. These UK events are all taking place in September. Finally on the web design operating business; please do not forget that if you are looking to improve your website, or work within a business looking to do the same, that The Smarter Web Company offers an affordable, high quality, web design service. You can get in touch with Alex in the office if you are looking for help here. I am looking forward to next week already and as always most grateful for everyone’s support.",

    "text": "The Smarter Web Company ( #SWC $TSWCF $3M8.F) weekly update is online a little earlier as I am still in Hong Kong where we are 7 hours ahead of the UK. I am nearing the end of the visit to Hong Kong for @BitcoinConfAsia so will shortly be travelling back to the UK. Bitcoin Asia has been great, and it has been nice to both catch up with people and then meet so many new and interesting people. It was a tough week for the share price. We talked about this in a X spaces with @the_desert_ape and @ZynxBTC on Friday and we believe that we are executing the strategy well despite the market not currently agreeing. I do appreciate that it is uncomfortable for some shareholders, but our share price will always be volatile: it is just more pleasant when it is volatile to the upside. In the UK it was a 4-day week as we had a bank holiday on Monday. We started the \"working week\" with news on Tuesday giving an update on our subscription agreement raising £3.7m. On Wednesday we then announced a change of auditor. This is an important aspect for our future business growth. We have been lucky to work with Adler Shine during the first few months, and they have been a pleasure to work with. As we enter an exciting new phase, we have selected PKF Littlejohn as our new auditor and look forward to working with them. Thursday was then the start of the Bitcoin Asia conference, and we also announced an additional 45 Bitcoin acquired, taking our current Bitcoin Treasury to 2,440 Bitcoin. #SWC is currently ranked number 25 on @BTCtreasuries and will do our best to advance from here. With pre-conference commitments on Wednesday and then two busy conference days during Thursday and Friday the week has been incredibly productive and having the support of @Croesus_BTC alongside me in Hong Kong has been fantastic. Today (Saturday) my schedule allows me to spend some time with @TheBitcoin__ where he has kindly offered to show me Hong Kong as someone that knows the city well. We will aim to create some content as we move around the city. This is my first real chance to have a little free time since arriving. I am so proud of our X community, and I think that its one of the best aspects about #SWC . In just 4 months over 4,100 people have joined the community and to see everyone sharing research and supporting each other when the market is testing conviction is an amazing thing. Shout out to: @andysmith_asap @the_desert_ape @ZynxBTC @ourgoodlifeuk @doublediamond65 @johnsthor1 and @BitcoinBee21 . Finally, I want to thank everyone for their support, and I hope that you all have a good weekend.",

    "text": "A tough week in terms of share price for The Smarter Web Company ( #SWC $TSWCF $3M8.F). We ended the week down (on the week) but in my view the business is considerably stronger than it was just a few weeks ago. Our operating business is in good shape, and I am looking forward to our new Marketing Manager joining soon. Our Bitcoin Treasury mNAV now is now 2 which seems mispriced to me. The question that we have all been discussing this week is why are global mNAVs compressing? Is this something that was natural after a few strong months or a result of the market to trying to value an increasing number of different Bitcoin Treasury companies? Will we see mNAVs improve over the next few months? There are many different answers to these questions, including the view that mNAV is simply sentiment towards companies progressing a Bitcoin strategy. I believe, you will not be surprised to know, P/BYD is how investors should think about Bitcoin Treasury valuations. I had a good (private) chat with @adrian_R_Morris this week and we explored some of these questions and I hope that I will join him on one of his live streams soon to continue that chat when you can all also join us. In my opinion Bitcoin itself is looking strong, and I believe that mNAVs of Bitcoin Treasury companies that can demonstrate progress well should improve in short order. During the week I did several different live streams, meeting with @itsToghrul from @CCNDotComNews and @borjamartels from @RoxomTV for the first time. @AlexandreLaizet from @_ALCPB joined @Croesus_BTC and I to speak with @AllenHODL from @bitcoinforcorps where we discussed the outlook for Bitcoin Treasury companies in Europe and the UK which was also fun. I have tremendous respect for Alexandre and think that he is a credit to the Bitcoin world. As always, the SWC X community has been growing, now with over 4,100 members and my thanks go to the whole community but especially @andysmith_asap @the_desert_ape @ZynxBTC @ourgoodlifeuk @doublediamond65 @johnsthor1 and @BitcoinBee21 . On Friday afternoon I listened in to the last minute spaces with The Desert Ape, Zynx, Jessie and others discussing the week and it was good to see such support from everyone. I did not realise that it was happening when it was live as I have been struggling for time all week but I was able to listen to the recording last night. Today sees The Times in the UK also have a balanced article written by @dominicoc . I am pleased to see the larger media outlets in the UK start to talk about Bitcoin Treasury companies. This wider coverage is extremely positive as it shows a larger group of investors the value proposition offered. During this week I have had many different meetings with potential investors, and these have been both in person and virtual. My focus is on attracting the right capital, on the right terms, at the right time and I believe that to date I have done this reasonably well. I can not make specific promises but what I can say is that I will not do financings that I do not agree with or that do not create the value that I am looking for. Specifically in the last few weeks, I have been encouraged with how the UK institutional capital is recognising the value in what our company is doing, and this is in stark contrast to the conversations we were having just a few months before. Not all are ready to support us, but the majority understand the value proposition and a few months before it was the minority. It was particularly pleasing to see a large UK broker (Peel Hunt) create their first research note on the Bitcoin Treasury space. Some of you will be going to Hong Kong for next weeks @BitcoinConfAsia conference and I am excited about this event. It will be great to join a few discussions, and I will also enjoy watching @Croesus_BTC talk at the event. During the week people will have seen our announcement where Jesse is now a full-time member of our team, and we are lucky to have his talent helping to build SWC for the future. Finally, I would like to say how grateful I am to everyone that has supported us so far. I know that it is hard when the share price is going in the opposite direction to the progress that we are making but the whole team is focused on shareholder value. At SWC we have a significant Bitcoin Treasury, an operating business with growth potential, we have the capital tools at our disposal required for growth, we are building a team of world class talent and we believe that our business strategy will allow us to achieve our ambitions. We have achieved a reasonable scale in a short time, but we believe when we look back in 12 months our size today will seem small. And we are doing all this with the power of Bitcoin: the best asset that the world has ever seen.",

    "text": "We have had another week of progress at The Smarter Web Company PLC ( #SWC $TSWCF $3M8.F). The last few weeks have seen increased volatility in companies adopting Bitcoin as a treasury asset and we are extremely focused on the task of growing SWC into the company that I hope you all want us to become. For this last week I have been away on a family holiday, booked before the IPO process began. The pace of activity within the company meant the week was a mix of both business and holiday. I had several face-to-face meetings, but I managed to also take some time off, and Abu Dhabi proved to be a fantastic destination. I am looking forward to coming back for Bitcoin Mena @bitcoinmenaconf in December. Back to SWC… We started the week with an update on our ATM-style facility on Monday. In the period detailed in the update (3 weeks) we raised £19.7 million at an average price of approximately £3.25. We have also committed to providing the market with an update on this facility every 2 weeks, with the next update going out in a little over 1 week from now. Our Bitcoin holdings have now grown to 2,050. We announced this milestone on Wednesday, which places us as the 25th largest publicly listed corporate holder of Bitcoin globally, according to @BTCTreasuries . The SWC X community has been active as always. Now with over 3,800 members and a special shout out as always to @ourgoodlifeuk @the_desert_ape @ZynxBTC @doublediamond65 @johnsthor1 and @BitcoinBee21 . Yesterday I watched @Croesus_BTC catch up with James from the community and I am extremely proud to have him as part of our team. As always he explained everything we are doing with as much transparency and detail as we can. During the week a podcast that @Croesus_BTC and I recorded with @PrestonPysh went live and if you have not watched it yet you can find this on my timeline. We had a great chat and this was the moment that Jesse and I decided to publish the “The P/E Ratio For Bitcoin Treasury Companies: P/BYD” which you can find on our website. This week I also confirmed with @TimKotzman that I can make it to “The Bitcoin Treasuries NYC Unconference” on Wednesday 17 September in New York. If you are in the area it should be a great event. If you go, please make sure that you say hello. I will be in NYC for 2 days after the conference, meeting with investors, and then travelling back overnight on Friday to go straight to the “Bitcoin. Sovereignty. Economics.” Event ( @BSEconf ) on Saturday 20 September which should be a nice day. If you are in the UK, then that is an event that is worth attending. I am travelling back to the UK today and looking forward to being back at my desk on Monday. Which brings us onto what can we expect next week? I always try and ensure that each week has some clear things that I can use to demonstrate progress. As I have said recently, we are focused on finding the right capital that can support the business in getting to where I want SWC to be. These discussions take time, and I believe that in the not-too-distant future we will be able to announce a number of extremely supportive, large, new investors to go alongside all the great shareholders that we currently have. We have also been working on recruitment for several key positions alongside a few other important projects which are all moving ahead nicely. On top of this we have an operating business which Alex does an amazing job of managing. I am grateful for everyone’s support, and we will keep focusing on the mission: to make SWC into one of the largest public companies in the UK.",

    "text": "A quieter week for UK equity markets with a little volatility from Bitcoin added in, but we have been as busy as ever at the Smarter Web Company ( #SWC $TSWCF $3M8.F). We started the week with an announcement on Monday updating our investors about the ATM style facility that we have. We announced that we placed new shares raising £7.6m (before expenses) in a 2-week period. It is helpful for investors to get an update every 2 weeks, and it also allows us to receive the proceeds on that rolling basis. On Tuesday we announced a further 295 Bitcoin purchased, taking our treasury to 2,395 which is a reasonable increase. If you look at the 30-day yield figure a 76% increase is certainly okay. Later in the day on Tuesday I also chatted with @TimKotzman at his virtual conference, and I admire his work ethic. We often say that managing a Bitcoin Treasury is like a marathon where you sprint every day and Tim is certainly someone that understands high performance work. I spent Wednesday in London meeting potential investors and the meetings are always enjoyable. We are getting a lot more inbound interest now and have noticed that UK institutional investors are seeing the potential in companies that are adding Bitcoin to their balance sheet more than they did just a few months ago. When I returned to my desk on Wednesday it was fantastic to receive a gift from several shareholders who created a frame with a marker for the recently hit level of 2,100 Bitcoin, then two placeholders for the future. We will do our best to get to these levels (21,000 and then 210,000). Thursday morning was full of interviews for a Marketing Manager role that we have now filled. I am hoping that the successful candidate will be able to start soon, and we look forward to welcoming them to the team. Their role will be split between the web design operating business, aiming to help us grow, and several PLC marketing tasks. Over the next few weeks, we also have 2 other people starting as we are building a team of exceptional individuals that are critical to take the company where I want us to be. Our stated strategy is clear and I think all the elements within our “10 Year Plan” are aligned for success. Whilst the market volume is lower, to be expected in August, the community has been as active as ever. A shout out to @andysmith_asap @the_desert_ape @ZynxBTC @doublediamond65 @johnsthor1 and @BitcoinBee21 . On Thursday I enjoyed catching up for a chat with @ourgoodlifeuk and you can see that interview on my feed. I have a lot to fit into this coming week, starting with a day in London seeing more investors on Monday and then an interview which should go out live at 14:00 UK time. After this week I will then travel to Hong Kong for @BitcoinConfAsia . I have not seen my fellow director @tylev in person since Vegas so I am looking forward to catching up with him and @Croesus_BTC will also be in Hong Kong where we are both talking at the conference. I am also seeing several potential investors alongside industry contacts, so I am looking forward to that trip immensely. Please don’t forget that @Croesus_BTC and I will be catching up with @AlexandreLaizet from @_ALCPB this week, on Thursday 21 August at 17:00 UK time. That should be a great chat on spaces. This week our merch has come back into stock. On our investor relations website (under the community tab) you can now order the hoodies and t-shirts again and now we also have the caps. I am really pleased with them and in just a few days we have already sold quite a few. The whole team at SWC and I appreciate your support, and we hope to be able to talk about some more of the things that we have been working on soon. However, please understand that as a public company we can only announce things in the correct way. As we have always done, and will always do, we aim to communicate the business progress with the utmost transparency.",

We’ve just received a thoughtful gift from several The Smarter Web Company ( #SWC $TSWCF $3M8.F) shareholders to celebrate hitting the 2,100 Bitcoin target (we are now at 2,395 Bitcoin).

We are now position 23 on the @BTCtreasuries leader board and there are many great companies adding Bitcoin to the balance sheet with pace. I suspect that @DavidFBailey with @nakamoto will be entering the race with a really strong number very soon. Keep pushing everyone - we all make Bitcoin stronger together.",
