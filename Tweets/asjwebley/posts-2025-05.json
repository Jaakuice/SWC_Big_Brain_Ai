    "text": "Thank you for the questions. We have been profitable every year for 15 years; every year since I set up the company. I am not allowed to give projections for this year although note we have slightly higher costs now and we are focused on more revenue at the same time. This leads us onto the question of previous financials. If you check out the admission document (on our investor relations website) you can see audited accounts for the LTD for the last 2 years and in that you can see detailed financials. Note that since the LTD was a private company then then certain costs would not be incurred in the future. On custody we use several different major partners - a very similar approach to Strategy, Metaplanet and other large companies who hold Digital Assets (including Bitcoin) on their balance sheet. Finally on the amount of Bitcoin we hold currently we have disclosed this to the market and please refer to funds raised / the admission document / financials as I can not disclose more than that currently.",

    "text": "Sorry but I do not know on all the different platforms. I do know quite a lot about HL as you can imagine. They don't allow limits on Aquis stocks but they do allow fill or kill orders which are normally left with a limit when the market is closed. They will also allow online dealing in #SWC shares. What you can do with some brokers especially if dealing in size is telephone them and ask them to place an order to be worked in the market e.g. price is 4.5p to 5p with normal market size 50,000 shares. You want to buy 2,000,000 shares. So you leave the order with your broker who speaks to the market maker and they will agree a price for some / all the order then work the rest throughout the day and square it at the end of the day. These market orders always lapse with anything unfilled at the end of a day so they are not really used for people looked for a lower price - more for people buying above a normal market size. I would imagine a lot of brokers do not allow limit orders on Aquis stocks so your best approach (IMO) is to monitor the price and then deal it online when it is at a level you are looking for.",

    "text": "I can't comment on the numbers but an observation / question for you. How will you incorporate new money / shares in issue into the table / calculation? Are you planning to do that based on the admission date of the new shares; e.g. last week we announced that we had raised £2.24m with an admission date in the RNS of 13 May so will that be the date you use? My view is perhaps it is better to use the date when the funding is announced (08 May) but that is just my opinion based on ease of investors digesting that change in the capital of the company. Away from this, as said before, this is a fantastic independent view.",
