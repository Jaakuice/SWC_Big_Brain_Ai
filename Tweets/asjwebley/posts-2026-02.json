    "text": "It has been another busy week for The Smarter Web Company. One aspect we perhaps do not speak about often enough is the importance of people. Businesses do not execute strategy - people do. It is the individuals within an organisation who turn vision into action, who navigate complexity, and who carry responsibility when decisions matter most.\n\nI am fortunate to work alongside a group of hardworking, passionate individuals who are committed to delivering our mission every single day. Their effort and focus are first class. I am grateful for the contribution each person makes - it is their dedication that strengthens the foundations of this company. A foundation that is built on digital capital.\n\nWhat makes this more impressive is that we are doing this at a time when arguably Bitcoin sentiment is the lowest it’s been. It’s easy to get distracted by the short-term noise which is why we only make decisions for the medium to long term.\n\nWhilst Bitcoin is currently testing many in terms of price, this is not unfamiliar territory. Volatility has always been part of its journey. Alongside that volatility, one of Bitcoin’s finest qualities is that it tests conviction. That quality is not written directly into the mathematics, but it has consistently rewarded those who understand its long-term potential.\n\nWe are living through a structural shift toward digital capital. The simple question is whether you believe in a digital future for the world? If you do, then periods of uncertainty are part of the transition, not a contradiction of it.\n\nAt the same time, I fully appreciate that market movements can be challenging. Our focus remains clear: to make every single aspect of the company as strong as possible – operationally, strategically and financially - so that we are positioned to capitalise on opportunities as they arise.\n\nThe company has never been stronger than it is today, and I have absolute confidence in our strategy. And in the team executing it.\n\nWe started this week by announcing the proceeds from our ATM style facility. We raised £542,897 (before expenses), at an average of approximately £0.38 per share.\n\nWe also announced that @phongle (CEO of @Strategy) will be doing a virtual presentation at our Bitcoin Treasuries Unconference UK event in May. I am very happy with the list of speakers we have and if you have an interest in attending, ticket details can be found on our website.\n\nOn Wednesday I was pleased to be able to announce our second Bitcoin purchase of 2026. We added another 15 Bitcoin to our treasury, taking the total amount added in 2026 to 25 Bitcoin. In a tough market this is acceptable to me however my focus is on how we can increase these buys.\n\nDuring the week both @Croesus_BTC and I spent a reasonable amount of time speaking with different people on either live streams or podcasts that will be released soon. Jesse spoke with @investorsmarter who is starting a podcast. On Wednesday I spoke with @Anders_ for Smarter Webley Wednesdays. On Thursday we did a livestream together and then late in the evening we recorded a podcast with the amazing @timkotzman which should come out early next week.\n\nAt the start of the week there was a small issue with stamp duty being applied by brokers when people bought our shares. Something that was not wholly unexpected as I believe that we are the first Main Market listed company to qualify for the stamp duty exemption (for 3 years) which is a recent change the UK government has made. This is something that our community raised with the brokers, brokers and we had been working on with our advisers behind the scenes.\n\n@aw_smarterwebuk has also spent some time working on our analytics dashboard to improve the speed when the page loads. It is something that we decided to develop ourselves and offers a good range of Bitcoin treasury analytics which investors can monitor in real time. At some point we will expand this further and when we do decide to do that work, we will engage with our community to ask if there are any other metrics that they would like added.\n\nDuring the week I have also had one of the busiest weeks for some time with virtual meetings and I have a similar schedule into next week. I am pleasantly surprised by the institutional attitude towards Bitcoin currently with most seeming to see this as a good entry rather than anything that contradicts our thesis.\n\nThe Smarter Web Company would not be as strong without our community supporting us. Shout out to: @andysmith_asap @johnsthor1 @JohnCoo70815409 @80IQConviction @HenryBTCchef @doublediamond65 @Toffeebdm @matthewkerridge @Michaeljdobbin @Boutiquecapital @mattoshi21 @TuftyRaul @BitcoinPlebUK @Morpheus_DX @BitcoinCartoon_ @bitcoin_philos @jay_dee_ex @CloughsStuff @InvestorSmarter @DrBitcoinM50862 @the_desert_ape @jorddd_ @ZynxBTC @wildgoosejon @SmarterBuildBTC @ourgoodlifeuk @AFCB12 @levyuk @butler_np @Raj_Devsi @Frank54703905 @SmarterBuildBTC @DivBy21 @BitcoinBee21 and @smarter_dash.\n\nOften our community post or create things that I find amazing. This is true on @smarter_dash. Yesterday morning I played around with a new feature that they have created called “Ask AI Andrew”. I asked several questions and was pleased with the responses. It was as if I had asked myself although please note that this is a community driven AI tool and whilst I was pleased with the responses if you “Ask AI Andrew” a question it is not me!\n\nLooking ahead to next week I have another busy week at my desk. The following week we then start the annual conference appearances with the first one being talking at Strategy World in Las Vegas. I have tremendous respect for what @saylor and @Strategy have done and it is an honour to be invited to present at their conference.\n\nOver the coming months I am also talking at @CheatCodeCon in the UK, @BitcoinconfIRL in Ireland and @MadBitcoin_2026  in Spain. On top of this on 29 May we are hosting the Bitcoin Treasuries Unconference UK and if you visit our website, you can find out more about the event or buy tickets.\n\nThank you for your continued support.\n\nLSE: #SWC | OTCQB: $TSWCF | FRA: $3M8",

If true then this is positive and the way we believe stamp should be treated for a newly listed company on LSE.\n\nCan I ask for some help from anyone with a HL or AJ Bell account to do a test purchase this morning so that we have clarity that the two largest brokers are not charging stamp duty and then that should mean that we have a definitive answer and any brokers then with the stamp duty being applied can be pointed towards these examples.\n\nPlease note that this was a change in the recent budget and I believe we are the first UK stock to then not have stamp on a Main Market listing so the stamp issue is not wholly unexpected.\n\nThanks.",

    "text": "This week marked an important milestone for The Smarter Web Company. One Tuesday our shares started trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange.\n\nStructurally, this is a significant step forward for the business. It reflects the scale we have reached, the ambition we hold, and our intent to operate at the highest standards of governance, transparency and institutional credibility. A London Stock Exchange listing is part of our structural strategy - one that positions The Smarter Web Company for its next phase of growth and broadens our relevance to a wider, global capital base.\n\nAlongside this pivotal milestone, there is of course another story to tell. This was a week with two very distinct sides, and it reinforced the reality that we are not following a conventional path.\n\nIn my view, Bitcoin is the best asset the world has ever seen. One of the core properties that has driven the growth and value of the network to date - volatility - is also the aspect that many find most challenging. When digital capital sits on a corporate balance sheet, that volatility can be amplified, and of course reflected directly in a company’s share price. This is not always comfortable, particularly during periods of heightened market movement.\n\nAt moments like this, it is important to zoom out and return to the basics. The Smarter Web Company has been structured deliberately around these characteristics. Our strategy is not designed to minimise volatility in the short term, but to harness the long-term qualities that have historically defined Bitcoin as the best-performing asset class since its inception.\n\nI have absolute conviction in Bitcoin and in its role within our treasury strategy. I intend to continue acquiring Bitcoin forever, regardless of the price. At the same time, I recognise that this level of volatility is not easy for all shareholders, and I respect that it can be challenging, particularly over shorter time horizons. Encouragingly, many of our shareholders understand the strategy, the trade-offs involved, and the opportunity that comes with maintaining conviction through periods like this.\n\nWe remain laser focused, disciplined and long-term in our approach. Whilst it may be hard for some to hear I would like to remind everyone that volatility is not a flaw.\n\nBefore covering some of the areas for this week it’s important to acknowledge that this was one of the most volatile weeks in a long time, not just for Bitcoin but for the broader market. Bitcoin recorded its largest single-day drop since the FTX collapse and, at one point, was down more than 50% from its October highs pushing it into the third most oversold level in its history. At the same time, there were notable moves across other asset classes, with clear signs of broad de-risking and forced unwinds - silver, tech stocks, and former winners all coming under pressure. This view was reinforced by discussions with several professional funds throughout the week. It’s easy to get caught in a “Bitcoin-only” bubble, which is why I consistently evaluate Bitcoin’s price action in the context of broader cross-asset behaviour.\n\nOn Monday we started the week by announcing an update to our ATM style subscription facility. In the preceding week we raised £0.1 million gross proceeds and as a reminder we update the market every Monday where shares have been sold in the preceding week. I travelled to London in the afternoon and we had a team meal allowing us to bring everyone together which I enjoyed immensely.\n\nOn Tuesday we joined shareholders, advisers and some special guests to open the day’s trading at the London Stock Exchange for our admission day. We also held a shareholder drinks reception, in the evening, and to have the opportunity to informally chat to many of our shareholders was one of the weeks highlights.\n\nTo see a company that you founded list on the Main Market of London Stock Exchange is quite surreal and it was special. For me, personally, the reality is that it has not really sunk in, but I am sure that in the weeks the follow it will. I am very pleased to have delivered this milestone to our shareholders.\n\nOn Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday we had back-to-back days with a planned programme of meetings, moving across London and engaging with a wide range of institutional market participants as we continue to build relationships with those interested in our strategy. There was a lot of constructive dialogue regarding the sector and they do seem very interested in the opportunity that we offer.\n\nThe quality of these discussions was impressive, both in terms of engagement with what The Smarter Web Company has already achieved and also alignment with the long-term vision for the path ahead. The significance of a London Stock Exchange listing featured consistently in these conversations and strongly reinforced my own opinions around its structural importance.\n\nIn between the scheduled meetings @Croesus_BTC and I also managed to catch up with @richonmacro from IG Index and you can see the interviews on my timeline. Rich has been interested in our company since the start, and it is always a pleasure to chat with him.\n\nOn Thursday evening I returned to Bristol, where I live, and continued the work from my desk for Friday. We have several projects that are progressing well and it is important to try and advance the business every week.\n\nDuring the week we received some mainstream media coverage, including Bloomberg, The Telegraph and The Daily Mail, but I do think that we need to improve the coverage we can achieve. Since we first became a publicly traded company, we have received coverage with almost all the household names, but I do think that we could build on this and get more coverage. This is one of the areas where I want to improve.\n\nI have not spent as much time on X this week although I have tried my best to check in where I can. I am always impressed by our community of shareholders. It is amazing to see the understanding of what we are building and the support offered is appreciated. Shout out to: @andysmith_asap @johnsthor1 @JohnCoo70815409 @80IQConviction @HenryBTCchef @doublediamond65 @Toffeebdm @matthewkerridge @Michaeljdobbin @Boutiquecapital @mattoshi21 @TuftyRaul @BitcoinPlebUK @Morpheus_DX @BitcoinCartoon_ @bitcoin_philos @jay_dee_ex @CloughsStuff @InvestorSmarter @DrBitcoinM50862 @the_desert_ape @jorddd_ @ZynxBTC @wildgoosejon @SmarterBuildBTC @ourgoodlifeuk @AFCB12 @levyuk @butler_np @Raj_Devsi @Frank54703905 @SmarterBuildBTC @DivBy21 @BitcoinBee21 and @smarter_dash.\n\nLooking ahead to this next week, while I cannot go into specifics, the focus remains the same: execution to advance The Smarter Web Company. I remain focused on ensuring that each day, each week, meaningfully contributes to the Company’s long-term objectives.\n\nOverall, I am more excited about the near-term opportunity for the business than at any point to date. Thank you to everyone who continues to support The Smarter Web Company and its journey. From our shareholders, our team, our partners and of course my family. Together, we are building a company rooted in the UK, founded on digital capital, and one that we can all be very proud of.\n\nLSE: #SWC | OTCQB: $TSWCF | FRA: $3M8",

    "text": "A volatile day yesterday for Bitcoin and Bitcoin treasury companies.\n\nIn over 25 years of investing, I’ve learned that you can’t pick the bottom. But when price moves are wide, FUD is loud, and some people are starting to give up, that is often when a bottom begins to form.\n\nOf course, only time will tell. From my own personal perspective, however, I could not be more confident in Bitcoin’s future as digital capital in its purest form.\n\nMy own attitude to Bitcoin is unchanged: I intend to buy Bitcoin regardless of price - and to continue doing so indefinitely.\n\nThat said, I fully understand why periods like this can feel uncomfortable, which is why it’s always worth reminding ourselves why we chose to invest in the first place.\n\nThis is my personal view and not financial advice.",

    "text": "Sentiment around Bitcoin feels firmly in the gutter right now. FUD is loud, confidence is thin, and volatility is doing what volatility always does - testing conviction.\n\nHistorically, it’s often when things feel as bad as they possibly can that markets snap back. Not because the timing is predictable - it never is - but because extremes in sentiment tend not to last.\n\nThat said, investing - particularly at the corporate treasury level - shouldn’t be about calling the exact bottom. None of us knows when that will be. It should be about positioning for the medium to long term, across good, bad, and flat Bitcoin conditions.\n\nThe Smarter Web Company model is explicitly designed with that long-term reality in mind. It’s built to function through volatility, not to be derailed by it.\n\nI remain of the opinion that Bitcoin is unlikely to fall significantly from here. And when Bitcoin does reverse - if history is any guide - it will come back faster and harder than most expect.\n\nAs ever, this is my personal view and not financial advice.",
