    "text": "Thank you for the question. I believe the ATM has been an important and effective capital tool alongside the other funding routes we have used to date. In aggregate, it has generated capital that accounts for approximately 25% of our Bitcoin treasury and, over the last ~8 months, has materially assisted us in delivering Bitcoin yield. That said, by definition an ATM does increase the supply of shares over time, and it would be unrealistic to suggest that this has had no impact on trading dynamics. The facility has been used deliberately and pragmatically to fund treasury growth, and we have always weighed the cost of dilution against the opportunity to accrete Bitcoin per share and strengthen the balance sheet. As we move forward, our treasury focus remains on disciplined capital allocation, improving per-share metrics, and ensuring that any use of equity issuance is value-accretive over the medium to long term.",

    "text": "Ever since founding The Smarter Web Company in 2009, I have always enjoyed January. It is a month when many people choose to start new businesses, which is positive for our operating company as it often leads to new projects and opportunities. But for me, January is also about the renewed energy and optimism that comes with a fresh year - a time when people reflect on what they want to achieve and how they intend to get there. Over the Christmas period, I have taken the opportunity to look back on 2025, both at our own performance and that of our peers. I have reflected on what we did well, where we fell short, and, most importantly, what we can do better. Trying to learn from others where possible. 2025 was not the year many expected for Bitcoin. Despite reaching a local high in October, it ultimately recorded a down year. I was not dissatisfied with this performance; after nearly a decade of investing in Bitcoin, I have learned that it rarely behaves exactly as anticipated. History has shown that periods of weakness are often followed by strength. And the long-term trend is very much up. If we look at previous negative years, they have typically been succeeded by strong recoveries. Taking the post-decline years of 2015, 2019, and 2023, Bitcoin delivered an average annual gain of 93.7%, following an average decline of 55.7%, in the preceding years: -30% (2014) +34% (2015) -73% (2018) +92% (2019) -64% (2022) +155% (2023) While past performance is not indicative of future results, I am highly optimistic about what 2026 may hold for Bitcoin. When I combine that outlook with what we have been building and what we intend to focus on in 2026, my confidence increases further. During 2025, the term “digital capital” began to gain traction, describing companies such as The Smarter Web Company that are deliberately building Bitcoin into their balance sheets as the core capital asset. As this approach develops, different strategies are already beginning to emerge. I am confident that, as the year progresses, further models will appear, allowing the market to learn what works best in different conditions and regions. Against this backdrop, I believe it is helpful to revisit two scenarios we have discussed on numerous occasions, to demonstrate why we believe our model is resilient - not only when Bitcoin sentiment is strong or prices are rising, but also when sentiment is weak or prices are declining. 1. Positive sentiment or rising prices If Bitcoin performs strongly (and SWC trades above 1x mNAV), this represents the most straightforward scenario. In these conditions, our ATM facility would be able to operate effectively, and we would expect robust demand from both short-term momentum investors and longer-term value investors for fund raises in our equity, and our shareholder register should continue to institutionalise. Distributing Smarter Convert, our Bitcoin-backed convertible, should also be more straightforward. Strong price action has the potential to create a positive feedback loop that supports the continued execution of our Bitcoin accumulation strategy. In this context, updating our subscription facility recently was an important step, providing additional flexibility and ensuring we are well positioned as sentiment improves. 2. Negative sentiment or falling prices If Bitcoin trades sideways or declines (with SWC below 1x mNAV), we have been actively exploring a range of alternative tools. These include the responsible use of debt, share buybacks, potential adjustments to the convertible structure, and other options. Discussions on these topics have been ongoing with our advisers, team, investors, and key stakeholders. Some options are more attractive than others, and any decision will ultimately depend on prevailing market conditions. Importantly, the current scale of our balance sheet - holding 2,664 Bitcoin - provides meaningful flexibility and a range of actionable choices. To ensure we are prepared, we have already begun putting several of these tools in place, starting with shareholder approval for buybacks at the recent General Meeting, alongside other initiatives that are progressing but cannot yet be disclosed. Regardless of market conditions, it’s important to remember we remain fully committed to growing our operating business. We are proud of the service we offer and believe we occupy a differentiated position that allows us to scale while maintaining very high operating margins via our focus on advisory, hosting, and ongoing support services. Over time, we expect this operating strength to both support continued Bitcoin accumulation and provide a resilient cash buffer, ensuring the sustainability of The Smarter Web Company no matter where we are in the Bitcoin cycle. In an asset class defined by volatility, our focus remains on discipline (rather than prediction) and sticking to a long-term view. By preparing for a wide range of outcomes and maintaining flexibility in how we raise and deploy capital, we believe we are well positioned to navigate uncertainty while remaining firmly aligned with our long-term objective of growing Bitcoin per share. As I have said before, there is no single “right” way to execute a Bitcoin strategy. Different companies will pursue different approaches depending on their circumstances, stage of development and region. We are confident in the work underway to ensure we have a clear, well-informed understanding of the options available to us across all market conditions, and I look forward to sharing more detail at the appropriate time. As always, I want to thank our community members for their ongoing support and for everything they do to support The Smarter Web Company.

Finally, while I enjoyed a brief period of downtime over the Christmas break - even with some work continuing in the gap days - it was a welcome opportunity to spend time with my family. As we start January, however, my focus turns firmly to the year ahead and to several initiatives we have been working on that are now approaching the point of announcement. I am confident that a number of these developments will be well received by our shareholders as they become known. 2025 was a year focused on laying strong foundations, and in 2026 we intend to build decisively upon them.

    "text": "We can look back to the early days of the internet and recall the companies once described as “brave” for launching a website more than 25 years ago. At the time, having a web presence was a differentiator. Today, describing yourself as an “internet company” would be meaningless - and choosing not to embrace the internet would be commercially unthinkable. What once appeared optional quickly became foundational. I believe that we are now seeing the same transition with companies that embrace digital capital. Organisations now have a genuine choice in how capital is structured, interconnected, and allowed to compound intelligently over time. Looking ahead, the most durable organisations will be those that treat capital not simply as a balance sheet item, but as an architecture designed for resilience and long-term compounding. In my view, digital capital has truly arrived. When structured well, it does more than store value - it amplifies it. Unlike fiat-based capital, digital capital does not exist with discretionary expansion or central control. It is built on the Bitcoin network: a system not wholly controlled by any country, company, or individual. One with a fixed supply that cannot be increased and is accessible to anyone who chooses to engage with it. Digital capital is not a speculative idea. It is an architectural one. What we are doing at The Smarter Web Company is best understood through that lens. Step by step, we are putting in place a balance sheet, around our operating business, designed to endure. How digital capital is structured will naturally vary by region and market, and we must understand those differences. A playbook that succeeds in one jurisdiction will not always translate directly to another. Different approaches, in different regions, will emerge. This week has been an extremely constructive one for The Smarter Web Company, with everyone working flat out across multiple projects. After a prolonged period of restricted communication during the LSE listing process, it has been refreshing to re-engage more openly. We began the week by announcing the Bitcoin Treasuries Unconference UK, to be held in Bristol on 29 May. The aim is simple: to provide a full day of high-quality education for those exploring Bitcoin as a form of digital capital. We have assembled an excellent line-up of speakers, supported by strong sponsors. Tickets are available via our website, and we would be delighted to see you there. I have added the link where you can find out more or buy tickets to the comments. Looking ahead, I will also be speaking at Strategy World in Las Vegas during February, where I will take part in the panel International Bitcoin Corporate Adoption. This invitation represents a further endorsement of the credibility of our equity story and the work we are doing. During the week, @Croesus_BTC and I participated in several live discussions. It was enjoyable to talk with so many different people, and recordings of these conversations are available via the links on my timeline. The week began on Monday with conversations with both @Anders_ and @roxomtv , followed by a discussion with @BTCBULLRIDER on Tuesday. On Wednesday, we spoke with both @TheBitcoin__ and @TimKotzman , which also led to an unexpected live conversation with @satmojoe - someone whose thinking and integrity I respect greatly. We concluded the week with a live session on our own YouTube channel on Friday, aimed at bringing shareholders up to date on recent developments along with the direction of travel. On Thursday, we were pleased to announce the purchase of 10 Bitcoin - our first addition to the Bitcoin treasury in almost three months. The past quarter has been challenging for companies building balance sheets on digital capital, but in our view, sentiment towards the model is beginning to improve. While we have been more visible this week - in part because we are now able to speak publicly about our proposed move to the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange - the work inside the business has also continued at pace. We met with a number of institutional investors and as noted last week, they are each at different stages in terms of understanding and ability to invest. Overall, I remain encouraged by the level of engagement and positive receptivity. On our web design operating business, it was also pleasing to see enquiries which would not have arose without our Bitcoin treasury. The increased visibility of being a public company will in time assist with more enquiries and if you are looking to improve your business website then please get in touch and we will be happy to explain how we can help you. I would also like to make a special mention of @LauraStH1991 , whose relentless work ethic enables much of what we can do. Laura’s commitment and attention to detail are first class, and both the company and its shareholders are fortunate to have her as part of the team. It was encouraging to see all the comments within The Smarter Web Company X community during the week. The community has been key to our growth, and I try and read all the comments when time allows. Shout out to: @andysmith_asap @johnsthor1 @JohnCoo70815409 @80IQConviction @HenryBTCchef @doublediamond65 @Toffeebdm @matthewkerridge @Michaeljdobbin @Boutiquecapital @mattoshi21 @TuftyRaul @BitcoinPlebUK @Morpheus_DX @BitcoinCartoon_ @bitcoin_philos @jay_dee_ex @CloughsStuff @InvestorSmarter @DrBitcoinM50862 @the_desert_ape @jorddd_ @ZynxBTC @wildgoosejon @SmarterBuildBTC @ourgoodlifeuk @AFCB12 @levyuk @butler_np @Raj_Devsi @Frank54703905 @SmarterBuildBTC @DivBy21 @BitcoinBee21 and @smarter_dash . As we move closer to our proposed first day of trading on the London Stock Exchange, the reality of attending the opening ceremony in London is becoming very real. It is a moment I am immensely looking forward to, and one I want to share with our shareholders in person. Access to an opening ceremony is rarely available to retail shareholders, and capacity is extremely limited. We therefore felt that a raffle was the fairest way to allocate the available spaces. Details were shared on Friday, and those who would like to take part can find the information and enter via my timeline. I have also posted the link in the comments. That evening, we will also be hosting a shareholder drinks reception, open to all shareholders. From 7:00pm to 9:00pm, we would be delighted to buy you a drink and mark this milestone together. We hope as many of you as possible can join us. Please register your interest on our website and you can find the link in the comments. In my view, The Smarter Web Company is approaching an important inflection point. With the right future decisions, built on a foundation of digital capital, we have a clear opportunity to advance our mission. I am deeply grateful for your continued support, and I am excited about what we can achieve together. AQUIS: #SWC | OTCQB: $TSWCF | FRA: $3M8",

    "text": "In simple terms, the proposed migration of SWC from Aquis to the LSE is not expected to disrupt trading in TSWCF. The OTC Markets team works to ensure continuity of trading when an issuer’s primary listing migrates from one venue to another, so TSWCF shareholders should not need to take any action. TSWCF represents the same underlying ordinary shares, and those shares remain exactly the same as The Smarter Web Company transitions between listing venues. As such, TSWCF does not “move” separately, nor does it need to be exchanged. Thank you for your interest and support.",

    "text": "This week marked a major milestone for The Smarter Web Company as we announced our intention to list on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange. This step represents the culmination of many months of detailed preparation, strategic planning, and close collaboration between our management team and our advisers, all focused on positioning the business for its next phase of growth. We are delighted to now be able to share this important development with our shareholders, who have supported us since our IPO on Aquis approximately 9 months ago. Taking a UK-born business from start-up to a public company is an achievement of which I am extremely proud. The intention to move to the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange marks the next significant milestone in that journey. I am committed to building a British success story that contributes to the UK economy, showcases the strength of the UK’s entrepreneurial spirit in the technology sector, and demonstrates how Bitcoin can be used as digital capital. Transparency has always been a key pillar for The Smarter Web Company. One of the hardest parts of the last few months was that I was extremely limited in what I could communicate. That became even more challenging against a backdrop of weakening sector sentiment, which is a time I wanted to be more visible - I hope shareholders now understand that. Since our IPO, we have delivered on every commitment we set out, and I hope that reaching this important milestone further reinforces confidence in our ability to execute our strategy. Despite time being limited this week, I was pleased to catch up on Wednesday with @ourgoodlifeuk . I undertook just this one media appearance during the week, and it felt entirely appropriate that this would be with James, who established the SWC community in the early days and has interviewed me on numerous occasions since. We covered a wide range of questions during the conversation, and shareholders can watch the full interview by finding the post on my timeline. On Thursday, we also announced the proceeds from two days where shares held within our ATM-style facility were placed. This raised £1,673,092 before expenses, further strengthening our balance sheet. On the same day I had a constructive call with a large UK fund manager where we discussed both Bitcoin and The Smarter Web Company. I said last week that UK Institutions are becoming more open to dialogue and this was yet another demonstration of that - over the next few weeks, we plan to hold more meetings with a range of both global and UK institutions. On Friday, we published our prospectus, which sets out in full the rationale for the proposed listing and the timetable for its completion, as well as a comprehensive overview of our business, strategy and financial position. The publication of the prospectus is a significant moment in the process, providing investors with a clear and transparent view of The Smarter Web Company and the opportunity ahead. I believe that this development reflects both our ambition and our confidence in the long-term prospects of the business as we prepare to join one of the world’s leading public markets. It’s a piece of work we’re extremely proud of and want to thank everyone who was involved with it. Since becoming a public company, one thing that gives me optimism has been the noticeable step forward with regards to understanding Bitcoin and Bitcoin treasury companies. Prior to listing on Aquis, we were extremely limited in the language and industry-relevant terms we could use in official documents - for example, our Bitcoin treasury had to be referred to as a “digital asset treasury policy”. Since then, through consistent dialogue and increased education, we are now able to use terms such as “Bitcoin yield”, “Bitcoin treasury policy”, and “mNAV”. This progress is important to recognise, as it gives us confidence that we are operating within a framework that is open to advancement and enables us to responsibly pursue new opportunities for growth with a balance sheet built on digital capital. I would also like to give a special mention this week to @aw_smarterwebuk . Alex and I have worked together for more than a decade, and since we became a public company, he has taken the lead within our operating business. He is a key part of our team, bringing both deep experience and solid skills, and it is a real pleasure to work alongside him as we continue to build The Smarter Web Company. Our Web design business remains a core part of the company, and we hope to be able to share more details soon on how we plan to scale this. It has been fantastic to see another week of energy and engagement across our community. I hope shareholders will continue to see momentum build as we move forward from here. We have, in my view, the strongest and most engaged Bitcoin treasury community on X, though I freely admit I may be slightly biased. Shout out to: @andysmith_asap @johnsthor1 @JohnCoo70815409 @80IQConviction @HenryBTCchef @doublediamond65 @Toffeebdm @matthewkerridge @Michaeljdobbin @Boutiquecapital @mattoshi21 @TuftyRaul @BitcoinPlebUK @Morpheus_DX @bitcoin_philos @jay_dee_ex @CloughsStuff @InvestorSmarter @DrBitcoinM50862 @the_desert_ape @jorddd_ @ZynxBTC @wildgoosejon @SmarterBuildBTC @ourgoodlifeuk @AFCB12 @levyuk @butler_np @Raj_Devsi @Frank54703905 @SmarterBuildBTC @DivBy21 @BitcoinBee21 and @smarter_dash . Looking ahead to next week, @Croesus_BTC and I will be catching up with various people who have interviewed us previously and please keep an eye on our timelines to find out more. I have also been planning my diary for 2026 as I want to try and get the right balance between attending some of the global events whilst at the same time pushing the business forward - which requires long days at my desk. I am looking forward to sharing some of the events with you in due course. Next week, I hope to also share details of a shareholder raffle for those who would like the opportunity to attend the London Stock Exchange opening ceremony. I thought that would be the fairest way to involve some of our shareholders in an event that shareholders often do not get a chance to experience. When we have all the details, we will post this on X. Separately, we will be hosting an informal drinks event in the evening to mark the occasion and say thank you to all shareholders (details to follow). I would like to end this update by saying how excited I am about what we can achieve this year and as I said last week our internal targets are ambitious yet achievable. While it has been encouraging to see the share price begin to strengthen, the real opportunity lies in what we are building: a modern operating business anchored to a Bitcoin balance sheet. The power of digital capital in today’s world gives us a unique foundation on which to grow, invest and compound value over the long term. Unlocking that potential demands continued focus and disciplined execution and that is exactly what I intend to keep delivering as we build The Smarter Web Company using our 10-year plan. Thank you for your support. AQUIS: #SWC | OTCQB: $TSWCF | FRA: $3M8",

    "text": "I don’t think a one-size-fits-all approach works for institutions, just as retail investors invest in The Smarter Web Company for very different reasons. Since we started, I’ve seen a big improvement in institutional understanding of Bitcoin treasury analytics. What has surprised me most is that some institutional investors behave almost like momentum traders. That said, many can still be grouped broadly as value investors, which is precisely why robust analytics matter: they allow those investors to value our business in a way that aligns with their own frameworks and the timescales that matter most to them. It’s also important to recognise that institutions will typically place significant weight on liquidity and listing venue, and as we scale, factors such as corporate governance become increasingly critical. In summary though, institutional decision-making is driven by a wide range of considerations, and this response only scratches the surface.",

    "text": "It has been a busy week for The Smarter Web Company, and I’m pleased with the progress we have made behind the scenes. Despite Bitcoin remaining choppy, sentiment toward Bitcoin treasury companies has improved. This was reflected in our share price, which performed strongly during the first full trading week of 2026. The Smarter Web Company finished the week up approximately 25%, with an mNAV of 0.82 at the time of publication, supported by healthy trading volume - an encouraging signal of growing investor engagement. On Monday, we held a series of internal strategy sessions to align on our priorities for the quarter, clarify ownership across the team, and identify process improvements based on the lessons we took from last year. While I’m unable to share the specific targets, the outcome gives me strong confidence that our roadmap is both ambitious and highly achievable. On Tuesday, I received a message from a new retail shareholder who had just made a meaningful investment, accompanied by an enthusiastic note. Retail investors were instrumental in building our foundation last year, and messages like this are always a powerful reminder of our mission and the community that stands behind it. In that spirit, I was delighted to see @HenryBTCchef announce that he will be hosting a special evening on 24 April to mark our IPO anniversary. Both @Croesus_BTC and I will be attending, and it will be a great opportunity to come together and thank so many of you who have supported us on this journey. One of the most encouraging things, so far this year, has been the renewed activity across our community. I know the past few months haven’t been easy, so seeing more discussion, contribution, and engagement has been genuinely uplifting. The Smarter Web Company has the third largest (organically grown) Bitcoin treasury investor community on X and this is something we should all be proud of. On Thursday, we announced via RNS the appointment of a new Non-Executive Director, Martin Thomas. Martin brings a strong legal background alongside valuable experience across multiple public markets and growth stages. His breadth of knowledge and perspective will be highly complementary to the existing Board, and we believe his insight will be an important asset as we continue to execute our strategy. On Friday, I had a call with a large institutional investor who provided thoughtful and constructive feedback on how we can continue to sharpen our narrative, tell our story more clearly, and better differentiate ourselves from our peers. While this sector is still relatively new and many investors are still getting up to speed, it has been particularly encouraging - especially in the UK - to see how far some have come and their willingness to engage meaningfully with Bitcoin treasury companies. Throughout the rest of the week, the team and I have been actively engaging with a range of stakeholders to advance several key initiatives toward the point where we can share them publicly. I feel we’ve taken a material step forward this week, and once again I appreciate your patience as we move closer to being able to provide specific updates. As always, I want to thank our community members for their ongoing support.

Looking to the week ahead, while I can’t comment on matters that are not yet in the public domain, I remain very encouraged by the progress we are making. Momentum is building, and we are focused on executing. As always, thank you for your continued support. AQUIS: #SWC | OTCQB: $TSWCF | FRA: $3M8",
