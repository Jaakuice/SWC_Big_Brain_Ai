    "text": "The week has flown by for The Smarter Web Company ( #SWC $TSWCF $3M8.F) in the blink of an eye (again). On Monday I was pleased to be able to announce that we have recruited a new CFO; Albert Soleiman has joined our company as an executive member of the board, and he has had a strong career most recently being CFO of FTSE 250 listed CMC Markets. Albert has hit the ground running and I would also like to thank Mario Visconti for doing the CFO role since listing. Mario is staying within the business and now is our Head of Projects. Monday also saw Lily Howard join the team as Marketing Manager. Lily comes from a marketing background and will be focusing on both marketing our operating business and helping Jesse and I on marketing the Treasury Strategy. She has also had a very productive first week. This Monday we will also welcome Laura Stanton-Hobbs, as Executive Assistant, to our team. During this week we also announced that we have appointed Strand Hanson as our AQUIS Corporate Adviser. We have spent a lot of time over the last few months getting to know the team at Strand Hanson and we are confident that they will add a lot of value to our company as we move forward. On Tuesday I landed back in the UK at around 06:30 after returning from @BitcoinConfAsia in Hong Kong and I have around 2 full weeks before then heading to New York for the @TimKotzman Bitcoin Unconference which looks like it will have all the main people involved with Bitcoin Treasury in attendance. In New York I also have a packed schedule meeting with potential investors and business partners around the event. Thursday saw us update the market on our subscription agreement, often referred to as an ATM style facility. With this we update the market every two weeks, with the next update being this Monday, and we wanted to allocate additional shares to the facility for when the current shares are fully placed. This funding mechanism has been incredibly important for us to date, and we believe that it will play a key role in our strategy of aiming to become one of the largest companies in the UK. One of the (many) things that I am focused on is trying to show those that are less interested in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Treasury companies why it is such a compelling investment opportunity. Part of this strategy is to speak to the traditional media about what we are doing and on Thursday I had a good chat with a lovely journalist who I hope will cover our progress at some point. I had another interesting journalist call on Friday and so I am interested to see what press coverage follows these chats. It is really encouraging to see more people want to speak to us about what we are doing, and I see this as another important aspect of our contribution to the wider Bitcoin movement. On Tuesday @TheBitcoin__ published the “on location podcast” that we filmed when I was at @BitcoinConfAsia and if you have not watched the video then you can find that on my timeline. The opportunity to meet with some amazing people is a privileged part of my job and The Bitcoin Libertarian is a great person, doing great things, for the greatest asset that the world has ever seen. We also did some videos with @RoxomTV and @ProfessorB21 in Hong Kong. Also great people. Our community has been incredible this week. Now with over 4,200 members we are proud to be able to say that we have the third largest Bitcoin Treasury community globally. On Thursday @Croesus_BTC and I did a spaces to talk about the different things that we are doing, and then on Friday Jesse linked up with @ourgoodlifeuk to talk some more. Shout out to: @andysmith_asap @the_desert_ape @ZynxBTC @ourgoodlifeuk @doublediamond65 @johnsthor1 and @BitcoinBee21 as always. I will be in London for a few days this week and very much looking forward to my meetings. I will also be at The Digital Commonwealth @TheDCW_JB at Mansion House in London and The Feast + Bitcoin @HenryBTCchef in Stroud, both taking place on Friday. I appreciate that this week has been another tough one (fiat) share price wise, but we remain laser focused on the mission. As I have said many times we are only just getting started. We do appreciate everyone’s support.",

    "text": "It is time for the weekly update about The Smarter Web Company ( #SWC $TSWCF $3M8.F). Tough markets test investors conviction; strong companies respond with focus and execution. We started this week by updating the market on our Subscription Agreement where we have raised an additional £5m (often referred to as an ATM style facility). The average share price obtained was around £1.30 so, in my opinion, very beneficial to the company. On Monday @Croesus_BTC then appeared on @RoxomTV for a catch up with @borjamartels . After this @mc_khristina joined @Anders_ for a live stream to talk about the opportunity she sees in SWC. On Tuesday we announced our latest Bitcoin buy. We announced 55 Bitcoin bought and this takes our total treasury to 2,525 today. We have a Bitcoin yield of just under 300% quarter-to-date. Bitcoin yield quarter-to-date will reset to 0% in a few days, when we get into the new quarter, and please keep in mind that Bitcoin yield quarter-to-date is a very important metric to use when looking at Bitcoin treasury companies. Later on Tuesday @ourgoodlifeuk , from the SWC community, interviewed @mc_khristina . I would like to point out to everyone that the SWC community is something that we are very proud of but it is not controlled or moderated by the company so it is exactly what a community should be – an independent forum for people to share views on a subject that they are interested in. I follow the comments most days, and neither I nor any company employee controls the community. On Wednesday @Croesus_BTC and I were able to catch up with @Anders_ and we able talked about some of the challenges for Bitcoin treasury companies. We discussed some of the projects we are working on and whilst there are a lot of different projects that we are focused on of course we cannot share some at this stage. Thursday saw @RealCornCannon and @ourgoodlifeuk talk during a live stream about the Subscription Agreement (often referred to as an ATM style facility) and this was a more technical discussion which I enjoyed watching. They have shared the slides, and you can find these posted in the SWC community. Friday was a busy day with the usual mix of things and then in the evening I went to Bitcoin + Feast organised by the wonderful and talented @HenryBTCchef . The food was first class, the company was amazing and my Q&A after dinner was the best that I could do! My younger brother @mrwebleyteach was at the event although I did not get as much time to speak to him as I hoped and it was particularly cool to be joined by my wife at the event and everyone made her feel very welcome - thank you. As always, I want to give a shout out to those working hard to make the SWC community stronger. We have approximately 4,500 members now and we are the third largest Bitcoin treasury community globally. Shout out to: @andysmith_asap @johnsthor1 @JohnCoo70815409 @80IQConviction @doublediamond65 @Michaeljdobbin @Boutiquecapital @InvestorSmarter @DrBitcoinM50862 @the_desert_ape @ZynxBTC @ourgoodlifeuk @AFCB12 and @BitcoinBee21 . A very special mention goes to @BitcoinBee21 who has been putting the hours in recently building out new tools within the SWC dashboard (that he has published online independently to the company). The media section being particularly impressive. Next week will be busy as always. In addition to the numerous tasks that fill a “normal” day I am heading to Singapore for @token2049 . I have not been to this event before, but I have many friends attending, and I have a full diary of meetings around the event. I am proud of the SWC team working alongside me to deliver the mission that we have clearly stated. Thank you to Albert, Sean, @tylev , @aw_smarterwebuk , @Croesus_BTC , @LauraStH1991 , @lh_smarterwebuk and Mario. You will note that a few more of the team are now on X! I appreciate the support that you all offer and look forward to pushing things forward this coming week.",

    "text": "This week has been another painful week for The Smarter Web Company shareholders ( #SWC $TSWCF $3M8.F). It is frustrating to see the global mNAV compression that we have witnessed recently but in my opinion the company has become stronger despite our mNAV compressing. I am about 30 minutes away from landing back in London after being in New York for the last few days and it has been both productive and enjoyable. My time here has been split between the Bitcoin Treasuries Unconference organised by @TimKotzman , catching up with some of our existing shareholders and then a series of other meetings. I have been pleased with the support that people have shown towards what we are doing at SWC. In New York it has also been great having the support from @Croesus_BTC and we are lucky to have such an intelligent, sincere and knowledgeable individual within our team. Sorry that I cannot give a shout out to everyone that I met during the trip but there are too many names to mention and some of the meetings are confidential. Today I am heading to @BSEconf where I am looking forward to meeting with UK Bitcoiners and I am hoping that it will be a great day. After this I will then head back to Bristol and check if my family still recognise me! News flow wise it has been quieter this week. We announced by RNS that we are now using Coinbase’s institutional custody solution on Monday and we also work with a number of other large institutional grade custodians. On Monday I caught up with @roxom and @BTCBULLRIDER and it is always a pleasure speaking with my global friends. On Thursday evening @Croesus_BTC and I chatted with @Sanderandersenn and @TimKotzman , in his studio in New York, after a request from the X community. That was a slightly different format and good fun. I have had less time to check in on our community during the week but a shout out to @andysmith_asap @johnsthor1 @doublediamond65 @Michaeljdobbin @the_desert_ape @ZynxBTC @ourgoodlifeuk and @BitcoinBee21 . One of the key strengths of SWC is our strong community support, and this often comes up in our investor meetings. Please keep up the great work. I have a week back at my desk this coming week and then on Friday I head to the Bitcoin + Feast event with @HenryBTCchef before then flying to Singapore on Sunday for @token2049 where I will also be speaking. Our whole team has been focused on a number of important projects during the week. We have ended the week ahead of where we started, in terms of the business progress, and if we keep pushing forward, I hope that our share price will reflect this progress (in due course). I do appreciate how tough it is for shareholders with the price volatility that we have seen. My job is to focus on building the company that I want SWC to become and thank you for your support.",

    "text": "As shareholders, you deserve a clear view of how your company is progressing each week, and that is one of the reasons why I enjoy writing the weekly update for The Smarter Web Company ( #SWC $TSWCF $3M8.F). The weekly update also allows me to look back and think about the coming week with the question I always ask myself: have we moved things forward from where we were last week? It is worth mentioning that I can only talk about things that are in the public domain so please note that some of the things (quite a lot) of what we do each week does not get a mention. We started the week with the announcement that we have raised £2.6m gross proceeds from our ATM style facility. This relates to shares that our partner has placed in the market during a 2-week period (the last week of August and the first week of September). I had an enjoyable day on Tuesday in London with back-to-back meetings and, as I constantly stress, some of these meetings are really helping us to position the company for where I want us to be in the future. I have talked about the views from more traditional investors towards Bitcoin and Bitcoin Treasury companies, but it is great to see more and more people taking what we are doing seriously and I am yet to meet anyone that has put the time into understanding Bitcoin who can then tell me that it is not a compelling investment opportunity. During these meetings we also talk about valuations and potential; as @Croesus_BTC likes to say Bitcoin Treasury companies are, in our opinion, the best potential equity opportunity globally. Institutional investors are starting to understand concept of compound Bitcoin, and I am looking forward to more institutional investors joining us on our journey. On Wednesday we then announced the latest Bitcoin purchase taking us back to position 25 in the @BTCtreasuries leader board as we now hold 2,470 Bitcoin. Friday was a great day. To start the day an article was published in the @FT and it was amazing to see the FT discuss SWC, what we are doing and where we want to be. I was meant to attend a conference in London during the day, but this has been moved to a later date. In the evening, I headed to Bitcoin + Feast which was organised by the talented @HenryBTCchef with entertainment from @kittylaroar . I had the opportunity to meet lots of interesting people and after the food I did a question-and-answer session with @DecentraSuze which is always fun. I had never met Henry, who organised the event, in person before and he is one of the many wonderful people, passionate about Bitcoin, that I have been lucky to meet through SWC. His food (and bread!) is also out of this world. Our community gets stronger every week and now we have over 4,300 members. The community is a great credit to all involved with lots of different people discussing what we are doing, and I am always humbled by the support when I check the comments. At Bitcoin + Feast on Friday I spent a bit of time with @andysmith_asap @johnsthor1 and @doublediamond65 . And shout out to: @Michaeljdobbin @the_desert_ape @ZynxBTC @ourgoodlifeuk and @BitcoinBee21 as always. Next week allows me to spend a few days in New York for the @TimKotzman Bitcoin Treasuries Unconference on Wednesday with meetings planned before and after. I am really looking forward to catching up with several shareholders who have supported us since the start, some potential new investors, several possible partners and it will also be great to meet new people. On Friday night I fly back to the UK where I will be going straight to @BSEconf from the airport; it will be nice to attend an event in the UK, and I am hoping to meet lots of our shareholders here. I will aim to get next weeks update out around the usual time but please bear with me if it’s a little later than usual! Finally, I want to say how grateful I am, not only to our wonderful shareholders, for all the support, but also to the team: @Croesus_BTC , Mario, Sean, @tylev , Albert, Laura, Lily and Alex. SWC is a real team effort, and I am lucky to have the best people working on the mission aiming to deliver our vision for shareholders.",
