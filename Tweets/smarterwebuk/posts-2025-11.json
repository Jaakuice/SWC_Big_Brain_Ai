    "text": "Important message to our shareholders: please take a moment to vote in the upcoming General Meeting - your support truly matters.\n\nMost shareholders hold their stock through a nominee service (e.g. Hargreaves Lansdown or AJ Bell).\n\nVoting is simple: just log in to your broker’s platform or contact them directly. Most now offer quick online voting and it only takes a few minutes.\n\nIf you are coming to the meeting in person and hold your shares through a nominee service do not forget to obtain the necessary paperwork and authority to attend. Alternatively if you hold your shares directly, you will receive documentation by post, which you can bring with you as evidence of your shareholding.\n\nThank you for your continued support. It makes a real difference.",
