    "text": "A busy week for The Smarter Web Company. I will start with a special shout out to Alex who runs the web design side of our business. I could not do what I do on the PLC side of the business without his support. We have worked together for about 15 years and seeing how he deals with our clients is always a pleasure. He picks up everything with our web design clients in a brilliant way. On that note if you are a business owner or a decision maker in your role don’t forget that we offer a high quality, affordable web design solution and this is done with the same ethos as everything else we do. Please get in touch with our team to discuss any web design project. Monday started with confirmation that our new line of stock was trading in Frankfurt with the ticker $3M8.F, enabling easier access to Smarter Web for European investors. On Tuesday we updated the market with our Bitcoin holdings, showing 773.58 Bitcoin held and getting us roughly 75% of the way towards the initial target of 1,000 Bitcoin. Tuesday also gave @Croesus_BTC and myself the chance to talk through questions that people had asked and we did this with a live spaces which was well attended. I enjoyed a few more livestreams on Wednesday with a great chat with @TheBitcoin__ and then later in the day another discussion with @Anders_ . Thursday was the most intense day of the week with a very early start to travel to London. I appeared on CNBC at 08:30 and this was the toughest interview I have done so far. I think that by the end of the chat the host seemed to see more potential in holding Bitcoin on a public company balance sheet. After this it was back-to-back meetings with a variety of different people (and companies) taking me to the late afternoon / early evening event which was organised by Peterhouse Capital. I enjoyed this at it gave me another opportunity to meet a number of #SWC shareholders. The meetings kept going during the day on Friday and I had the chance to meet more investors that I have not been able to connect with until now. With the American markets closed half day Thursday and then also Friday we did not get the excitement of seeing $TSWCF stock trade at the end of the week. As usual the SWC community has been busy. I noticed that we crossed the 3,000 towards the end of the week so as always shout out to @ourgoodlifeuk @BitcoinBee21 @ZynxBTC @the_desert_ape @doublediamond65 @johnsthor1 Towards the end of the week, I was also pleased to be able to put our analytics page live on the website. Jesse and Alex worked wonders on this and over time it will expand to enable people to follow the Bitcoin Treasury aspect of our business with the transparency that I believe they expect. We also added an updated investor presentation to our website which has taken a few weeks to put together (in between other tasks) but I think shows everything that we are doing okay. So the question many of you may be asking is what does this week have in store for us? No spoilers today but we will keep pushing forward, will try and keep it interesting and appreciate the support.",

    "text": "All balanced views by everyone on this topic today. The thing I would add about the #SWC strategy in terms of how we manage the treasury is that everyone needs to appreciate that as businesses scale the additional Bitcoin acquired makes less of an impact in terms of the total Bitcoin and therefore price. Our strategy is less about our average price and more about the long term success of The Smarter Web Company which especially in the early stages is trying to minimise price risks in terms of the ability to raise subsequent capital. If people go back to the start and our early interviews (many were invested and some people did not know us yet) they will see that I have always said that as a business moves through different stages the approach changes. I believe that our strategy is right and also the plan to adapt it over time is right and we will stick to our strategy (as we have done from the start). A Bitcoin treasury strategy within a public company is about trying to get the synergies between capital markets and Bitcoin as right as you can. You can not only see it through the eyes of Bitcoin and what we all believe - you need balance if you are going to benefit from what the traditional capital markets can offer.",

    "text": "Yesterday was 3 months since we listed The Smarter Web Company ( #SWC $TSWCF $3M8.F) in the UK. Yesterday we also announced that we now hold 1,825 Bitcoin putting us as number 27 on the @BTCTreasuries leader board. We also announced our interim results for the first 6 months of this financial year, and I am looking forward to the full year update in around 6 months’ time as that should show the progress we have made with the business and the financials around our Bitcoin treasury strategy. Last week, in the weekly update, I mentioned that we have been making good progress with a few new positions within SWC that we believe will help us on the mission, and we are close to agreeing offers with some of these and others are being recruited for. During the week we have had lots of investor meetings as one of our priorities is attracting major global capital to help us grow the business, inline with our stated strategy. Some of these are quite well advanced and others are just starting and I would like to let everyone know that we aim to move things forward as quickly as possible, but some things take time, and it is important to do them all in the right way. Our X community has increased to around 3,700 members now and although I have been pretty busy this week, I have tried my best to check in and a special shout out as always to @ourgoodlifeuk @ZynxBTC @doublediamond65 @johnsthor1 and @BitcoinBee21 . I would also like to point out a post from @the_desert_ape which I reposted on X last night, and it is amazing to see all the things that we have achieved together in the last 3 months. @Croesus_BTC , @tylev , Sean, Mario, Jamie and Alex have all been doing what they do within the business, and I cannot do what I do without having their experience, support and hard work. Our advisors including Tennyson, Peterhouse, Shard Merchant Capital, Share Registrars and Hill Dickinson are also critical to what we do and I view them all just like our internal team. Please do not forget that you can check the analytics dashboard on our website and it shows many of the metrics that are useful when looking at public companies adopting Bitcoin: investors.smarterwebcompany.… BTC Inc have started to release some of the schedule for the next Bitcoin conference which is being held in Hong Kong at the end of August. I will be speaking and I am very much looking forward to meeting up with many of you. If you are going please say hello and I will aim to take some of our merch to give out. On that note we should have a restock of the SWC merch in around 2 weeks from now, including the new caps, so we will get that on the website to order as soon as it arrives. What does next week have instore for us? We will have to see. I will keep my pledge of mixing things up as best as I can whilst trying to push the company forward. I would like to finish the weekly update with saying how proud I am of what we have created with The Smarter Web Company. To see a business that I set up become listed on the stock market and then get support from so many people is truly amazing. People often refer to the company as “my company” but I view it as “our company” as that is the very definition of a public company. Thank you.",

    "text": "Looking back at each week for The Smarter Web Company ( #SWC $TSWCF $3M8.F) is something that is always fun. It is also quite interesting to compare it to the share price. In my opinion that is the only negative metric this week, as the [fiat] share price is down 29.3%. In contrast we have now become the 25th largest public company holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet after announcing that we hold 1,600 Bitcoin and we completed a fundraising with around £17.5m of new capital. Our analytics page on our website gives you a good overview of the companies balance sheet: investors.smarterwebcompany.… As the CEO I aim to try and do whatever I can each day to improve the company, and I believe that our efforts this week have been fairly good. I am incredibly focused on our mission of becoming one of the largest public companies in the UK. I managed to take part in several interviews and @Croesus_BTC also managed several more. I particularly enjoyed chatting with @JayW132 who I last spoke with right at the start of our IPO process. As we are currently recruiting for several more positions in our company it is worth remembering that a business needs amazing people and a lot of my time recently has been spent interviewing people for a small number of important roles that will help our company grow from here. I will share those “new hires” as I am able to. Our community has grown from 3.4k members last week to 3.6k members this week and one of the things that I do daily is look through all the posts as I view our shareholders as a key part of the team. The comments posted online are very helpful for me to take onboard wherever I can. Shout out to @ourgoodlifeuk @ZynxBTC @the_desert_ape @doublediamond65 @johnsthor1 and @BitcoinBee21 for everything that you all do. Also I would like to give a special shout out to the amazing @AdamBLiv , @Anders_ and @Micro2Macr0 for how you explain what we are doing on your channels - it is always an honour to see you mention SWC. Please note that I do not use DMs on X. If one of the \"fake accounts\" gets in touch with you claiming to be me then please block them. If anyone on X ever asks to speak with me then I always give out our company email address and ask them to email us. You can find our company email address on the contact page on our website. I spent one day in London with some investor meetings, alongside the usual online meetings that happen throughout each week, and we are lucky to have some really supportive institutional investors that have either invested or are thinking of investing and I will keep doing my best on this front. We also published our P/BYD research, and we have other documents that we are working on which we will share over time. We would like to share our thinking on how companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheet can be evaluated by the different people that are interested in them and the P/BYD metric was driven by the conversations that we have with more traditional investors who are more used to the common P/E ratio that is widely understood. Shout out to the FT for covering this; if you ever want to chat then please feel free to reach out to me. Please do not forget that if you own your own business or are involved in commercial decisions in your role and you are looking at a new website that we offer an extremely good web design service with optional marketing packages. There are packages for all budgets. Please visit our website and look at the different packages under the web design drop down or reach out to our team and we can talk you through the service that we offer. Finally we only have a small amount of SWC merch left and this is available to order online. Please visit investors.smarterwebcompany.… to order any merch and I think that it will all be gone in the next few days. I will get some more ordered after this. Thank you for you support as it means a lot to me. We will keep pushing the company forward.",

    "text": "Another week has flown by for The Smarter Web Company ( #SWC $TSWCF $3M8.F). Monday started with two positive news updates with SWC getting to 1,000 Bitcoin on the balance sheet and also the completion of the first tranche of our ATM style subscription agreement which raised £22.9m. Later in the week we updated with a further increase to the Bitcoin holdings announcing a total of 1,275 Bitcoin held and this coincided with Bitcoin starting a move higher. Alongside these updates we announced that we raised a further £10.3m, which we announced on Wednesday. Adding the ATM and subscription together gives £33.2m (before expenses) added to the treasury during the week which is ok as far as I am concerned. On Tuesday I spoke with the lovely @TimKotzman for the first Bitcoin For Corporations Digital Conference and it was good to be able to watch some of the other companies presenting during the day in between meetings. @Croesus_BTC and I have done a number of podcasts and livestreams so over the next few weeks some of these will be released and we hope that you like them. I enjoyed catching up with @ourgoodlifeuk from the SWC community on Friday and its always a pleasure to chat with him. On the subject of the SWC community so proud to see 3.4K members now. Up over 10% compared to last week and shout out to @ZynxBTC @the_desert_ape @doublediamond65 @johnsthor1 . A special thanks goes out to @BitcoinBee21 who had to update the Webley Tracker twice this week. It certainly does need more orange, so I am keen to help on that side of things. Lots of positive feedback from the new investor deck that we released last week and from a personal perspective I have enjoyed using our website analytics to track the Bitcoin treasury part of the business on a daily basis. Don’t forget that you can also buy SWC merch through our website and we have sent a decent number of orders out already. If you have ordered from the website many of these UK deliveries should have arrived by now although the international orders will take slightly longer. Investors do not see all the administrative and operational things that we work on behind the scenes and there are lots of important things we are doing here and as those move to things that we can announce we will do so. We believe in keeping all shareholders updated with transparency. I am truly grateful for all the support from our global investor base and very proud to be the CEO of the UKs biggest public company with Bitcoin on its balance sheet. It's Saturday morning and I am already eager for the next week to start.",
