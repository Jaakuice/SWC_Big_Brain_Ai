    "text": "I bought my first #Bitcoin in 2017 and have bought and sold it numerous times since then. Also used it to buy things (which I think is quite rare especially for todays holders). Also used some of the US stocks ($MSTR & $MARA mainly) to trade $BTC in my ISAs and SIPPs. I hold ~1% of my portfolio in #BTC (HODL) and considering increasing that over the next year.",

    "text": "Lovely waking up to see #Bitcoin above $100,000. Every year I think it is the best asset by far. I buy it, sell it, buy it, etc... Currently I hold ~1% of my portfolio in $BTC & the only way (for me) is to leave it to do it's thing over many, many years. And add little and often. Hard to do but \"this is the way\".",
