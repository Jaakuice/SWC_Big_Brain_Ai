Whatever your political views or wherever you live, I think it's important to remember what they fought and died for - and to protect our freedoms with respect for others. I am fortunate that my grandfather who served was one of the lucky ones - \"Poppa\" to me. Born in 1925, he proudly served as an RAF rear gunner in WWII and later as a police officer. He passed in 2010, aged 85. A true legend in my eyes - still miss you every day, Poppa. We will remember them.",

    "text": "It is time for the weekly update for The Smarter Web Company (AQUIS: #SWC | OTCQB: $TSWCF | FRA: $3M8). Another tough week share price wise but perhaps some possible signs of the bottom being in? I have made a few comments about us trading below a 1 mNAV recently but the bottom line is that sadly that is what the market currently believes we are worth. I disagree. On Monday we started the week with an RNS for our Subscription Agreement (often referred to as an ATM style facility) where we have raised an additional £0.3m. This is a small amount, but the facility was used with restraint. On Monday I also travelled quite some distance on one day – the longest round trip I have ever done in a single day – and that is something important for the future which I will share when I am able. Tuesday saw another RNS released with a small Bitcoin purchase. We added 4 Bitcoin and every little helps. Our Bitcoin Yield Quarter-to-Date sits at 1.74% with just over one month of the quarter complete. This maybe low but it is also pretty good when you compare across the sector. Compounded annually it is certainly not terrible. Wednesday was an enjoyable day. I headed to London and I was interviewed by @RichOnMacro for Trade Live with IG and had some good feedback from our investors following this. Rich is a lovely person and has covered SWC since we started. After this I went to see @TheDCW_JB at the Global Digital Assets Forum. I listened to a few good discussions and keynotes and then presented my keynote titled \"Bitcoin. The Future of Digital Capital\". After this it was a panel with some UK and European Bitcoin Treasury companies which was fun. Shout out to @InvestorSmarter @Boutiquecapital @theretailbull @butler_np @the_desert_ape and any other SWC investors that made it to the event. Thursday and Friday were long desk days. On Friday afternoon @Croesus_BTC and I did a live spaces on X which I always enjoy as we collect the main questions from investors and then discuss - aiming to answer with as much transparency as possible. Although we have ended the week down (fiat) share price wise, looking at the company as a whole, I am confident that we have ended the week in a better position than where we started. This is one of my most important targets each week. The SWC community have been as strong as ever this week. Thank you to: @andysmith_asap @johnsthor1 @JohnCoo70815409 @80IQConviction @doublediamond65 @matthewkerridge @Michaeljdobbin @Boutiquecapital @InvestorSmarter @DrBitcoinM50862 @the_desert_ape @ZynxBTC @wildgoosejon @ourgoodlifeuk @AFCB12 @levyuk and @BitcoinBee21 . Linked to our wonderful community, if you have not yet followed @smarter_dash and viewed the website created, please take a look. This is something created by the community, for the community, and I have had lots of people message me saying how impressive it is. So, what about the week ahead? I have several important projects that are consuming most of my time and the one I can talk about openly is our rebrand. The creatives are looking good and the pages on the new website are taking shape nicely. All the other elements within the rebrand project are getting much closer so perhaps we can launch this before the end of the year. Our other projects are confidential, and I will share with you when I can. I have a few meetings in London at the end of the week along with some media, so I am looking forward to that also. Investing in a Bitcoin treasury company requires a belief in Bitcoin combined with a belief in the management of the company. I am as frustrated as our investors as the market currently attributes no value to our efforts to grow the company, as reflected in a below 1 mNAV. However, I believe that in time, when sentiment improves and / or when people see the value in what we are doing, that we will again attract a strong premium and I am grateful and appreciative for the support and belief that you place in us. We are working tirelessly on the mission, and we are more confident than ever.",

    "text": "Yes, the last few weeks have been more volatile for Bitcoin that most of 2025, but this is the normal rhythm of a young, global monetary asset growing into its role as the pristine digital capital that we believe it is. To state that more accurately, using the data, we are around the 50-day volatility level not seen since we listed SWC in late April 2025 with the current 50-day figure being around 40%. Volatility is simply the price of admission for holding what we believe is the best asset ever created. What’s far more important than short-term price swings is the long-term trajectory: Bitcoin is rapidly becoming a strategic balance-sheet asset for companies around the world. What was once the territory of one and then after this a couple of pioneering public companies has now turned into a clear trend - businesses across different sectors are recognising that holding Bitcoin is not speculative, but foundational. It is becoming an intelligent treasury strategy, a competitive advantage, and for forward-thinking firms, a core pillar of long-term value creation. At The Smarter Web Company, we are proud to be the largest public company in the UK who has adopted Bitcoin as a treasury asset. We are convinced that building a modern company on a Bitcoin-anchored balance sheet is simply the best way to create durable, scalable value in any sector. This isn’t just a niche view anymore; it’s a movement gaining momentum every quarter. Short-term volatility comes and goes. But the future businesses being built around Bitcoin is where the real story lies. And we are determined to lead from the front. This week was quiet in terms of regulatory announcements. We released no regulatory news, but this does not mean that nothing has happened. Since we listed there have been almost 100 announcements which equates to almost 15 each month. As I continuously say some of the things that we are working on take time and will only be announced when we are able to. @Croesus_BTC and I joined a number of different podcasts this week and on Wednesday we also did a X spaces with our community. An interview that I recorded last week with @thebitcoinifa was released during the week and on Thursday I spoke with @TheBitcoin__ live. On top of this, the video that I recorded with @hannahprevett and @dominicoc for The Business - the new weekly podcast from The Times and The Sunday Times - has now had over 10,000 views. Thursday was also Thanksgiving in the US. I greatly appreciate the support from all our US investors, and I hope that you all had good days with your families. A special mention to @tylev and @Croesus_BTC - our two US team members. @Croesus_BTC spoke with @JoinHorizon to talk about the Bitcoin treasury market, hedge fund shorting, PIPE transaction issues and institutional and retail sentiment. I am so proud to have Jesse as part of our team and both he and I are focused on delivering what our shareholders expect into the future. During the week @aw_smarterwebuk has made great progress with our new website and brand project. We hope to be around one week from completion with this now although it will take a little time once ready to go through the appropriate sign off stage before it can go live. With being a public company there is considerably more process than you have in a private business however I hope that everyone will like it when they can see it. I am really pleased with it so far. The SWC community are a core part of our extended team and when reading the posts this week they seem as excited as I do about the future. Thank you to: @andysmith_asap @johnsthor1 @JohnCoo70815409 @80IQConviction @doublediamond65 @Toffeebdm @matthewkerridge @Michaeljdobbin @Boutiquecapital @bitcoin_philos @InvestorSmarter @DrBitcoinM50862 @the_desert_ape @ZynxBTC @wildgoosejon @ourgoodlifeuk @AFCB12 @levyuk @butler_np @Raj_Devsi @Frank54703905 @SmarterBuildBTC @BitcoinBee21 and @smarter_dash . Next week on Tuesday we have the recently announced General Meeting. This is important so that we can update certain aspects of the existing corporate authorities and documentation. The general meeting will take place at Aerospace Bristol, home to Concorde Alpha Foxtrot - the last of the iconic supersonic jets to be built and flown. After the meeting an announcement will be made with the votes and thank you to all those that have voted in advance or are making the trip to attend in person. I also want to say thank you to @LauraStH1991 for organising the meeting; Laura is the glue that holds all the people together at SWC and she has done a great job with this, alongside everything else that she is helping with. Next week also sees the usual variety of things that we have been focusing on progress, and this means that I am one week closer to be able to tell you more on some of this. Until then I am grateful for the patience. This weekend in the Webley household marks the moment the Christmas tree goes up - a timely reminder of how far we’ve come when I compare The Smarter Web Company to where it was this time last year - when the listing process was in its infancy. In just seven months as a public company, we’ve already achieved an incredible amount. Not least as we now hold 2,664 Bitcoin. But investing is ultimately about the future, and I’m excited about what’s ahead. Looking to the future I’m confident we will demonstrate further exciting progress and show our shareholders that they’ve backed a company worthy of their trust and support. Thank you.

    "text": "A volatile week for Bitcoin as I write The Smarter Web Company weekly update. Taking a current Bitcoin price of $84,000 it is down around 33% from the (recent) all-time high. As I posted on my feed yesterday perhaps at around $82,000 Bitcoin, we have seen the local bottom however whilst I cannot see it falling much from the current level the truth is that in the very short term no one knows. For many of us this is normal, but I do appreciate the anxiety that it can cause those newer to Bitcoin. The saying of accepting volatility for performance is harder for many to hear right now. Our share price has also suffered. SWC is an operating business with a Bitcoin treasury, as we believe it is the best asset the world has ever seen. Naturally our share price has been impacted by the recent Bitcoin sentiment. Currently we are valued at below the value of our Bitcoin treasury, so I think that it is fair to say that sentiment is low. Our fully diluted mNAV, available on the analytics page on our website, is currently 0.86. I have zero doubt in Bitcoin as the best treasury asset for a business and I think that the future will prove this opinion correct. I cannot control the markets, but I do control what we do as a company and since we listed our business in April 2025, we have consistently said that it is essential to take the right capital, at the right time, on the right terms. In all sectors, including the Bitcoin treasury sector, I am amazed at the approach many companies take to capital and as both the founder of SWC and a significant shareholder in SWC I am pleased with what we have done, and also plan to do in the future, in this regard. Away from our capital strategies I think we have built a world class team, are developing an exciting operational strategy, we hold the UKs largest Bitcoin treasury (in a public company) and have a very exciting future ahead of us. This week has been quiet in terms of news flow with just one announcement on Monday. This was an update on the subscription agreement (often referred to as an ATM style facility) where we raised a small amount of new capital in the preceding two weeks. This facility has worked well for the company to date, and I am confident that it will work well for us again in the future (alongside our other capital strategies). Before we move onto the rest of the week, I want to talk about the institutional attitude towards Bitcoin in UK capital markets as I see it currently. Ove the last 6 months we have made great progress with explaining the opportunity of an operating business with a Bitcoin treasury strategy to larger investors and we are making steps towards greater adoption. We have also made significant progress with some of the traditional media. There are specific barriers to some institutional investors and a lot of work to do in the future to educate and explain the value proposition, but the attitude is significantly better since we went public in April this year. Despite the market volatility and the lower sentiment, we continue to do the work on these institutional investors, and I believe that we are making real progress. This week, like most weeks, we have had more meetings and whilst they move slower than retail investors the progressive attitude does not seem to have been significantly dampened by the market volatility. On Wednesday I was in London for the Aquis showcase. While it was disappointing not to be recognised for the contribution we’ve made to the exchange in 2025, we remain focused on moving forward as a business. I appreciate the effort some shareholders took to attend the event and it was nice to catch up with a few of you. On Thursday an interview that I recently recorded was released with @hannahprevett and @dominicoc for The Business - the new weekly podcast from The Times and The Sunday Times. You can find the audio and video links for this on my feed, and I really enjoyed recording this. They asked some tough questions, but I felt that they were genuinely interested in the potential of an operating business with a Bitcoin balance sheet and hope to return to their show once we have achieved some of the milestones that we are focused on. I was pleased that I was also able to explain my personal view that people should have some exposure to Bitcoin in their portfolio as I believe that it is financially irresponsible not to have some allocation to Bitcoin through one of the many ways that this is possible. If you have time, please listen to the audio or watch the video. The SWC community has been strong this week despite a challenging week for our share price. Thank you to: @andysmith_asap @johnsthor1 @JohnCoo70815409 @80IQConviction @doublediamond65 @matthewkerridge @Michaeljdobbin @Boutiquecapital @InvestorSmarter @DrBitcoinM50862 @the_desert_ape @ZynxBTC @wildgoosejon @ourgoodlifeuk @AFCB12 @levyuk @butler_np @BitcoinBee21 and @smarter_dash . Next week I am looking forward to catching up with @TheBitcoin__ . This is scheduled for Thursday, and I would also like to take the opportunity to wish our US investors a happy Thanksgiving for Thursday. The week is scheduled to be as busy as usual with the usual mixture of meetings combined work on the projects that I am eager to share with you all. On this note @LauraStH1991 @aw_smarterwebuk and Chris have made amazing progress with our new brand, which includes a new website, and that should only be a matter of weeks away now. I have been thinking for some weeks now about how best to spend my time, given the competing priorities that I must balance, and I love meeting our shareholders in person at the various events that take place but I am going to aim to balance my time at face to face events with more time at my desk. Over the coming months you will notice me much less at in person events so that I can spend even more time at my desk! I think the largest value creation that we can deliver is through execution. Please do not forget that our General Meeting is taking place on 02 December 2025. Some of you are attending in person and I look forward to meeting you. If you are attending, please bring the correct paperwork that you can request from your broker along with photo ID. Voting is important as shareholders own the company so you can also vote through your broker. Please also remember that we recently launched a promotion offering all SWC shareholders a 5% saving on any new web project. Our operating business is something we are genuinely proud of, and we have a clear strategy to grow it over the coming years. If you or your company are considering a new website, we would be delighted for you to explore our work or get in touch to discuss how we can help. Finally, I would like to end by saying how much I appreciate all the support. We are working on several things, and we can only announce these when we are allowed to. The whole team at SWC are focused on the months and years in front of us. AQUIS: #SWC | OTCQB: $TSWCF | FRA: $3M8",

The share price to convert is approximately £2.05. If they do not convert them then they can request 98% of the Bitcoin back - the bond contains approximately 178 Bitcoin at approximately $118,000 per Bitcoin (i.e. they will need to decide if it is better to have the Bitcoin at that price or our equity). That is the only encumbered Bitcoin we have on our balance sheet. We remain confident in Bitcoin denominated bonds as one of the finance solutions for Bitcoin treasury companies.",

If they do not convert them then they can request 98% of the Bitcoin back - the bond contains approximately 178 Bitcoin at approximately $118,000 per Bitcoin (i.e. they will need to decide if it is better to have the Bitcoin at that price or our equity). That is the only encumbered Bitcoin we have on our balance sheet. We remain confident in Bitcoin denominated bonds as one of the finance solutions for Bitcoin treasury companies.",

    "text": "I understand that for those newer to Bitcoin, the recent volatility can feel uncomfortable. Seeing it move below $90,000 has surprised many. That said, volatility is part of Bitcoin’s nature and after a relatively quiet 12 months, it’s not totally unexpected. Of course, we all prefer when that volatility points upward. At The Smarter Web Company, our strategy has remained consistent since our public listing: to grow a strong business while increasing the size of our Bitcoin treasury. We’ve extensively modelled a wide range of market scenarios, and we remain confident in our strategy. Our business is built to prosper over the long term through Bitcoin’s volatility, not despite it. And we continue to believe Bitcoin is the only treasury asset worthy of long-term consideration. Bitcoin only. AQUIS: #SWC | OTCQB: $TSWCF | FRA: $3M8",

    "text": "Another busy week for The Smarter Web Company (AQUIS: #SWC | OTCQB: $TSWCF | FRA: $3M8). The price of Bitcoin remains under pressure - the last few days have been choppy and the sentiment muted. That said, I remain firmly of the view that this is not a crash just below $100,000! Our share price is also under pressure – although we did end the week higher than we started in fiat terms with an approximate 1 mNAV on a fully diluted basis today. The volatility is part of the terrain we navigate and, if anything, the recent flush in Bitcoin and Bitcoin treasury companies may set us up for the next upward leg. Of course this is just my opinion. On Tuesday we launched a promotion offering SWC shareholders a 5% saving on any new web project. Our operating business is something we are genuinely proud of, and we have a clear strategy to grow it over the coming years. Offering shareholders who wish to support the business a direct benefit felt like the right step and if you have a business that needs a new website please take a look at our work or get in touch to discuss how we can help. Also on Tuesday, @RoaringRagnar released his updated Q4 Bitcoin Treasury Yield rankings, which highlight just how challenging the last six weeks have been for Bitcoin treasury companies. I was pleased to see how our yield figures compared against other companies (that I respect) and, in that context, we’re doing okay. On Wednesday it was great to see @saylor feature SWC during the @Official_Cantor conference. Later in the week, on Friday, I was disappointed to see the usual online noise regarding @MicroStrategy and rumours about selling Bitcoin. Completely untrue. It’s unfortunate that people focus their energy on criticising companies and individuals who have done so much for Bitcoin, rather than investing their energy to make a positive contribution to the world. I was in London for media and meetings on Thursday. It’s clear that investor enthusiasm for Bitcoin treasury companies is softer at the moment, but interest is still very much there. We continue to emphasise that this is a multi-decade opportunity. Volatility is part of the journey, and in my view when looking at SWC the entry point today, at around a 1 mNAV, is worth considering. My personal view is that considerable interest will come back to our sector imminently. We also released an RNS on Thursday regarding the upcoming General Meeting - please vote your shares as soon as possible, and if you plan to attend, make sure you obtain the required paperwork from your broker or if you hold the shares direct, bring the documents with you. There will be security on the door. You can find the announcement about the General Meeting on our website, and I am very proud that we are holding this meeting at Aerospace Bristol, home to Concorde Alpha Foxtrot - the last of the iconic supersonic jets to be built and flown. If the venue works well, we will consider using this for future meetings. Our rebrand project continues to move forward at pace. The team have made strong progress, and I’m excited to share it with you all when it is complete. We may well be on track for launch before the end of the year, though getting it right is far more important than rushing it. This is a meaningful step up as we scale up the company. The weekly update is not complete without thanking our SWC community. There are many names that I see that I do not list and each one that contributes helps to make the community stronger. We do not manage this community, and it is 100% independent. Thank you to: @andysmith_asap @johnsthor1 @JohnCoo70815409 @80IQConviction @doublediamond65 @matthewkerridge @Michaeljdobbin @Boutiquecapital @InvestorSmarter @DrBitcoinM50862 @the_desert_ape @ZynxBTC @wildgoosejon @ourgoodlifeuk @AFCB12 @levyuk and @BitcoinBee21 . The community website @smarter_dash has had more updates this week and it is something that I would be proud to have developed myself. Well done those that have worked hard on this community project. If you have not looked at it yet give them a follow and check it out. I have it as one of my saved browser tabs so I use it every day and particularly love the feature where you can view our size alongside all the other UK companies as we aim to be one of the largest companies in the UK into the future. What does next week have instore? It is worth reminding people that despite the markets ups and downs, with more share price downs recently, the company aims to push forward every single week. The share price is the markets current opinion of our value and most of the time (recently) it is wrong. We appreciate that it is hard for some shareholders as externally the share price is a very visible “vote” on our progress, but I hope that through writing these updates each week we can share as much as possible and let you know some of what we are doing. Next week will be as busy as ever with several meetings and the various projects that we are focused on. Midweek there is the Aquis event that I have shared on social media. If you’re attending, I look forward to seeing you there. I’m excited to present our story to people who may be hearing it for the first time - and, yes, slightly nervous to see whether we win the award. I would like to give Jude and the whole team at Aquis a shout out as they have supported us well since we listed. Despite short-term market challenges for Bitcoin and Bitcoin treasury companies, we believe we are building a balance sheet on the best asset the world has ever seen. Building a business on Bitcoin enables us to grow our whole business and I think this will be evident to those that do not fully understand the concept in the fullness of time. For newcomers, the volatility can be unsettling, but it’s precisely what enables long-term performance. We believe we have the right strategy, with significant internal and external catalysts ahead, and we are working as hard as we can to deliver value for our shareholders. I appreciate your support.",

With tweets and rumours like this circulating, it’s probably a good sign the local bottom is in.

    "text": "The standout data item for me this week was the volume traded in our stock over the last week. Taking the 3 different markets and adding them together The Smarter Web Company (AQUIS: #SWC | OTCQB: $TSWCF | FRA: $3M8) volume is at a level where it will be surprising to see it any lower. Special shout out to @levyuk who shares volume data for our stock online, pulling the different trading venues into one bar chart. The market price for our stock also remains at a disappointing level but as a team we focus on what we can impact, and I am optimistic that a more sensible valuation will be applied in due course. As @Croesus_BTC pointed out on X last night in October we delivered a 1.7% BTC Yield and using this single monthly 1.7% data, annualized you would get +22.4% in BTC per share annually. Currently with a 9% discount to NAV (mNAV 0.91) that suggests to me exceptional value. In terms of announcements this week we only had one. On Wednesday we released the TR-1 form supplied by UTXO Management who have been shareholders since our IPO. The TR-1 form confirms they have not sold a single share and when you add my holding to this you can see that just over 22% of the company’s shares are held by notifiable (+3%) holders. Away from the share price, perhaps the most frustrating part of being the CEO of a public company is that many things that we work on can not be shared in real time. During this week our redesign project has picked up pace, and I have had a number of potentially good meetings. However the bulk of the week has been spent on different [potentially positive] things that I am not allowed to share. Thursdays @MicroStrategy earnings call was interesting. It was good to see the time horizons that they talked about and the forthcoming approach to prefs internationally. I posted on Friday about this, and you can read that on my timeline, but the short version is that I agree with their time horizons for new capital, but a core group will always accept higher risk for potential shorter-term gains and the volatility created from this is important. On the international prefs I see this as nothing but positive and was quite surprised by the number of people concerned. In what way is a good company / more good companies expanding bad for the customers? We should be fearful when it is bad companies! I also liked seeing them attach value to the marketing ability as this is something that I think our company has a core strength in. Midnight last night saw the end of our financial year so in several months when we report our full year results the Bitcoin valuation at the end of Friday will be the one that is used in terms of the unrealized profit / loss figure. According to our analytics page we will show a small unrecognised profit but the exact figure in the accounts, when they are released in several months’ time, will come down to the exact data point used. Next week will see another busy week, with a trip on Monday making me cover more miles in one day than I have ever done before whilst also going to sleep exactly where I wake up. I can’t share those details either! And then on Wednesday I am looking forward to visiting London where I have a media interview and then several hours at the Global Digital Assets Forum. As always, the SWC community deserve a shout out. Thank you to: @andysmith_asap @johnsthor1 @JohnCoo70815409 @80IQConviction @doublediamond65 @matthewkerridge @Michaeljdobbin @Boutiquecapital @InvestorSmarter @DrBitcoinM50862 @the_desert_ape @ZynxBTC @ourgoodlifeuk @AFCB12 @levyuk and @BitcoinBee21 . A special shout out this week to @andysmith_asap and @johnsthor1 who have launched a cool dashboard tracking the ATM progress and SWC trades (across all exchanges). For those of you disappointed with recent the Bitcoin performance, which I believe is a key reason why Bitcoin Treasury companies have faced a poor few months, it is worth remembering that historically, Bitcoin’s biggest price moves happen on a very small number of days each year - often fewer than 10–15 days account for most of its annual gains. In my view we are heading into a good end of the year, potentially, and so it will be interesting to see if attention comes back to Bitcoin Treasury companies. I also believe that Bitcoin is getting stronger ever day, every week, every month. Annualised over the last 12 months Bitcoin still shows a ~60% gain which is not at all bad! I appreciate your support.",
