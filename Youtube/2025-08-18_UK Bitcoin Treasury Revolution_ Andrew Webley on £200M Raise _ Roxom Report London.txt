**Host:**
(0:00:00) Um so first up I would love to hear a little bit about um your career trajectory and sort of how and when you discovered Bitcoin and how they uh have kind of moved together over the years.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:00:12) Yeah, sure. So I started my career in 1999. I joined a very small company which became one of the biggest companies in the UK, Hargreaves Lansdown. Um so I did that for 10 years. Um, and then I decided to leave HL and being a developer, I wanted to build a system which I could then build a business around. So I built a content management system which is the same system that we use today to design and build and host websites for our clients. We think it's a very good system, very easy to use, you know, very affordable. Um, and then it got to about almost 10 years ago and I found Bitcoin. Um, and being honest, you know, when I first found it, the significance of Bitcoin didn't quite click. I thought it was a volatile asset, you know, good medium of exchange, these sorts of things.

**Host:**
(0:00:56) How did you find it? Did somebody tell you about it or

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:00:58) Yeah, I can't remember the finer points about how I I found it. And I the only thing I can really remember is that it was really hard to buy at the time. It was before the big exchanges, you know. So what I used to do is I used to have to buy it and then I used to have to send the money um through the bank which was actually easier than it is some of the time today to send it and then you used to get it to I used to use use an online wallet at the time. Um you know completely crazy compared with what it is now. Um I think it was 2017 something like that. Okay. Um, but for me the the defining moment was, you know, going back to my time at HL, you know, I was I was very sort of clued up on the public markets and I'd been investing sometimes well, sometimes not so well. And the moment for me was when Michael Saylor came out with Micro Strategy's Bitcoin adoption. Um, and they basically took a public company and Bitcoin smashed the two together. Um, and for me that was, you know, that was like a lightning moment. You know, it was it was just the best thing ever. Um, and that's when the significance really really clicked. Um, you know, so going back to, you know, the Smarter Web Company, you know, we've always been profitable. Um, you know, we've always enjoyed it. We've got lots and lots of good clients, over 250 clients. Um, you know, it's a good business, just a small business. Um, but what I what I decided was that I wanted to invest in a UK version of Strategy. Um, and there wasn't one, not one that I could find. Um, so this is about two and a half, three years ago, however long it was. Um, and I kept looking every single day trying to find a company that I could invest some of my money in. Um, because I I still hold strategy today. In fact, I bought some more this morning. Um, but I I I I just wanted a UK version of it. You know, there's there's lots of reasons why, you know, that's the right thing in my opinion for someone to want. Um, and I couldn't find it. And then, you know, fast forwarding to last year, um, shortly after the summer, you know, I still couldn't find it. Um, so I decided, you know, probably end of Q3, start of Q4, that I would list my own business. Um, and, you know, here here we are today. We we we started work on that sort of December properly in January. You know, we listed in April this year. Um, you know, I must admit at the time, you know, everyone thought that I was mad. you know, all the people in the city, they didn't they didn't think there was any anything that could be done, even though I was saying to them, look at strategy, look at MetaPlanet. You know, one of our directors is on the board of MetaPlanet, you know, it's it's there for everyone to see.

**Host:**
(0:03:29) Do you think they didn't they they thought that it was such a crazy idea just because of the regulatory landscape in the UK.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:03:35) I'm not sure whether it was so much on the regulatory side. I think the English attitude to I I think the UK capital markets have had such a torrid time for however long it is, 10, 15 years. Um, and I don't think that they they they could see the opportunity to generate capital to do something like this. You know, we've raised um it's probably, you know, give or take around about 200 million pounds, you know, um probably a little bit more than that to be fair. Um or actually maybe slightly less, but call it 200 million pounds. We raised 200 million pounds in three and a half months. Um, and and I just don't think that they they could see the you know, they could see the potential. You know, obviously, you know, I could see it. You know, we're still tiny compared with where I want us to be. Um, but they just didn't really they didn't really get it. You know, the people on on the whole. Um, and then what we did is we wanted to approach it differently to most public companies. So, you know, it's it's a business that I founded. I care about it. I often say that I've got two kids and this is like the one in the middle, you know, so three kids. Um and and and so we wanted to do it, you know, with with hard work, with transparency, with integrity. You know, everyone's seen how hard we've worked as a team so far, you know, to try and get to where we are today. Um and and I think that's one of the reasons why people have supported it because they like the fact that we care about it, you know, we we care about what we're doing. It means something to us. Um you know, and we've done it. Okay. So far,

**Host:**
(0:05:10) absolutely. Um, so I'm fascinated because that you you said that you kind of had this idea around Q3. Uh, it's I speak to a lot of guests who have Bitcoin related businesses and a lot of them have found that since um Trump won uh the presidency and he's got his sort of pro-Bitcoin crypto stance, it's given a lot of people uh the space to grow and develop their businesses knowing that there's guidelines and rules and it's been really beneficial. you kind of were deciding to do this before that and obviously that's the the US and we're in the UK and it's different but I think it's quite bold and brave. Did it feel like that for you or is it like nope this is a good time to do it. I want to do it. It's been done before. Was were there any concerns that you had about doing this in the UK with where we're at?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:05:53) Yeah. So in 2023 um we put on our website that we will accept Bitcoin as payment. Um and that was really hard for me to do. Um, you know, it took me months to actually finally pluck up the courage to put that on our website because when you're marketing a service to small to medium-sized businesses, um, you don't want to scare them when they're potentially, you know, dealing with you. Um, that was a really hard decision and that was only what, two years ago. Um, so when we decided to list the business, I didn't have any doubt in my mind. Um, no doubt, zero doubt. Um and I think part of the reason why I didn't have any doubt was I believe that even in the last 18 months Bitcoin's transformed into something that it probably wasn't perceived as you know 18 months ago two years ago in terms of the you know the adoption you know all I saw last year um coming out of the US which is you know one of the main places that I invest in terms of public markets um was you know the sort of the big money managers over there you know whether it's your BlackRocks or you know Strive or these people saying you know you should have an X% allocation to Bitcoin in your portfolio. So you know I've never seen anything as clearly as this in my whole life. Um of course I may be wrong. Um but I I had no doubt um and funnily enough my wife who was you know a 50% shareholder of the Smarter Web Company with me um and would obviously you know converted those shares into Smarter Web Company shares when um you know when we did the transaction um you know she had no doubt either. Um so um so so yeah two years ago when deciding to accept it as a medium of payment um it was a big deal for us um you know but the IPO you know absolutely no doubt doubt whatsoever.

**Host:**
(0:07:47) Yeah. Um Borja I'm going to hand over to you. Do you want to um have you have some questions for Andrew?

**Borja Martel:**
(0:07:52) Yes of course. Um, first off, I'd like to start uh with a disclosure um because we have to. I'm a shareholder in the smarter web and and as we always say, none of what we talk about here is financial advice. Andrew, um my qu my initial kickoff question for you is um the job that you've been doing, the work that you've been doing so far is absolutely incredible. I think that well I think no the data is that uh you with MetaPlanet are the fastest growing uh treasury companies in in the world today and for everybody that is that is um watching this right now and actually when we posted this we said like hey what what would you like us to to ask Andy um one of uh Andrew one of the um the the best uh or the most asked things was how are we what's what's the plan to uh maintain this incredible rhythm that that you've got. Honestly, it's uh it's it's amazing. Actually, this is something funny. But um I showed some of my friends um in more or less every March April in May May 15th when the company was still at 30-40 million pounds market cap. I was uh showing your company to to my friends and now seeing it close to a billion is insane. So what's the plan um to maintain this rhythm in the UK and how much adoption do you see of most probably the instruments that you must be designing fixed income and so on. How how do you see the landscape in the UK um to absorb uh all all of the liquidity that you want to get?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:09:36) Yes. So you know the the way that we've done it is probably the way to start. So if you want to run a Bitcoin treasury company, you need to start it in the right way. Um, you know, and and and and we did that, you know, we we we involved retail investors, you know, we we started at a a smallish amount and we grew it fairly fairly quickly and fairly fairly frequently. Um, and that's how you do it to compound the Bitcoin yield. um and to you know give the performance you know like we've seen the the reality of what you've got with a Bitcoin treasury company is you need increasing larger and larger amounts of capital um so so the question here is um you know how are you going to do that so take MetaPlanet as a good example you know which I also bought some more shares of on Friday um the the way you do it is that you um you demonstrate to the people that provide the capital that you are delivering a compound Bitcoin strategy, i.e. producing a yield, Bitcoin per share increase, whatever you want to call it. Um, so you know before I came to the interview today, I've been meeting with investors. You know, I've spent a lot of time over the last couple of weeks meeting with different investors in different parts of the world. Um, I've got an awful lot of meetings planned in the diary, even going two months into the future. So that's constant. Um and and the purpose of those meetings is you know fairly obviously is to generate capital the right capital. So that capital can be done in lots of different ways. So you know as everyone knows people can buy our equity you know with it within a raise within you know the market. You know if they buy it within the market they might be buying from somebody selling the shares. They might be buying effectively from our ATM on an update. So that's another thing we do. We've also got something that we announced about two weeks ago called Smarter Convert. Now, that's the first, as far as I'm aware, Bitcoin denominated bond that the UK's ever seen. Um, we've got other things which I'm not allowed to talk about, which we're exploring for the future in addition to the medium to long-term goal of having preference shares when we get, let's say, 10 times, maybe a little bit bigger. Um, that's something that's very, very important, but it's not a today thing. You know, there's a cost to providing those products. the market needs to be a bit more mature until you can do that. Um I think the other angle that you know being completely transparent with everyone that people need to look at is that as you get bigger those capital raising announcements that you make may get more frequent sometimes they may get smaller and they may get bigger. So it's not a straight line. It's not a case of you raise 2 million then 4 million then 8 million then 16 32 64 so on and so forth. you know, as as you get to a certain point, you know, the next raise may be smaller or it may may come from a different instrument or they may be more frequent. Um, if you look at our company, you know, we're still, you know, at 76% or whatever the number is over the last 30-day period. We're still almost doubling the Bitcoin per share over that 30-day period. So, it's still pretty impressive. Um but you know as long as you can keep that you know at a decent level over many many months aka what MetaPlanet can do um you know that's the sort of thing you should look for. The the the trick with it all I suppose um is is is is looking at that profile and and you know our investors saying do they believe that we can continue the progress that we've got and you know that's that's where the work comes in. you know, we work very very long days um trying to get everything done. You know, if you look at um which I appreciate no one can see, you know, what I'm doing at the moment compared with a month ago, it's busier. You know, the Bitcoin per share is greater. You know, the share price is lower. So, you've got all these different dimensions that you need to factor in. But, I've never been as confident about what we're doing as I am right now. Um and I'm very much looking forward to the next couple of weeks and months.
