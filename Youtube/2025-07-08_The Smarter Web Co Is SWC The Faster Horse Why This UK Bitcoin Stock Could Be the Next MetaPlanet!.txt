**Presenter:**
(0:00:00) Hello everybody. So today let me cover one of the most requested stocks in a comment section ever in the history of the channel. I am talking about the smarter web company. So I'm going to try to go fast. Although this is my first Fundamental Analysis time analyzing this company. So keep in mind the more you analyze a stock the more you understand it. This is a preliminary analysis and I'm doing this on an auspicious day, right? Cuz they now hold 1,000 Bitcoin. It's what they've announced and they've acquired that thousand Bitcoin after having been successful at their wave of the UK version of an ATM. And I I won't delve too much into this, but it's it essentially works like an American ATM. and they are able to collect the premium. This is a company that has no debt. This company is not in a debt phase. This company is an in a premium to NAV phase. They are acquiring the premium. They are selling dollar bills for in their case, you know, six $6 roughly or one pound bills into six pound uh uh uh bills. Anyways, there I don't think there's such a thing as a one pound bill. um doesn't matter. The point is so they're trading at a price to MNAV of a six, which is very good because when you trade out of this price to MNAV, you're you're able to collect that premium. You're able to generate that dollar yield and then they turn around and they buy the Bitcoin. Now, this company is is doing it in in in a more uh um timed way. when they acquire of a bitcoin, they have a tendency to keep a little cash on the balance sheet and expand the buys and and time the buys over multiple weeks or at least that is uh my understanding of the chart. They have a frequency in how they buy their bitcoin. They have their own method to the madness. For this analysis, I'm going to assume that of course the cash on the balance sheet will be eventually turned into Bitcoin and probably rather quickly. And of course, if you look at uh Nick's website right here, Kudos Credit where credit is do the the smarter investment guy right there. Kudos. Very very good website to understand this company. Uh in this in this website, right, SWC Bitcoin in this website, right? He assumes the cash is going to buy the the the Bitcoin. And I assume the same thing. The cash is going to buy the Bitcoin. But is it going to be over a 3-we period, over a fiveweek period, over a two week period? I don't know. I have no idea. And we have all the data we need. What's the last data we need? We need the the market cap. And the market cap is going to be in pounds. And it's 751 million pounds is the market cap of this company. So this company has had explosive growth. And one of the big question is is is that is that justified? Is that going to continue? And you know do they have this ability to keep executing like they have because even though this is a new company they have started very very strong after 70 days.

**Presenter:**
(0:02:30) So again this is this this is this is from Bitcoin B21. So again kudos to him for doing this chart. This shows you the speed at which the smarter company, the smarter web company has been able to accumulate Bitcoin and they've been able to do that much faster than even MetaPlanet. And MetaPlanet is one of one of these companies that I love as you know on the on the channel. Well, keep in mind I'm a big believer that there is no second best. Micro Strategy is always going to be number one in my heart. There is no second best. But, you know, as as I try to diversify cuz cuz Micro Strategy keeps doing well. As I try to diversify, I'm trying trying to look for, you know, the second, the third best or or the micro strategy of XYZ country. And that's going to be kind of my take on the smarter web company is that it is the micro strategy of the United Kingdom or the meta planet of the United Kingdom if you want to talk about a sense of scale because the smarter web company realistically it it could catch up to metaplanet I think realistically catching up to micro strategy I don't think anybody's going to catch up to micro strategy but you know of course this is this is a community this is a team I don't actually think Bitcoin treasury companies compete head to head. I think they they they they they cooperate in many ways. I think they give each other tips. It's it's all the same team. It's team Bitcoin because when you buy the Bitcoin, you help everybody in the network who owns the Bitcoin. So anyways, the trajectory is very important. when you when you when you draw out the the trajectory, no no company has had such a strong trajectory on the way up has been able to accumulate Bitcoin at such a speed that that doesn't doesn't exist. At least from what I've seen, their days to cover is something like a 30-day. I'm I'm going to do a slightly different analysis, but the one of one of the big betuh behind the smarter web company is are they going to be able to continue that pace of acquisition? Of course, the answer to that over the medium term is no because the law of large numbers going to kick in. But are they going to be able to acquire still faster than Meta Planet, for example, has been able to acquire? are they going to keep a momentum even faster than Meta Planet? And I think this uh could be a yes.

**Presenter:**
(0:05:00) So instead of using kind of you know there's all sorts of ways to calculate it all sorts of metrics. So so I I'm doing what I'm comfortable with today which is which is a back of the napkin math and I should warn you uh this is extremely conservative. This is too conservative because the number of the number I'm using is I'm using their data from their recent ATM equivalent and I'm I'm I'm using I'm using that data in what I think was mostly their trial phase, right? The 7 million new ordinary shares that they've placed between June 19 and uh what was it? June 19 and July 4. There you go. June 19 and July 4. To me, that was a trial run, right? It seems to me like it was a trial run because they're going to do 14 million and I don't know how long it's going to take them to do 14 million. But if it if it takes them the same amount of time to do 14 million, you can take my numbers and double them. Right? So I'm using the trial period and I'm expanding the trial period over one year to kind of see what kind of upside we could be looking at over a 12 year period. So the market cap of the company 751 million pounds. How much Bitcoin do they have? Well, they have a,000 Bitcoin. A Bitcoin in pound. I'm not used to seeing Bitcoin quoted in in pounds, but a Bitcoin in in pound is 79,800. So, that's let's call it 80 million. Let's call it 80 million pounds worth of Bitcoin. 42 million pound of worth of cash, which will be turned into Bitcoin. I don't know when, but I'm assuming for the sake of analysis that it's already into Bitcoin. So, what do you get, right? You get you get your your market cap 751 million. Keep in mind this is all market cap. There's no debt. So for them market cap price to NAV and enterprise value to NAV for them is the same thing. So you divide that by of course the Bitcoin they already own 79 80 million of Bitcoin they already own. And then um the cash that's going to be turned into Bitcoin. And so I get a MNAV of 6.15. So I calculated pretty much the same as Nick calculates on on his website because he states an MNAV is something like a 6.17. So we get to roughly the same number. So very accretive higher than Metaplanet right Metaplanet is a four. Also I want to point out that right now of course those MNAVs have been compressing. They haven't been as good as they were two to three weeks ago. So so this may be even a bearish tech take for the MNAV. Maybe the natural mnav for smarter web is closer to a nine or a 10. Maybe not a 20. It went past a 20. That's a little high, but maybe it's a little higher than that.

**Presenter:**
(0:07:30) So, using all this data and using this MNAV, they were able to raise 22.9 million British pounds in 23 days. Now, taking a very pessimistic outlook, I'm using that 6x MNAV, knowing full well that they raised at higher prices at some point, right? But I'm I'm I'm trying to be extremely conservative. How much delution does that mean? That means that we sold a dollar for $6. A pound for six pounds is what we sold. So extrapolating that, I take the 22.9 million. That's the proceeds minus the the dilution minus minus what we have to give away, right? Those dollar bills we had to give away. That's so that's 3.72 uh million pounds. So the gain the dollar gain was 19 million. And that was the the again 19 million pounds over 23 days. So per day and I'm using calendar days because that's for the sake of simplicity. This is back of a napkin. Calendar day here uh is £830,000 per day over one year. That's roughly £300 million. So assuming they're able to run this ATM and keep in mind that's the trial phase of the ATM, but assuming they're able to keep this up consistently and assuming the MNAV stays that stays at a six and assuming they do this for one year, what do I get NAV in a year? I get an NAV of 422 million. The market cap currently is 751 million. So if you assume that the MNAV moves back up to a seven and you assume the MNAV is a seven one year from now, then that would mean the market cap would be 2.95 billion. That's roughly a 4x. Assuming one year from now the MNAVs is still a 7x and assuming that trial period of ATM is what they're going to do year round, you're looking at a 4x and then you start assuming compression. So if you do a 5x you're look if you do do a 5x mnav you're looking at a 3x. If you do a 3x mnav you're looking at roughly a 2x and then of course the risk is the mnav getting very very close to a one. Then in that case you would you you would be looking at uh maybe not breaking even in a year. But the big question is do do you really believe a a fast horse like this a fast horse like this can a fast horse like this trade uh trade below one? Well, the answer to that is is it could, but it would be a very big bare market. It would be it would be a 2022 style bare market. At least at least that is my take. It would be a bare market if that were to happen. And and keep in mind even if you were to to to think, oh, it's going to trade at a one or 1.1 or something like that. Well, add six months of ATM, you know, add add a little bit of ATM and then and and and then you will catch up. It's the idea of the spring coiling up. If the valuation doesn't move while the Bitcoin on the balance sheet keeps growing at this rate, at some point you have applying pressure to that spring. That spring is getting coiled and it pops at some point. And that's the nature of investing. We have no idea when it's going to pop. But why is this conservative? Like I said, this is conservative because it seems like the trench they are going through right now is 14 million. So, are they going to move from issuing 7 million shares to now they're going to issue 14 million shares in 23 days? Well, if they do that, you can go ahead and you can 2x my numbers on this slide. And so, all of a sudden, a 7x MNAV in one year would be closer to an eight times your money and not a four times your money. And that's assuming they can keep double the pace of the ATM.

**Presenter:**
(0:11:00) My quick video about it when I was covering micro strategy on Sunday, I called them relentless in their buys. And they have been relentless in their buys. You can go on the website of the Smarter Web company and look at how quickly they've bought the Bitcoin. They've bought a lot of Bitcoin. They are not shy about buying the Bitcoin. They're not trying to be cute. they're not trying to optimize um and wait for the price to NAV to be the most favorable to issue and and unfortunately there's a few uh companies that I follow, Bitcoin treasury companies that I follow who are probably waiting for their price to NAV to spike before they issue new shares and and and of course I am a big believer in the value of delution to capture MNAV in this uh in this type of business and in this type of company. So anyways, the MNAV now it's kind of down in my view was the fair MNAV. Probably a little higher than that if they can keep up this space of accumulation. Probably a little higher than that. And this is more or less what I have to say from from a from a Qualitative Analysis quantitative component. Now there's a qualitative component to the story. Um they they are exhibiting features very similar to what MetaPlanet was ex exhibiting in Japan. You may know Meta Planet was the best performing stock of 2024 out of all of the stock market. Well, you start seeing things like that. Best performing UK IPO ever. Largest stock on Aquis, which is one of the exchanges. Most liquid stock, most liquid stock in the OTC QB, that's another type of OTC. Anyways, in the US, they're most liquid over there. They just launch in launched in Germany. So, I'm curious as to why they as to why they they they did that. But I mean clearly they want to be on Euro Rails. They want to be on Euro Rails. They want to be on USD rails. Uh um this is this is pretty good. You still don't get the reflexivity that you would get say in a meta planet. And and I don't really mean reflexivity but you still don't get that that feedback loop between Japan, Europe and and u and the US. Metaplanet trades you know almost 24/7 because it's traded in Japan. Of course, they are not going to list in Japan. As Sailor says, listing in Japan is something a little too hard for another Japan company. But kudos to them for doing it in Europe. Um, so, so, so, so, so getting exposure to Europe, getting exposure to the UK, and and again, we have the largest UK public company holding uh, Bitcoin and that's the largest by a wide margin compared to coin coin selium compared to what I can say. And so so they've had a start that is perhaps even better than the start of MetaPlanet.

**Presenter:**
(0:14:00) And I will conclude with this and it is is is Conclusion smarter web actually more popular than Metanet among retail. And of course when a company is so small I think retail plays a role in that in that price to NAV and keeping that price to NAV pretty high. For example I would not say that for micro strategy retail plays a role. I would say for for for my for micro strategy well uh uh it's it's it's it's mostly institutions now that that bid up the price to NAV for a small stock uh for a small stock like the smarter web I think retail plays a major role and I want to point out right so Adam Livingston absolutely stunning videos great YouTuber go look Metaplanet Metaplanet Metanet he's covered Metanet multiple times look at the number of views of the Metaplanet videos I found that very striking none of his MetaPlanet videos, which are excellent. None of these Metaplanet videos beat his smarter web company video. His Smarter Web Company video at 13,000 views a video got more view than any of his MetaPlanet videos. So, might that might be a little giveaway that there's something going on with with the smarter web. I also want to show the trends of of smarter web on Google. Now, of course, this is this is all relative. It's a it's a marketer tool may not work for this. The point is in the in the United Kingdom, if you look consistently in the United Kingdom, uh um the smarter web company has been very very close to Micro Strategy and it has been a few times actually above Micro Strategy in popularity in the United Kingdom. And if you look compared to Meta Planet, the smarter web company has been more popular on Google compared to Metanet throughout its history in the United Kingdom. So, I think this is a stock that is catching the attention of the UK retail investor, which is very good because um you you may remember my ALBG video and and I was saying, "Oh, well, it would be a very good idea for the CEO of ALBG to start talking up ALBG uh in France because they don't even seem to have a very big, you know, French retail investor following over there. Um, well, maybe the UK has an investor mindset that is very similar to that to to that of the United States. If you actually look at my channel, these are my channel metrics. Did you know this? My channel metrics. Um, 8.3% of my viewers are from the United Kingdom. So, uh, that's that's very interesting right there. So, there's a lot of capital there's a lot of retail capital in the UK that flows into um into smarter web. Most likely this is very similar to Japan who also has a big retail cohort. Now obviously Japan would not show up on an English-speaking channel but uh but the UK will the UK will so I think they are gaining a lot of traction with the UK investor and so that is for the benefit of the persons who own uh uh who own um um the smarter web company in the US or in Germany.

**Presenter:**
(0:17:30) I will conclude with this presentation and this is this is mainstream UK media. I don't know if this goes on the radio or not. This sounds very much like a radio clip. Um a very very interesting uh um take here talking about how uh in the UK you have very hard time buying Bitcoin. The the banks often times frown on it. They don't like it. They don't allow it. you have to go through a debit card or a credit card and pay fees in order to be able to buy Bitcoin. You're limited in amount. The Bitcoin ETF in the UK is not really a thing. And they specifically talk about Coinselium and talk about the Smarter Web Company. Um, and I was very pleasantly surprised to see Bloom Bloomberg's take on on on British um uh treasury companies, Bitcoin Treasury companies. what was actually a fairly fairly positive one and the the the interviewee they got on there had in my view a really good take on bubbles and and dismissing a lot of the FUD that you find for these companies on Bloomberg UK go believe this or not. So if you are interested in in um in hearing a a UK take you know with a British accent you you could go listen to that. I recommend that. You could go listen to Adam Livingstone. He's great. I recommend his channel. You uh also could go check out the website of Nick, which is a great website and really shows you this. Kudos to uh to Unick for making this website. And you could also go on the smarter web company and just look at their dashboard. They have a nice dashboard and they did a good job as well. So, um I'm I'm fairly bullish on this company. I don't own it. You will know if I decide to know own it or not on the Patreon. I let my I'll let my Patreon uh uh uh members know that. Um but you know, this is one I'm following closely. We we'll have to see what what happens to to price to NAV in the short term. Uh um you know, it could get cheaper in the short term, I kind of hope. So maybe maybe this is what I need to get in. Right. Right. If the if the price drops to a five or a four, you will find that BTT is very very interested in this one. So anyways, this was not financial advice, not investment advice. This is only entertainment. I'm hoping you were entertained. Please like, please subscribe. Follow me on Patreon. Follow me on X. Thank you for watching and have a wonderful, wonderful day.
