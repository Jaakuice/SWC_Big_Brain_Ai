**Anders:**
(0:00:00) Morning and good evening to UK. Uh welcome to uh Bitcoin Treasuries World number 56 for a Smarter Webley Wednesday on a Monday. Why not? I do have to just show off my new favorite Bitcoin merch. Um— does that show all of it, Andrew?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:00:18) Yeah, I can see it.

**Anders:**
(0:00:20) The Bitcoin the Bitcoin logo with the British flag in it or the the Union Jack. Gorgeous. Thank you so much for that, Andrew. And thank you to your son for sending it over. Uh welcome to the show and how are you doing?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:00:32) Yeah, I'm good. It's um it's been quite an intense period the last couple of weeks for us. Um and you know a week ago we were able to share the you know the exciting news that we've been been working on and then um since then we published our prospectus uh that came out on Friday. Um and then this morning we announced our uh Bitcoin Treasuries Unconference that we're doing. Um you know which you know we're quite excited about as well. So um yeah it's been it's been busy and I'm hoping that we're at the start of a very very busy period for you know the company and Bitcoin treasuries in general.

**Anders:**
(0:01:12) I I think we could be and um I couldn't agree more. It's it's it's busy and definitely exciting. It does seem that sentiment is coming back a little bit. So um all of us shareholders have been excited about the future uh London Stock Exchange uplisting and and uh then you announced it Monday that this application is in. Can you help us understand um uh you have applied and what what what is um how sure are we that you will now uplist in in in February? Is it February 3rd or 4th— third or fourth um— or and what— what does it look like for for you guys?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:01:48) So, probably the best way to answer that is to talk about the process because it's quite an interesting process if you've never been on on on that process. Um, so if you're a company um that may be listed already on a different venue like ourselves or or not listed at all, um you can decide that you want to um list your business on the London Stock Exchange um and then start the process. Um there's certain eligibility that you need to um comply with. Um so there's a minimum value of the business, you know, which crudely speaking is the market cap. Um, and then of course there's costs for this. Um, you know, there's there's there's an awful lot of work that goes into this process. Takes many months. Um, and so, you know, because of those two things, it's it's only suited to businesses of a certain size. Um, so because we are a quoted company on Aquis today, um, there's there's things that you can say and things that you can't say. Um, and even if you're a private business, you know, the— you you you shouldn't really announce certain things until a certain point in the process. Um, with the advice of our advisers, we decided that we wouldn't say anything other than, um, that it was an aspirational goal of ours, knowing that of course we were working on this process. Um, and and then you get to a certain point at which you've got enough confidence and your advisers have got enough confidence um that you can tell the market about it which is exactly what we did um you know a week ago. Um and we also um called a general meeting um to allow us to uh manage the time scales around the leaving one market and joining another market um which is exactly what we did. Um and then after that um you get approval um all being well um from the FCA um which is our regulator um of your prospectus which is a a legal document and I'm ever so proud of that document. Anyone can have a look at it from our website. Um and and that sets out what you what you do as a business, what you want to do as a business, your financial position, corporate governance, you know, all of these things. Um and and that gets published. Um and then there's a few more things that happen um um you know as that timetable unfolds and if you if you look at the timetable in the prospectus it it says that our first day of trading all being well on the London Stock Exchange will be Tuesday the 3rd of February which is two and a half weeks um I think from where we are— two two weeks actually maybe something like that. And and and and then you get to that point um you have um what's called an opening ceremony. Um, which is where, um, we're still trying to work out the numbers that we're allowed actually on on on that. We're we're— hopefully we'll have that tomorrow. Um, you invite some people. Um, it's not quite as large a number as I thought, but you know, as I say, I'm still trying to work that out.

**Anders:**
(0:04:42) Um, and you have the the whole crew there. Yeah.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:04:45) So, um so that's what we're working on. You know, uh you know, the people that aren't in the UK, Tyler and Jesse, they booked their flights. Um you know, Laura, who who's part of the team, she's sorting out the um the travel for the rest of us uh later this week. Um so, yeah, all all systems go, all being well. Um until something's done, it's never done though. Um I think everyone needs to be mindful of that. Um but you know getting to the point at which you've got a FCA approved prospectus which is published is is a significant milestone and and it's great for us because you know we we we we've been very very limited on what we're able to say. You know, we've only, you know, knowing that some weeks we've worked incredible hours, you know, all day, every day, um trying to to get everything in the position that's possible because rightly so, um from the advisers and the FCA, um you know, everything is looked at in in incredible detail. So, you know, it's it's nice to be able to say that um and to to share that news with you know, ultimately the owners of the business, i.e., our shareholders.

**Anders:**
(0:05:55) Yeah. No, absolutely. So, um, what I noticed you said it it is FCA approved, so it's it's— I guess it's kind of limited what could get in the way of of this happening. And you're saying you're already booking flights and— right, although nothing is guaranteed, I should say, which is correct. And it's like that with with everything.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:06:15) The the one thing that I I do think is great is if you look at our prospectus, you can see that if you look at the definitions which is at the back of the document, you know, we've been allowed to say things like Bitcoin yield, MNAV, you know, these things that when we listed on Aquis, we weren't allowed to say. Um, so, you know, for the wider Bitcoin community both in the UK and globally, um, you know, we've done a very good thing with this in my opinion, um, in in terms of trying to push things forward a little bit. Um, and, you know, it's really cool, um, that, you know, we we we've been able to, you know, take things to a more advanced level than, you know, we were able to do, you know, 9-10 months ago, whenever the the that IPO was. Um and I don't see that changing you know as as time goes on and things get more accepted um you know the model can evolve and grow um institutions become more receptive over you know this type of um company um you know i.e. an operating business with a Bitcoin treasury strategy. Um, and I think it's just positive for the world in general. Um, you know, but clearly I'm pretty biased because I'm very supportive of the Bitcoin treasury scene.

**Anders:**
(0:07:32) Me too. Absolutely. Hashtag me too. Um, yeah. And um um you mentioned also— so it it obviously um— well by the way— no uh so the thing you mentioned that uh the fact that you can now use words like BTC yield etc. I was listening in on your conversation with James last Wednesday and um and and and heard you you saying that as well and definitely that's positive for for for treasuries— is positive for Bitcoin. It's— and what's good for Bitcoin is good for humanity. So um it's all steps in the right direction that we want to go. Um, you did mention that obviously this this is costly to to list on on on the primary number one stock exchange in the in the country. And um I noticed you were able to run the um the ATM or maybe that's not exact you know legal or technical term for you guys but but people know what it means— selling shares at a premium and raise funds advantageously um compared to the to the balance sheet. Um so so you did that and I noticed that um so now your your yield um for Q1 as we just started in January became a little bit negative and that's obviously because you've raised now uh pounds that you have sitting and is that as a payment for um for the uplisting or is it to create a buffer because we also know early December you um you you got the vote approval that you can now buy back shares. Is it for a buffer in a situation like that? If MNAV goes low, then you can buy it up and that's accretable— or or or what is the the use intend for for the funds you raised?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:09:15) Yes. So, um there's there's two things to say there. Um you know with with the disclaimer that you know we can only talk around what's in the prospectus and publicly available information. Now the first thing to say is in our prospectus you can see the cost of our uplisting is approximately 1.5 million pounds. Um you know on one hand that's a lot of money. Uh on the other hand if you look at you know the the movement that we've had in our share price um since we announced that news you know it's it's created a lot of value. Um, what I'd urge people to do is is to have a look at other London Stock Exchange prospectuses, you know, and see. So, there was there's— there was a company that listed towards the end of last year called Princess Food. Um, I looked in their prospectus. Their listing fees were I think 10 and a half— 11.5 million pounds. Um, so what I'd like people to understand is that clearly when you're a public company, there's there's certain costs. Um, but you know, we run a very very tight ship. Um, and I always push for the hardest deal possible. Everyone that knows me in this space will will know that we we always try and do— drive quite a hard bargain. Um, and and I'm delighted. Um, I haven't got any any data that says that we're the, you know, the the cheapest um, you know, admission to the main market or anything like that, but be quite surprised if there's that many others that are, you know, anything like what we've paid. Um so that's that's the first thing to say and that's public information that's available in the prospectus. Um the second one which is more a direct answer of your question is that um we announced— so when the prospectus was being finalized we we needed to ask the ATM operator for the precise number of shares that been sold which is why there was an update midweek um as opposed to a Monday which is you know as we intend to announce moving forward um and and and you're right that the proceeds of that was you know 1.7 million pounds. Um, and because we then added those shares into our analytics to give a meaningful um, representation of the fully diluted shares at this precise moment in time. Um, but then we held the cash in the business or hold the cash in the business depending what we're going to do with it. Um, it does create a slight negative yield— less than 1%— in in the current quarter to date. So, what I'd say to everyone is you, you know, we're trying to build the business for the medium to long term, and we've got a range of options in front of us. Um, buying Bitcoin, um, holding cash, holding more cash than we've held in the past, using some of it towards the uplisting costs. Um, people can see the the the the cash based on the numbers that are in the in in the in the document anyway. And obviously, there's been raises after that point. Um, so I can't give you a straight answer on that, as much as I'd love to. Um, but I'm incredibly confident about what we're going to do in this quarter, um, this year, um, and for future years. Um, you know, I'm really proud of the record that we've had historically, but I'm not allowed to give you a really straight answer because that might be giving you information before we release it to the market. So I would just say watch this space and and we believe that we've got the right strategy for you know the short term, the medium-term and the long term. Um clearly all of our um objectives um is making the business as successful as it can be and and one of the metrics that we use for that is the Bitcoin yield. And we do look at it on a quarterly basis. Um, so I'd be pretty disappointed um if it if it was negative in a quarter ever. Um, not saying that that technically it it may be that it's negative for some quarters, but you know, I I'm certainly not not not planning on that.

**Anders:**
(0:13:05) Yeah, by no means um is that my expectations. It's uh— as an investor awesome to see that the stock is back uh above 1.1 MNAV. I think uh we're even closer to 1.2 now. Um and um— go ahead.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:13:22) What what's worth remembering as well is— so I don't know whether this is the same with other Bitcoin treasury companies but with our company what happens is we sell some shares, we get some cash, and at that point you reduce the SATs per share— you know, Bitcoin yield, whichever metric you're using— because um you've effectively increased the share count and you at that point you haven't bought Bitcoin with with that you know or used it for other purposes. And then when you buy Bitcoin, you don't necessarily create a positive yield, but you increase in theory the Bitcoin per share because those shares are already in the count. Um, so there's always going to be— and you can see if you look closely at our graph, you can see a moment and then it it it changes. So, um, you know, what I can't tell you right now is whether you're talking like hours or or a little bit longer, you know, for that um for that thing to happen. But, you know, I— you know, we've asked our shareholders for an awful lot of late um because clearly the the price action um until this year has has been hard for everyone and it's been very difficult not being able to say certain things. Um but you know, if we can ask something else of our shareholders, it's to please understand that we are working almost every hour of every day to try and make the company a success. And you know, we— there's not been that many things that we haven't delivered reasonably well historically. So, you know, perhaps that that delivery sort of record will continue. And and and that's certainly what we're trying to do.

**Anders:**
(0:15:02) Yeah. And I think, Andrew, that uh those of us who survived the the Q4 bare market um are very uh bullish on on uh Smarter Web, medium, and long-term. And probably a lot of us including myself also um short-term with with an MNAV at at a at a place where it's actually positive to uh— possible to yield now and and um so so things um uh are looking uh very good and we've had a great January so far and very excited about obviously um this uplisting. So that's the awesome thing.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:15:38) Um— sentiment and the model over a period of time which you know people you know need need to understand is that in our opinion what you'll have with Bitcoin treasury companies is that there'll be periods where they're not loved and there's periods where they're loved and there's periods where there'll be you know extreme fear and there's periods where there'll be you know extreme happiness. So, you know, it's like a wave, you know, of of sentiment which which we believe corresponds, you know, to effectively— and um because when when no one's interested, you know, maybe they don't appreciate the, you know, the longer term and obviously this improves over time, you know, the the yield that you've managed to deliver— the Bitcoin yield. Um, but you know, it it was, you know, our, you know, sort of working theory, if you like, that sentiment will improve. You know, I've been investing for 25 years— for Bitcoin— in Bitcoin for almost 10 years. And you know, in any investment, you get periods where, you know, everyone hates it or everyone loves it. Um, and then the other metric that you need to understand around that is, you know, the ability of a company to raise capital. Um we've demonstrated to people that we can raise reasonable amounts of capital in a variety of different ways whether that's Smarter Convert, placings, ATM— in the future other things perhaps— um and and and you need to understand those two variables— so the ability of the company to raise capital um and then the sentiment side of things and um you know and that's why in our opinion we're getting into a very exciting time again now um you know don't forget with the Bitcoin treasury company if you if you've got the ability to raise capital and sentiment improves further than where it is at the moment. So you know you go from like a— this isn't a projection— like a 1.2 to a 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 MNAV, you know, the the accretive nature of that higher MNAV gets mega exciting. Um, you know, and and and that's really really important. And then if you look at what we've been doing when things have been tough is you know we we— with with our um you know sort of proposed move to the main market of the London Stock Exchange we— you know in theory there's there's a much greater access to capital— not only the um the active money but the passive money as well— you know that's indexes and things like that. So structurally, we believe that we've got the right um company with with a a decent balance sheet that's going to get stronger. Um so yeah, I you know, couldn't be more excited about the future right now. Um and and and I'm I'm really hoping that we're right so that you know the shareholders that have stuck with us through the you know the the the less good times can can can see that how we've structured the business is is is is right you know whilst there's never any guarantees.

**Anders:**
(0:18:28) You you touched upon something which was actually my my next uh question Andrew and that was um the index buying. So um Bitcoin basically just needs to go up somewhat and and and while you being on the London Stock Exchange that will be automatic— not political but automatic— inclusion in Footsie 250 eventually um with the growth of Bitcoin and and a positive MNAV and yielding and everything um eventually it becomes Footsie 100 and that's all passive index buying that obviously helps your situation because that will be just buying shares and that's one of the main drivers of of buying more Bitcoin when you can sell those at a premium. But also— so my question is will you already um if you have this MNAV— or sorry market cap— that you have now and you get uplisted in February um is that enough to be included in the the small cap index which is you know so outside Footsie 250 but just like the general smaller companies in in United Kingdom. Um, so passive buying from that, how is— is that something that could be triggered already from when you uplist?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:19:35) Not from, but very very shortly after we believe. Um, so the way it works in the UK um, for the main market is you've got the Footsie 100 and then you've got the Footsie 250 and you add the two together and you've got the Footsie 350. Underneath that you've got the Footsie Small Cap and then right at the bottom you've got the Footsie Micro Cap. Um so that's the index structure if you like. Um the Footsie All Share is the Footsie 350 and the Footsie Small Cap added together. So in theory um you know a company the size of ours um wouldn't quite be big enough for the Footsie 250 um but we would be big enough for the Footsie Small Cap and the Footsie All Share indexes. So that's sort of size. Um and then how do you get into these things? Well, it's a simple case of time. Um so I believe that the— so these are quarterly reviews. Next one being March. I believe that there's enough trading days between the 3rd of February um and and when the indexes next get reviewed to allow us to get into um those two indices um i.e. the uh Small Cap and the All Share um in March, end of March. So, I don't know that for a fact. Um and then what I'm hoping is that we have a really really good couple of months and then, you know, we'll be big enough maybe to to, you know, take our position in the Footsie 250, which would be great because then that would be just over a year of the life as a public company. Um and and to get into that sort of index then would would be great. Going back to the um the subscription model that we've got which a lot of people call an ATM facility um the reason why that is such a good facility or one of the reasons is that it scales brilliantly um so it it scales fantastically well alongside the other capital strategies that you can use um so if you've got a stock that's liquid um— now there was an article in a paper called The Times on Saturday in the UK. Um, and I don't know the date range that they were talking about. I guess it's somewhere between a month and three months, but I genuinely don't know. It might be longer. Um, but it doesn't matter because the date range is the same for everyone in that article. And they had the top 10 shares sold by retail investors and the top 10 shares bought by retail investors on both markets combined. And and we were position 10 for the buys. We weren't in the sales. Um this was done by value not number of shares. Uh the next one above that was a company called Marks and Spencer's which is pretty big shop in the UK. And then you had things like you know Rolls-Royce and probably Lloyd's Bank and I don't know what the other ones were but basically the 10 biggest stocks bought by retail investors over that time period. And and and so we've definitely got liquidity in our stock which is great. Um, so if you add all those variables together, you know, size and liquidity and then you overlay that with structure of a company in terms of its value of listing. Um, it's quite exciting.

**Anders:**
(0:22:45) It's very exciting, Andrew. And I'm becoming again more bullish when I'm um talking with you. And there's a couple of different things um that is coming to my mind that I'm writing down. One of them is— so there's there's a couple of different treasury companies in in UK as there are in many markets— in many markets. Um um Jesse has said earlier that um um that it's a— for treasury companies is a winner takes most— which I absolutely agree with. You know, the biggest having some advantages in accruing more Bitcoin and creating that yield and and now we're seeing you getting access to some indexes which you will be the only treasury company having that further assistance which— considering obviously making this stock more attractive which should attract more buyers which justifies a premium bigger maybe than others. That again also just means that the machine in terms of creating yield runs faster. So it— I mean it's very bullish I would say for SWC. Also I think we have to remember what the— because now you mentioned the different indexes and thank you for clarifying that. It just makes me more bullish— what the QQQ inclusion did for MSTR. I think it was one of the most bullish uh periods at the end of Q4 24 when— and we knew that Strategy was going to be um— become part of of QQQ— all that front running— all that did wonders for the stock. Combining that with if we just all think back three, four, five, six months, we do know that when a treasury company is smaller um then the yield numbers easily becomes a lot higher. So the the value growth for the shareholders is higher. So your yield numbers were several hundred percent um during during the summer of of of last year. That's— I think that's a good reason to be quite bullish for you in the coming period of time.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:24:42) Yeah, but I I don't disagree with that. The the thing that you've got to remember is the reason why our numbers were so good last year is because we were so good at raising large amounts of capital. Um, so you're right that if you're a small Bitcoin treasury company, um, and you can raise increasingly large amounts of capital, you can generate one hell of a yield, which we did before and will, all being well, do again. Um, so that's the first thing to say. Um, the second thing to say is that there's lots of different models, you know, and and this is a great thing, you know, so, you know, I'm supportive of any company, private company, public company that wants to buy Bitcoin. Um, and you know, we've got our strategy that we've executed to date. Um, and um, we'll continue to do that and I hope we'll continue to do that well. But there's other companies out there that have got different models. Um, and I'm loving seeing what some of these different companies are doing, which is one of the reasons why we've decided to put on our Bitcoin Treasury Unconference UK because, you know, we want to um showcase what these different people can do in the UK and let them talk about their models, you know, whatever they may be. So maybe generating uh operating profits at scale um and deploying them into Bitcoin and then that creates a yield with less dilution perhaps um or maybe you know doing doing whatever they're doing um you know to to do that. So, you know, I I think what I'd like to see this year, other than us basically smashing through the Footsie 250 on route to the Footsie 100, um, is I would like to see, you know, lots of companies doing different things well. Um, and there probably is a winner takes most, um, you know, sort of thing that that's happening, you know. Um, and that's okay. Um, but then there's room for lots of other companies. You know, as long as people are doing what they believe in and they're doing it well for the benefit of their shareholders, then you know, it's a very very positive thing. Um, and you know, I I I'm looking forward to seeing what lots of the other companies, you know, in the UK and internationally um can do over the next few years. You know, I'm I'm so focused on Smarter Web because, you know, obviously, you know, it's my job. It's the company that I founded and I absolutely love what we're doing and I believe in our strategy, but you know, just as we've all got different opinions in the world. You know, there's loads of other things that people might be able to do with Bitcoin on their balance sheet, which could be really, really cool. Um, and and and I think that's brilliant. It's good for Bitcoin. It's good for the UK capital markets. It's good for the world. Um, and and so I'd like to see more of that.

**Anders:**
(0:27:18) Absolutely. Um and okay, so I'm getting in the chat that um they are getting the feedback. I don't know if I'm on speaker um— computer and I may not um be um um— but I don't know if you can mute me when I talk or maybe a better solution is just that I don't say too much Andrew— to hear you talk. So I I'll try and limit um my speaking. Um but uh I mean to sum it up personally very bullish on um— Okay, the feedback is gone now. Did you did you mute yourself when I'm talking or—

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:27:48) Okay, thank you.

**Anders:**
(0:27:50) Appreciate it. I think the people out there appreciate it as well. Um so I think 2026 does look like a a very uh bullish year for SWC and other uh treasury companies. Sentiment seems to be coming back. Um what's left to discuss is um you know the outlook of Bitcoin itself in 2026. I I I would claim that the 4-year cycle is still intact. It hasn't been um broken yet. However, I also did a video last spring, I think, when Strategy announced the different prefs— where that if they get enough buy volume on those, that in itself will create such a buy pressure— and we're seeing it also now from Strive and also from MetaPlanet— that that in itself might remove a bare market year. It it it could just uphold the price, I think. And we're seeing a lot of um volume on stretch— and and uh just recently I think uh Strategy announced 15,000 Bitcoin bought in one week. So I think that is now so much— it looks positive for Bitcoin itself. But but what's your thoughts on on the cycle and and you know potential bare market for Bitcoin and and all this buying that is now happening uh based on prefs themselves?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:29:05) So, my opinion is that the four-year cycle is probably a thing of the past. Um, largely anyway. Um, and I think one of the main reasons for that is that the scale of the buying from— well, I'd like to say Bitcoin treasury companies, but Strategy's been pretty much doing it for everyone for the last three months because most Bitcoin treasury companies haven't been buying that much Bitcoin. Um, but hopefully some of them starting very, very soon. Um so so I think that sort of adoption side of things— I think you know if we look back at the last couple of years there's been a lot of talk um about the institutionalization of Bitcoin and clearly that's been happening. I think this year that will continue. Um I think the thing that sort of causes a bit of an issue um with um Bitcoin which is natural as as something becomes sort of more established is you know the sort of the the paper Bitcoin and I don't mean the paper Bitcoin that sometimes people call Bitcoin treasury companies. Um but I mean the paper Bitcoin in terms of the people trying different option strategies um against Bitcoin you know to sort of squeeze out you know you know a percent, 2% whatever a month um you know I'm not a big fan of those but clearly it's just part of a market as it becomes bigger. Um I— above all of that though I think that at the end of the day if you zoom out a little bit and you look at you know an increasing adoption of a fixed supply asset I think providing the thesis of why people buy that asset is still true and and and growing which it clearly is in the case of Bitcoin then I think it's a fantastic asset to hold as a— in our case as a treasury asset or in an individual's case to protect themselves from, you know, the debasement of the fiat currency. Um, I'm not 100% sure, if I'm honest, why gold and silver have had such a good 12 months and Bitcoin hasn't had a better um period. Alongside that, if we look back at history, you know, you could make a case for, you know, when that plateaus out um which it may or may not do, then that's when Bitcoin rips. Um, but we're just going to have to wait and see. I'm personally, as much as it's um, you know, probably not the thing that people want to hear, I'm actually quite glad that Bitcoin recorded a a very very small down year last year, um, because I think that removes some of the narrative. Um, because if it if it hadn't recorded that and let's say it closed up like 1% positive or something, I think that all year this year we'd have everyone saying that it's going to be a down year, you know. So, um, I'm quite glad about that. As much as, you know, it's it's, um, you know, not what everyone wants to hear. I would say also that if you look back at our company, you know, clearly building a balance sheet on on on Bitcoin, um, you know, if we look at last year and we think that yes, there was a period where it was very very tough on the share price. But if you look at the Bitcoin per share or any of those sorts of metrics, you know, you know, we achieved a lot in a year that wasn't great for Bitcoin. Um, so let's assume that this year is a good year, which is what I believe it will be for Bitcoin, then you know, things could get incredibly interesting um for Bitcoin treasury companies. So um yeah, I'm pretty pretty bullish about um the the near-term potential for our treasury asset. Um you know, and and clearly over the medium to long term, you know, it's um it's looking pretty good, too.

**Anders:**
(0:32:35) I I I would agree and I think uh in particular your situation now amongst the different treasury companies uh with this uplisting which is likely to take place— but not guaranteed— uh I would say probably very likely— um then your situation in particular with the passive buying coming from the indexes as as we spoke about before I think looks um super super bullish. Do you plan to— now we we know— well Strategy has created quite the the cash buffer like in the billions of dollars. Um MetaPlanet to some extent as well. There's there's others as well. I know Orange went public with a cash buffer. Is is that something you're planning to build bit by bit maybe going forward? Is that something you're you're thinking about?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:33:22) Yeah. So, we've always kept some cash in the business. Um, so we're an operating business that creates a little bit of cash. Um, and then also we hold some back. Um, clearly our costs have gone up as we've become a public company, not just because of doing the uplisting, but as the team's grown out, you know, people will see that we've recruited more non-executive directors, you know, and and and I think people should want to have really good people in a company, you know, particularly as it gets bigger and bigger to um make sure that everything's being done, you know, to the best possible way. Um, it's a false economy, not having the best people. You know, in the UK we have a saying where if you pay peanuts, you get monkeys.

**Anders:**
(0:34:02) Um, but I think that's global.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:34:05) That's global. Yeah, probably it is. We won't claim that as a UK saying then, so we don't upset anyone. Um, but you know, we we we clearly do have costs and you know, that's all clearly stated. Um, and we've clearly kept enough cash. My personal opinion um is that I I believe maybe um— so I thought a lot about why did we trade you know our worst— like a 0.7 MNAV— um and the two things that that could have been in my opinion is one is a lot of selling you know obviously um alongside sentiment not being great with Bitcoin and Bitcoin treasury companies but I do think that probably part of that was the market not thinking that we had a large enough um cash position for the future where I couldn't come out and say look we've got cash for you know X period of time um but I do think that if we could say to people right you know we've got cash for this period of time— which which is different you know to you know when we IPO'd there was a lot of people having a go at me for deploying the cash too slowly um and I think a lot of those people— included some quite big names— have actually, you know, turned and come around to my way of thinking. Um, so, so yeah, like you know, when you're a public company and you've got costs— in the same way that if you're an individual and you store all your money in Bitcoin, clearly there is an advantage of having a little bit of cash— for as an individual living and as a business surviving, you know. Um, the worst thing that you can do as as an individual or as a public company is to sell your Bitcoin. Um, and you know, I don't think, you know, I've not been worried about that as as as a business ourselves, but I think some people have been worried about that. And perhaps that's one of the reasons why we traded at that, you know, pretty ridiculous level towards the end of last year. So, so yeah, I I I would like— we we don't need to have a cash buffer the size of Strategy's because clearly they've got a cash buffer for um you know the the the dividends on the prefs, you know, but I think I'm not 100% decided on what the size of that cash buffer should— we've been discussing it as a as a board and a team to try and make sure that we come up with the right number. Um, but I think it's quite sensible, you know, but you know, you don't really want to hold cash for too long because ultimately that cash is going to be devalued to whatever your your favorite rate of inflation is every single year, you know. So, but I I think that we'll— with with what we're doing, we'll we'll get the right balance there. And I hope that that will be one of the things in addition to a longer track record that will show people in in a future, you know, less positive stage that, you know, that we're a safe place to stay invested. Um, you know, notwithstanding for the fact that you'll always get volatility in a model like this.

**Anders:**
(0:36:58) Yeah, for for sure. Um you mentioned how you were trading at a very large discount in in December which I also noticed and I I did some uh— which I'm still I guess in the process of— tax loss harvesting. So I quadrupled I think my SWC size right around MNAV 0.8 date and it's great to see now that um with a likely— the likely uplisting and then uh as I'm learning from you now— we are learning— it likely index buying um starting from March already um I guess that might be part of the reason that we're we're seeing the the stock having performed really well uh lately and it becomes that positive spiral where it's now trading at at a premium where um running the ATM is is uh technically uh possible and and viable which then further reinforces the stock performing well and it it just does seem like SWC— like MetaPlanet you could argue as well for sure— is is over the worst and it seems that's behind us and and it seems like we're back in a territory where where the machine is is um is running um for selling stock at a premium and thereby uh accreting more Bitcoin for the the existing shareholders. So I'm I'm um increasingly bullish um for SWC and looking looking forward to this year. I think it's going to be very interesting.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:38:25) One one of the great things that you've potentially got is that you'll always get people front running stuff in a market. So if you think about the potential catalysts on the horizon for us, you know, you've got um the move to the the main market, you know, all being well. Um then you've got you know the smaller index inclusion, then you've got the larger index inclusion— you know you've got all these things at different points in time. Um and then if you overlay that with the capital raising strategies that we've got you can see that you know you create this sort of momentum. Um and then you know if we can be fortunate enough for Bitcoin to get that momentum alongside all of that— you know i.e. where we store our treasury. You know, things can get very very exciting very very quickly because if you go back to the the equity side of things, there'll be certain people that cannot buy at certain points. So there'll be index funds for example, they cannot front-run it. So you'll get other people front running it, push the price up, then the index people buy it, you know, obviously they buy it, some people sell out of it. Um but you know as long as it's sort of net um you know uh positive in terms of you know more buying than selling um then then you just create this sort of perpetual um you know movement and you know it's it it it's quite mind-blowing when you think about it too too much. Um what I try and do— because obviously we talk about this and you know going back to you know uh I don't know the the end of Q3 start of Q4 we were we were doing a lot of analysis on the on the indexes and thinking right what could this mean for us at these different points and you know you know all those sorts of things and um yeah you know it's it's pretty cool but but my job now is just to focus on every single day and just delivering the things that we need to deliver. Um, and you know, try and show our shareholders that, you know, there's there's a lot going on at the moment. Um, and then hopefully over the next couple of weeks, they can they can see some of these things come into action and and see that, you know, the the machine never stopped. It's just the machine, you know, had a brief period where it was recharging its battery so it could go even quicker.

**Anders:**
(0:40:35) Absolutely. Um I think the first time I interviewed you um last year we spoke about proof of reserves— SWC potentially doing that— and and you said that that's something you're evaluating. Is that something you— So we know MetaPlanet is doing it. Strategy will not do it. Orange is doing it in Brazil. Have you come to any conclusion of of um of if that's something you want to do or is the jury still out on that?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:41:02) Yeah, it's probably worth talking about the custody side of things alongside that. Um, so we believe that the right thing for us to do is to custody our Bitcoin— or how we custody it. Um, because self-custody for a Bitcoin treasury company is just not something that I want for our company. Um, the the risk to the the people that work at the company is is is just not acceptable. Um you know the the the you know it's it's it's it's just not acceptable. Um so the custody side of things you know we we put a lot of effort into having the right custodians with the right security in place so that there is is not points of weakness in the system which can be abused and um you know sort of jeopardize the safety of the people that work at the company. So that's that side of things. Um the second side of things directly in response to your question is is the proof of reserves. So I'm more in the Michael Saylor camp. We have looked at it a couple of times um because people ask us from time to time. Um you know at the end of the day, you know, we've got um— we're an audited company um that in the near future will be listed on the main market of the London Stock Exchange. Um there's pretty serious consequences if things aren't done properly. We use um you know the best custodians in the world. Um, I think if we ever do proof of reserves, I think it would probably be something that would be linked into um a service that's provided as part of the custody arrangements and we have spoken to them about that a little bit um to see whether or not we could go down that sort of route to get that solution. But, you know, I think at the end of the day, if you're going to buy our equity, you've got to trust the management knowing that there's pretty serious consequences if things aren't done in the right way. Um, so that's where we are at the moment. I'd never say never. And I think it's great that just like I said about other Bitcoin treasury companies doing different strategies, I think it's great that companies do things in different ways. And then it's down to the investors to think, okay, well, you know, what do we want from a company? And you know it may be in the future that some investors would say that you know we we wouldn't invest in Smarter Web because they don't do proof of reserves but I think we're a long way away from from that. I think I think the overall package of what we offer as an operating business with a Bitcoin treasury strategy is is is um quite a good um opportunity in my opinion for for most investors. And you know, maybe that is one thing that isn't perfect for some people, but um you know, it is what it is at the moment, but you know, like everything, we continuously look at everything.

**Anders:**
(0:43:52) Wonderful. Um makes sense. It's uh it's um pros and cons and and you got to do what's what's best for the the company and the shareholders. Um what else is um— have I not been asking you about? We we've spoken uh— no actually so so do have that question. Um I— you've always been limited because you're a publicly traded company in terms of talking about which tools um you're going to use or you're thinking about using in the future to create shareholder value through acquiring more Bitcoin per share. Is is there anything though you can say now in terms of um what technically could be possible or that you may not be doing but but— Is there anything you can say about potential tools that you haven't used yet for fundraising or or is it something we can only hear about once once you do them?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:44:45) Yeah. Yeah. I think we we've talked a lot about the options in in in the past and people have seen that, you know, we did the first Bitcoin denominated convertible bond in the UK called Smarter Convert. Um that's not been as popular as I hoped. And people can see that because we did that one tranche of it. We have got discussions with some other people and you may see some of those in the future. Um we've had a lot of stick the last few months because we're so keen on equity. Um you know equity is a fantastic tool for a company if sentiment allows you to to raise at a premium. Um I'm not very keen at all on debt. That's not to say that one day we might not have a little bit of debt because we might need to do something like, you know, like a share buyback, for example. And it might be that we we we we do that through debt, for example. But in in the foreseeable future, um things are going to continue as they are because in my opinion, um you know, we could probably get to three or four times the size of what we are using those strategies um very very well. We've done some analysis recently of the size of the UK equity markets um and they're vast. You know, they're vast in terms of a global um proportion. Uh clearly not as big as the states um but they are vast. Um you know, London is an excellent place in terms of the equity markets and we're still very very small. Um, so I think the the— you know in a good market you've got some some options and if you've got the ability to raise significant amounts of capital which we believe we do um you know it's the best all round. It's it's you know— personally I don't think Bitcoin is a risky asset. I think it's one of the least risky assets. There is a school of thought that thinks it's risky. So let's forget about our opinions about Bitcoin for the moment. But in terms of a capital raising strategy, if you're doing that based on um equity as opposed to um you know debt for example um you know and you can scale um with because you can raise equity then um yeah it doesn't really get much better than that in my opinion.

**Anders:**
(0:47:02) Yeah know that is a a phenomenal tool and has been and it was the main driver of yield. Let's not forget that last year for for treasury companies. Um, and on that note, uh, as I'm seeing on your website right now, uh, MNAV says 1.21. Uh, is is that the case or is— I'm I'm looking at USD, but I believe it should be calculated over— you had an open day in the market today, which we don't have in in US because of Martin Luther King Day, I believe it is. Um, but but is that is that correct now? That that's the MNAV ballpark you're at.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:47:35) Yeah. So the the share price on our website is the the share price as it's traded in the UK. Um so when people view the analytics in euros or pounds or or dollars, we just convert um the data. Um so the share price is accurate. It's the share price as of London closed, you know, two hours ago, whenever that was. Um you know, the US is closed as as you say. Um so yeah, it's accurate. 1.21.

**Anders:**
(0:48:02) Now, we like it.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:48:05) Historically, you know, like I I I personally, you know, think that at that price, it's an absolute bargain. If you look at our historic um you know, progress as a as a business. Um I think when it got to below a 1 MNAV, I found that very tough myself. Um and I thought the share price was a bit ludicrous. Um, it was almost priced that we were never going to do anything again, which, you know, anyone that's, you know, got to know me through these interviews or ever spoken to me knows that, you know, I will not rest. Um, so, you know, that was never going to happen. Um, so yeah, it's a start. You know, I'll be happier, you know, if or when it gets gets higher. And as I said earlier, um when you get to a a more reasonable MNAV, then you know the equity markets become absolutely awesome in terms of accretive capital raising.

**Anders:**
(0:49:00) And and it— I mean it doesn't even look like that's where we're going. It's literally where we're going with a positive movement lately. And um I think— I mean we are back at at least the beginning of the whole flywheel running again. It is like you raised money already last week and the the share price is even more um advantageous for doing that with a with a with a higher premium. Um, so it it it looks like we're back and um I think uh that is part of why the sentiment now— it's you know the worst is is behind us and and and the machine is running again and um with with the index buying uh from LSE listing coming up. Um it's— I think there's plenty of reasons to to be quite bullish on on seeing this whole thing running again and again. I'm I'm I'm happy that you have 2,664 Bitcoin and not half a million. Uh because it it will have a a probably relatively higher impact. Um and it's going to be amazing to see um Smarter Web Company um grow into this potential and start taking advantage of that uh on the London Stock Exchange. Very excited.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:50:08) Very excited. You you've got to remember as well, you know, like yes, we're the biggest Bitcoin treasury company in in in the UK, I believe. Um, but we're still tiny, you know, you know, there's so much that we can do to grow, you know, like there's there's people there that we need to overtake. Um, you know, sort of, you know, on the global scale. Um, you know, they're in the near-term sights. Um, but, you know, we're still tiny um in in in relative to where we want to be. Um, so yeah, you know, we're we're pretty pleased with how it's gone so far, but this is all about making this year count and and and I believe that we're, you know, at the start of that second wave and let's see whether it's as exciting as the first wave for our shareholders. Um I think that you know the the this year is going to be you know incredibly um you know good in terms of the company growing its balance sheet and you know doing a whole host of different things. So um you know there's never any guarantees but you know we're we're still very very small.

**Anders:**
(0:51:05) Absolutely. And it it's crazy to think that just about a month ago, you could be buying SWC shares for about 31% discount to the Bitcoin you're held— and um now the machine is running. Uh very very exciting. So we're almost up on the hour, but uh Andrew, it's always a pleasure to talk to you. Which questions haven't I asked you that— if there's something that you do want to share with everyone? Um I do want to uh give you an opportunity to touch upon something that I didn't ask you about um regarding SWC, the uplisting, the future, all of this.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:51:42) Yeah, I think you've um covered the main ones. You know, a lot of people are interested in the process um which I think we've covered quite well. Um a lot of people are interested in, you know, the capital strategies in the short term um and what they mean. You know, a lot of people are interested in when we're going to be buying Bitcoin again. Um, you know, and and all of those sorts of things. So, I'm hoping that most people found this chat, you know, um, relatively interesting. Um, and, um, I'm pretty confident that we've probably covered most the main things that that that people want to hear about, but, you know, um, you know, where are we now? So, Monday the 19th. So um you know let's do one of these again in the next couple of couple of weeks um and then maybe we can you know talk about some other things that have happened in the company perhaps.

**Anders:**
(0:52:32) That that sounds amazing. I do um— I will love to talk to you about the whole um the the actual main business. The last couple of months I've been helping a friend that uh that has a company that builds websites. Not at all at the scale that you did. And I I did have um uh couple of decades ago experiences working at commercial manager in a company which is more similar to what you're doing— one.com— which is you know standardized or module websites and I've got a lot of ideas from this last— in where I have stepped back into advisor only role um uh that uh that I think potentially could be um useful for SWC. Um what I'm seeing is you know apart from building website it is it could be a potentially quite profitable next step to offer some of the services around it like you know Google search ads, YouTube video advertising, social media advertising— and and because clients wanting a website often also wants it marketed and and if you do things right you can actually be uh— you can generate a lot of value there for clients and that when you can generate value that that comes back. So I I know you're— something is cooking there and excited to hear um because there's a big potential for for Smarter Web Company on the main business itself in my in my opinion.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:53:52) Yeah, for sure. So um you know as an operating business, you know, we're pretty excited about the future. We'll we'll we'll have to see whether that one sort of takes the shape that we believe it will. Um, but you're right, you know, the the core website business, you know, the the marketing extras that, you know, some people take, you know, the margins in those are pretty pretty healthy. Um, you know, and and the retention is quite good providing you're good at it. Um, you know, and and that's the holy grail really of this sort of, you know, business where you can sell a service that's sticky. Um, and it can be sticky, you know, through either technology or through results. You know, the service. Um, so yeah, we're we're we're pretty encouraged. You know, I think if you want it to be negative about it, um, you know, in the first nine months, then, you know, we've we've done our best to progress that. Um, but, you know, we could have done more, just like we could have done more with with everything, you know, um, you know, but, you know, we're, you know, we we believe we've got a, you know, a good plan for the future on that side of things. Um, and, you know, you know, I'm sure Alex is is busy working away now, but if he was watching, you know, like Alex has been key to all of that. Um, and, you know, I'm very very grateful for that, you know. Um, but yeah, I can't really talk too much about our specific plans on that because I'll get into a whole lot of trouble and we don't want that, Andrew. That's the last thing we need right now. We need the uplisting and we want the the index buying and all of that.

**Anders:**
(0:55:25) Um, very exciting. Well, um, Andrew, just thank you so much. Um, I want to say for for coming on here, uh, early after the announcement and and allowing, uh, me to to to to interview you and and and share all the good things coming at an early stage. Really appreciate that. It's always great to have you on. Um, and, um, excited to uh, do another one in a couple of weeks when you have more that you can share. I'm I'm definitely here for you. I'm— as you know— a shareholder and excited um for what the future— even the near future— uh looks like for SWC and very bullish for the year and the 10-year plan as well. Very bullish. What can I say? So thank you so much Andrew and again really appreciate the the merch here um that uh is is now my favorite uh Bitcoin t-shirt with the British flag and the B. Love it.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:56:15) Love it. And just to say that you can buy um not only the tickets for our conference on our website, but you can also buy the Smarter Web merch. We've got a small amount left. Um so, you know, um if you if you haven't got your Smarter Web merch, then you know, now's now is a good a time as any to get some.

**Anders:**
(0:56:35) Excellent. Well, thank you so much, Andrew. We'll uh we'll end it here. Thank you to everyone uh watching. It's um always great to have again this— I think amazing— Smarter Web community of investors uh on X and um and watching in and um having some fun in the chat as well. Um so thank you everyone for watching. Thank you again Andrew. Looking forward to do it in a couple of weeks again. Uh it looks like a very interesting um and bullish time to be following the company. So thank you Andrew.
