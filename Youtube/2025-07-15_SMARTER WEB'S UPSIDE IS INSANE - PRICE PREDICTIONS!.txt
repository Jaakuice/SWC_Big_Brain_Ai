## Key Topics:
- Smarter Web Company starting position: 1,275 BTC, 259.6 million shares, 491 sats per share at $122K BTC
- Core MNAV formula: S = B × P × M (share price = Bitcoin per share × BTC price × MNAV multiple)
- Equity raise mechanics: How dilution works when raising capital at premium multiples (5x NAV example: 21% dilution, 20% treasury growth)
- Three deterministic lanes to 10,000 BTC: 4x NAV (150 BTC/week, 14 months), 5x NAV (250 BTC/week, 8 months), 6x NAV (350 BTC/week, 6 months)
- Price predictions by lane: $11.20 (4x), $15.50 (5x), $20 (6x) assuming $122K BTC and maintaining multiples
- Monte Carlo simulation results: 3,000 universes show median 37 weeks to 10K BTC, 54% median dilution, $16.30 average final price
- Key insight: BTC per share rises despite dilution (target ~2,500 sats vs current 491), premium multiple is the throttle, dilution is a red herring
- Five nuclear truths: sats are destiny, premium equals throttle, dilution is red herring, Bitcoin price is wildfire, liquidity/regulatory risks are only mortal threats
- Current valuation analysis: Trading at ~6x MNAV, potential 5x increase in sats per share even with 60% dilution
- Risk factors: Order book liquidity and regulatory intervention are primary threats; MNAV compression could stall capital raising

**Adam Livingston:**
(0:00:00) Good morning, my dearest little whiz kids. My name is Adam Livingston and I am the Bitcoin Wizard, your number one source for Bitcoin and Bitcoin Treasury company analysis. Just a quick reminder, the Bitcoin Wizards tower is almost here. I'm putting the finishing touches on my private community Discord server this week. This is going to be the spot where I conduct all my analysis and hang out all day with you guys while I'm making content. So, if you become a YouTube channel member today, you will often get my videos a day early before they are posted, which during the greatest wealth transfer in human history is pretty cool. This also gets you access to the Bitcoin Wizards Tower at no additional cost. And if you purchase the level two membership, this will grant you access into the Bitcoin Wizards Council, which is a private group where I reveal my intentions, battle plans, and we actively cooperate to take over the world with the power of Bitcoin. For my followers on X, a subscription there gets you access to my subscription only posts as well as access to the Bitcoin Wizards Tower at no additional cost. Now remember folks, if you want the bleeding edge alpha every day with a bit of flare for fun, this needs to be a listenerup supported program. All of the bonuses are optional. I love you guys and your support. No pressure to do anything. That said, I really don't want to have to turn to reading ads or sponsorships or any of that kurfuffle that would impact the experience. Daddy needs to eat, okay? Daddy needs to pay for his family. Anyway, enough of that nonsense. Let's get to it because I am hyper bullish on Smarter Web Company like you wouldn't believe.

(0:02:00) Welcome to the seance where market caps whisper their deepest secrets. Tonight's victim Smarter Web Company begins with 1,275 BTC and a balance sheet hungrier than a tapeworm in a dollar menu. The mission crank that to 10,000 BTC before the fiat sun burns out, preferably inside a single human gestation period. Picture equity raises as introvenous orange juice at 5xnav. Every freshly printed share buys more Bitcoin than a Salvadorian street vendor on payday. Bitcoin per share rockets. Delilution politely asks permission and we end up valuing reality through a kaleidoscope of quantitative depravity. We're talking deterministic lanes, Monte Carlo peyote trips, and a neat little formula that turns premium capital into Satoshi steroids. Ignore it and the Fiat clown car keeps honking. Understand it and you see the same truth. Sailor chance before bed. Whoever hoards the most digital fire wins the war for time itself. Sprinkle salt on your CFA charter and let us witness how a micro cap morphs into a Bitcoin black hole. Price predictions on the way. Get excited.

(0:03:30) The XRay folks. Here's the X-ray before the steroids. Smarter web is sitting on 1,275 raw uncut BTC. enough digital plutonium to buy Twitter's collective attention for about 9 minutes. The cap table shows about 259.6 million shares, most of them held by day traders who still think that Sailor is a Marvel character. Do the simple division and we get 491 sats per share. Barely half a penny cheaper than the dignity of a venture capitalist pitching AI in 2025. Lock the spot price of BTC at 122,000. are mathematical sacrificial goat and you have the baseline nav we're about to pour rocket fuel on. Memorize these four numbers like they're nuclear launch codes because every model hallucination and Monte Carlo fever dream that follows spins out from this tiny innocent stack of 491 sats per ticket.

(0:04:30) Now watch what happens when we crank the money printer to ludicrous speed. Time to tattoo a single formula onto your frontal lobe. Thank you my dearest boy climb for ultra simplicity. Think of it as the Rosetta Stone for turning caffeine jitters into market clairvoyance. S is the share price, the number your Robin Hood app flashes while you're on the toilet. B is the Bitcoin per share, molecular orange energy trapped in equity form. P is the spot BTC price, the cosmic heart rate of the internet. Finally, M is the MNAV multiple, a legally sanctioned hallucinogen that lets investors pay5 pounds for one pound of balance sheet meat because capitalism. Watch the alchemy. If I goose M from 5 to 6, the chart jumps like a cat on a Roomba. Even if Bitcoin sleeps, if Bitcoin instead does a 3:00 a.m. moonshot, P lights the fuse and suddenly everyone pretends they always understood Austrian economics. And when B rises, that means the CFO just diluted the float, funneled the cash into fresh BTC, and cackled like a drunk wine mom who hedged the apocalypse. Burn this equation into your neurons because every crazy projection that follows is just remixing these four variables like a DJ trapped in a bull The Math market.

(0:06:00) Now, we crack open the spell book that lets a penny stock inhale Bitcoin like Tony Montana inhales powdered GDP. This is the incantation. Translation for the mortals. How many fresh shares must we unleash to grab an extra chunk of Bitcoin when our cultists are paying a multiple of the net asset value? S is today's float 259.6 million IUs fluttering in retail wallets. B is the current stash 1275 BTC glowing like radioactive tangerines. M is the premium we monetize the market into swallowing. And this is why the denominator matters, folks, because it's the moat between responsible dilution and a shareholder massacre. If CFO Bob tries to buy more BTC in a week than the multiple permits, the denominator approaches zero, S, spikes to infinity, and we accidentally reinvent hyperinflationary Germany. So Bob paces himself 250 BTC at a 5x nav, keeps the algebra polite. Live ammo example. Suppose we slap the table for 250 BTC at a 5x. Plug it in. Boom. Dilution up 21%. Treasury up 20%, BTC per share climbs like a squirrel on Red Bull. Every weekly raise we model later just loops this equation. Feeds the beast more sats and politely asks the market, "How much premium can you stomach today, champ?" Remember, our dearest cowboy captain Andrew Webbley isn't constrained by some mystical carrying capacity. Only by investor appetite and this naughty little fraction that keeps the balance sheet from imploding into a supernova.

(0:08:00) Determinism All right, captains. We're going to be doing deterministic modeling. Do you know what determinism is? Look it up, but be careful. If you end up at Schopenhower, you might end up killing yourself. What I mean is that I don't know what the market is going to price Smarter Web at a week from now. Nobody does. We need to think of MNAV as valuation. Now, I think I speak for all of us when I say that Smarter Web at a 5.7x MNAV with 28 days to cover means their stock is cheap. But you have a bunch of clowns not being able to wrap their head around that opportunity and they're running on X. That's where we all believe the opportunity is. Obviously, you're going to buy something from someone selling it. And you think you're getting the better end of the deal. We're in the introductory stage of this new valuation paradigm. So, I am being deterministic in assuming averages through the next 6 to9 months or so. Could the dilution from an average MNAV of four be reality? Yes. Could it be three? In my opinion, unlikely, but maybe. Because the multiple is valuation and valuation obviously dictates the stock price. We're going to go over three different deterministic paths.

(0:09:30) All right, class. Imagine Dr. Webbley and Professor Meyers standing over three giant levers labeled 4x, 5x, and 6x nav. Each one connected to a different size fire hose full of Bitcoin. I call these lanes. Number one, the conservative lane 4x snab 150 BTC per week. This is the diet coke of equity raises. We whisper sweet nothings to the market, collect a modest four times premium, and ladle out 150 coins per week. Enough to keep the treasury pulse alive without scaring the FCA. Great for when Reddit declares we're overvalued and the share price starts doing the Macarena. The base lane is a 5x nav, 250 BTC per week. Our Goldilock setting, not too hot, not too cold, just the fever dream. Smarter Web has already pulled off in real life at 5x nav were effectively selling paper promises at an 80% gross margin, funneling a quarter kiloton of digital gold onto the balance sheet every 7 days. Number three is the aggressive lane 6x nav 350 BTC per week. We price shares so dear you'd think they'd come with backstage passes to the rapture, then use that frothy capital to forklift 350 coins a week. Yes, delilution ticks upward, but BTC per share rockets because every pound raised buys proportionally more sats than it destroys with new shares. Side effects include nosebleleed valuations and analysts screaming bubble while secretly loading up. Why the lanes matter? They let us map bestase, median, and worstcase funding velocities without devolving into stochastic soup. Yet the premium is the X factor. It sets the cost of capital. The BTC per week slider sets the throttle. Blend them and you get tidy timelines. 25, 35, or 59 weeks to 10,000 BTC. So investors can decide which roller coaster car they're brave enough to board. Now, keep these lanes in your mental GPS. were about to floor the accelerator and watch those treasury Price Predictions numbers go up.

(0:12:00) Ladies, gentlemen, and lever pulling degenerates, behold the payoff grid. A spreadsheet so spicy it should come with a surgeon general warning. Now remember, the price assumes a 122k spot BTC and lane multiple holding till the confetti cannons fire. The 4x lane, that's Grandma's Volvo option. We mosy to 10k BTC in around 14 months. Printing shares like raffle tickets. Delilution swells to 69% but Treasury explodes 684%. So BTC per share still quadruples. Slow, yes. Fatal, no. Grandma gets there eventually with all her antiques intact. Check that out. A share price of 11.2 if it holds that multiple. That's what a 3x from today. You know, that's the thing. How many S&P returns is that compressed into 14 months? The fact that people think this is bearish is hilarious. The 5x lane is the sweet middle path. 8 months, 53% share dilution, and sats per share jumps 5x. Investors clap politely while their chart candles grow like little orange halos. This is the realistic scenario. If the market keeps treating us like a crypto costco, discounted sats in bulk, membership upgrade included. I give this a proper boom, not a doom. We're talking a $15.50 stock price by mid-March. And then here's the 6x lane. And remember, the stock is trading at around a 6x MNAV right now, maybe slightly under. So, do I think this is aggressive? Yes. I don't think the average dilution rate will probably be at a 6x nav. That said, we like the bull fuel, don't we folks? We like it. In 6 months, that would be a 43% share dilution and a share price that leaps to around $20. At this speed, the Treasury guzzles 350 BTC weekly, faster than Gary Gendler could have ever scheduled a press conference, and BTC per share punches through 2700 sats. Yes, Twitter will scream bubble, but remember, most bubbles are just early universes expanding. The big takeaway is the premium isn't just the garnish, it's the turbocharger. And the investor base needs to feed the beast to get there. Every notch higher on the X dial slices weeks off the timetable, trims delilution, and catapults intrinsic value. Meanwhile, BTC per share keeps rising in all lanes because we're funding with monopoly money priced above book. Translation: Dolphins win even when it's raining. Lock these milestones in your skull. Next slide.

(0:15:30) We toss the deterministic training wheels and let the Monte Carlos spray chaos like a confetti cannon full of orange pill The Monte Carlo Machine shards. Let's autopsy those end states and harvest the organs for wisdom. First revelation, the BTC per share rises in every lane. Second, timeline is a slave to premium velocity. Bump the multiple from 46 to 6x and we cut the journey from 59 weeks to 25. Third, dilution isn't the boogeyman Twitter spaces warned you about. Even at a 69% dilution, our sats per share quadruple. Imagine a vampire biting you. Every pint it drains is replaced by a transfusion of digital gold. Sure, you're woozy, but you can suddenly buy Manhattan. Fourth is price torque. The share rockets from 350 to nearly 20 in the aggressive lane without Bitcoin moving an inch. That's pure premium alchemy. My grandmother calls that making money out of thin air. Could you imagine if Bitcoin went up to 180,000 in the next six months? Yeah, we're talking some serious moola, folks. Economists call it multiple expansion. I call it how to pay rent in Bladeunner 2047. Finally, take this to heart. The only governor on this engine is investor appetite. If the market keeps swallowing shares at 6x like their Pringles, my dearest Professor Webbley will keep pressing by BTC until the balance sheet looks like it's swallowed by a minor sovereign reserve. That's deterministic reality and we haven't even unleashed the stochastic gremlins yet. Buckle up for the Monte Carlo chaos.

(0:18:00) Welcome to the Monte Carlo machine, where we hurl smarter web through 3,000 parallel universes and see which timelines end up with Lamborghini keys and which end up with a shareholder support group. Each universe ticks forward once per week. At every tick, Bitcoin price staggers around like a caffeinated drunk following a lognormal hopscotch with 8% weekly volatility, roughly 45% annual for the Bloomberg crowd who still believe in drifting averages. Spoiler. Drift is set to zero because the universe is cruel. Then a carnival barker spins the lane wheel of destiny. 30% chance we crawl into a 4x the NAV, 150 BTC per week, the broccoli lane. 50% chance we settle in a 5x nav, 250 BTC per week, the balanced diet. And a 20% chance we turbos snort the 6x 350 BTC per week, the cocaine buffet. Whatever lane pops, we smash that week's equity issuance. Price shares at the chosen premium and solve our dark algebra. Dilute accordingly, sweep the fresh cash straight into spot BTC, and then rinse, repeat like a financial groundhog day. No warrants, no debt, no late night regulatory love letters. Just raw dilution carnage and orange pill accumulation week after glorious week until the Treasury hits 10,000 BTC or we run out of electrons. Why Monte Carlo? Because deterministic lanes are bedtime stories. Monte Carlo is the UFC cage fight where fear, greed, and random number generators bash each other with chair legs. And when the dust clears, we'll have probability curves that tell us how often shareholders end up retired in Cabo versus selling their kidneys on eBay. Buckle up. Next, we show The The Stochastic Gospel Carnage.

(0:21:00) Behold the Carnage reports. 3,000 digital universes distilled into one smug little table and a histogram that will look like a python swallowed the Liberty Bell timeline roulette. The bell curve peaks at week 37. That's 8 months of caffeinated dilution. The P10 says 35 weeks, which is aggressive lanes dominating. P90 says 40 weeks. The broccoli lane overstays its welcome. Translation: Unless Jesse Meyer's laptop catches fire, you can pencil 10K BTC party hats by March 30th, 2026. The delilution reality check median shareholder swelling clocks at about 54% with a skinny 49 to 60% delilution spread. That's right. Even when our stochastic drunkard stumbles, he never dilutes you into oblivion because premium capital is still paying for the drinks. Share price fireworks, folks. Final ticket price averages $16.30 with most timelines squeezed between $1410 and $19.90. For context, today's share is about $4. So even the bearish 10th percentile path more than triples your monopoly money. SATs per share zen, the cosmic constant emerges 2,500 sats per share. In almost every universe, the variance thinner than a Calvin Klein model. Why? Because the Treasury growth nukes dilution noise. The equation doesn't care how messy the path is. It lands on the same orange square like Destiny with a calculator. This game rewards patience. You low IQ, high time preference, little bear posting goblin rat. The narrative punchline. Monty Carlo just confirmed what your guts been whispering. Smarter Web Share float may balloon like a dad bot in December, but BTC per share still stacks faster than a cocaine DJ at closing time. Worst realistic case, you're diluted 60% yet your sats quintuple and your equity 4 to 6x's. Best case, Twitter spaces combust from jealousy and you retire on a yacht named Nav Premium. That's the stochastic gospel.

(0:24:00) Now, let's map the risk landmines before we high-five each other into compliance jail. Feast your retinas The Bell Curve on this Technicolor Confession of probability. A bell curve of weeks to 10,000 BTC that looks like a boa constrictor digesting a pocket watch. A dilution density that resembles a politely compressed accordion instead of a torso explosion. See that majestic hump peaking at 37 weeks? That's the universe whispering, "Relax, kid. You'll be orange jacket rich before your next dentist appointment. The tails are so skinny you could thread them through the eye of a regulatory needle. Meaning black swan delays require either a BTC flash crash or the FCA staging a surprise intervention with pitchforks in holy water. Imprint these shapes on your hippo campus. This screams one thesis. Smarter Web's delusion is noisy. Timelines vary, but SATS per share is the immovable object in this otherwise drunken dance of capital mischief. The Bitcoin wizard is your guiding light to Valhalla. Don't you forget it.

(0:25:30) Here's the grand moral of tonight's financial fever dream. Distilled into five nuclear truths. Number one, sats are destiny. No matter how many dilution donuts we eat, treasury torque overwhelms share inflation, delivering a near certainty of 2500 sats per share, a five bagger in orange atoms versus today's 491 sat crumbs. That's gravity with a laser pointer. Number two, premium equals throttle. Keep the market paying 6x nav and the 10k BTC trophy arrives in 6 months. Fun fact, every bare post you scream kills settlement. Shut up, idiot, and play the waiting game. Let the premium sag to 4x and the champagne chills for 14 months. Same finish line, different Spotify playlists. Number three, delution is a red herring. Even the worst plausible path tops out at a 60% share creep, while BTC per share quadruples. It's like gaining 5 lbs of muscle for every one pound of fat. Ugly on the scale, gorgeous in the mirror. Number four, Bitcoin price is wildfire. A moonshot slices the timelines in half. A crash doubles the equity needed. Either way, SATs per share still grows just at the pace of a cheetah versus a caffeinated tortoise. Hedge accordingly or embrace chaos. Dealer's choice. Number five, liquidity and regulatory risk are the only mortal weapons. If order books dry up or regulators gate crash the party, placement cadence stalls and the model sputters. Monitor MNAV like a cardiac rhythm and keep a plan B funding football. Bonds, warrants, or an offshore SPV named after an obscure Greek deity. A smarter web isn't playing stock market. It's weaponizing premium capital to horrid digital scarcity. Hold shares and you ride the orange tsunami. Stand aside and you'll be Instagramming regret memes from the sidelines. Go forth and frontr run the future. That's not a command. It's performance art.

(0:28:00) Calm down. This isn't financial advice. This is financial entertainment. Don't listen to me. I'm just some 29-year-old millionaire Bitcoin wizard. Go to Dave Ramsey with this info and let him tell you what he thinks before you do anything stupid. I'm not a financial adviser, so everything you do is at your own peril. I just like doing math. My name is Adam Livingston, and I hope you found this information helpful or entertaining. Like this video and subscribe to the channel for the bleeding edge alpha during the greatest wealth transfer in human history. Have a terrific day, my dearest little goblin captains. Class dismissed.
