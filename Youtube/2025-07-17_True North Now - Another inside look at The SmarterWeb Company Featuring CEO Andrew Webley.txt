**Host:**
(0:00:00) Good morning everyone. This is True North now episode 6. Uh we are joined uh with Andrew Wley, the CEO of the Smarter Web Company. Second time he's been on. Last time we had a fantastic conversation. This time I think we're going to have an equally great conversation. So Andrew, Bitcoin just hit 123,000. Things are very very hot in the market. Um we are seeing a bit of a you know retrace today. No big deal. We're still sitting around 116 117. So with that little um leadin, tell me where do you think Smarter Web is right now? How are you feeling about the markets? How are you feeling about um your strategy, the execution, everything? Just give us a good rundown.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:00:45) Yeah, please say we're doing okay. I would agree. Yeah. Yeah. We we announced um last Friday, I think it was that we've got um to 1275 Bitcoin held. So that's that's quite pleasing. I think that everyone knows using the publicly available information that we can get significantly above 1,500 with the Bitcoin that we've got. Um you know, when you combine it with the cash, um you know, reasonable amount above that. Um so I'm pleased with that. Um, I was looking earlier today at um, you know, some of the leak tables. Um, you know, bitcoin treasuries.net is one that I use a lot. Um, and I think based on our current, um, treasury, I think that would probably put us in the top 25 of global companies. So, I think that's a good start. You know, we've got to remember that we're only just over two months into life as a public company. Um, yes, I'm pleased with that. I think our strategy is working well with our approach to how we raise capital and how we take the capital as pounds and then deploy it into Bitcoin. I think that's working very well at the moment and I think that over time everyone can can see that into the future but also if they look back at the last couple of months. So yeah, it's it's it's pretty good so far. Um there's lots of things that are going on behind the scenes as well that you know I can't talk about at the moment which I'm I'm pleased about as well. So you know my job as the CEO is to focus on you know not so much the dayto-day movement of things but very much onto if we're heading in the right direction and you know I believe that we are at the moment.

**Host:**
(0:02:15) Yeah I I would agree. I've been following you fairly closely. I think you do have a good plan. And I think you do have a good execution strategy. And along those lines um something uh recently has come up you know in conversations on X about um your you know your cash your cash position your execution timing um things of that nature. Some feel that having cash on a balance sheet is is a wrong view or a wrong execution strategy of the sailor strategy altogether. Others believe that having a balanced approach where you do maintain some somewhat of a cash resition u makes sense as well. Uh so give give some insight. What are some of your thoughts on that? I know that you know X can be a very very loud place when it comes to commentary but um I do I did see that you did interact with some of those comments. So would you share some of your thoughts on that topic?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:03:00) Yeah, sure. So when we first IPOed um some some you know great people um they they critiqued the strategy ever so slightly um and then as as time went on everyone saw that um the strategy worked as we've done it. Um I think it's important to say that where we've been for the first two months is different to where we'll be in the second two months. Um, so the strategy changes over time as with any good business. You you evolve, you adapt. Um, but our strategy, if you look back at my early interviews, you'll see that there's a um there's still a delay um small delay in deploying cash into Bitcoin. um you know we are an operating business so we're not so reliant on capital raising to generate the capital to survive which is really important in the not just the regulatory position in the UK but also in terms of having a a long-term successful business that has adopted a Bitcoin treasury strategy. Um, so, so yeah, I think the the like obviously I I I know exactly where we are at the moment and there's certain information that's that's that's been updated and we update the market as quickly as we can on on on things. Um, but I think we're in an excellent position and I'm I'm I'm very much looking forward to the, you know, the the coming weeks and months.

**Host:**
(0:04:15) Good. that I think that um you know it's very easy for people in the community to get caught up in narratives and I want to I just like to remind everyone that Bitcoin the Bitcoin treasury companies these aren't adversarial plays these are cooperative plays. So I think that um execution there there's a lot of things that go into it as operating company. So I I want to urge people to not get too bogged down in narratives perhaps. Um and along those lines, one of the things you have said consistently is you want to be the largest company in the UK, right? Um just on a factor of Bitcoin's potential price trajectory and a continuous acquisition strategy, I think that there's something that you can actually achieve, especially in the UK. Um, not to put you on the spot, but if you do see a future where you are the largest company in the UK and since that is the goal, how long do you think it's going to take to get there? And is that a position that you think that you can hold? And I want to be very very specific here by by holding, right? When you get to that point, I know you have three levers to your business. You have the operating business, you have the Bitcoin acquisition strategy, and you have potential acquisition strategy. So where do you see those three rungs going if you do become the largest company in the UK?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:05:30) Yeah. So I think about a company like ours um in terms of what we've got to do today and in the coming months but then I also think about much longer term um and I think it's quite simple. If you're an incredibly well capitalized business with an incredibly strong balance sheet um I think you by default you become the equivalent of a bank of the future. Um so with with that you've got tremendous options that you can do. Um you know if it's probably if you look at something like maybe Korea um you know I think probably the 80s maybe that was the the pivotal moment there when you had these massive um trading companies um that did everything under the sun. Um so maybe it evolves to something like that. Um you know banking is not a very profitable thing in itself. Um so you know when I say a bank of the future I just mean more like a a capital um you know a company with a very very strong capital position. Um I was in New York um recently um when we just before we did the IPO um and I was walking around. I went up the Rockefeller Center looking at this the model at the bottom of the Rockefeller Center and you know it struck out to me that um you know maybe this is the the the best moment for a hundred years you know approximately 100 years when that was built. Um, you know, if you look at those some of those big buildings in New York, you know, they they grew up from people and families and businesses that were incredibly well capitalized. Um, because they were in in a unique point in time. Um, and so, so that's kind of how I see this. Um, so obviously the web design side of things is very very important. The acquisition strategy is important and building a business that's got a balance sheet that's built on the best asset in the world is is incredibly important, too. So, um I think we just retain our nimleness. Um I've obviously done the maths in my head of what it means based on where we are today and and and the multiple of where we'd need to be. It's approximately 150 by the way. Um to be, you know, the biggest company in the UK. Um we've all got our own opinions, you know, in sort of say a year, two years, five years, 10 years what Bitcoin will do. Um that's an element to it. also the the capital raising strategies. That's an element to it. Um, everyone laughed at me at the start when I said that I want my business to be in the Footsie 100. Um, and they're not laughing now. Um, and um, and and you know, yeah, I I I believe that you should try and be the best and you know, our business is is a UK business, you know, um, listed in the UK and you know, why not try and be the biggest and the best company in the UK?

**Host:**
(0:08:15) Yeah, exactly. Why not? So, I'm piggybacking off of that, you are a UK company. You do have the regional exposure to the to the UK. You are serving as a Bitcoin exposure vehicle for a lot of the a lot of the investors in the UK right now. And we talked about this in the previous live stream that there's not easy ways to get Bitcoin exposure in the UK. So, with that said, I know that um you know, for instance, with strategy and the preferred offerings, uh those are things that have gotten a lot of interest in the market, right? in terms of both investor sentiment and market perception with regards to um what they can be used for, how they can be scaled, the different levers that allow strategy to have. So in that future where smarter web is one of or if not the largest company in the UK, do you see other offerings along those lines um existing in smarter web as part of the smarter web I guess you can say um smarter web economy? I like to talk about strategies and economy. So in a way you would be acting as an economy a bitcoin economy in the UK if you do scale to that size and if you do have potential preferred offerings or other offerings along along those lines. I know you can't give specifics but are those things that you are looking at that you are interested in that you think that could be interesting.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:09:30) Yeah for sure. Um you know obviously time flies at the moment but I met Michael Sailor in London maybe two weeks ago. Um, and we were talking about that. We're talking about what he would do, what he wouldn't do if he was doing things again. And I think the holy grail in in the Bitcoin Treasury company is to have those additional lines of equity, bonds that are wrapped as equity. Um, you know, because effectively they're a convertible debt product which you're in control of. Um, and you know, I think that is very much the way that we'll go. you know, I I can't say too much about it, but we've had initial discussions around how they get structured, the process, where they get listed, um, all these sorts of things. And and and I think it's just a case of we need to get to a certain size, not that much bigger than we are at the moment, but but bigger than we are at the moment. Um, until you can do those things. Um, so yeah, I don't think it'll be long, um, relatively speaking until you see, you know, um, you know, smarter, preferred products. Um, I think the great thing about when you do those is that you're in control of it. Um, so if you look at what Sailor's done with strategy, um, you know, it's great because those products can complement each other. So you can give different pools of capital access to products that are beneficial to them, but then you can use those those products, you know, alongside each other um to manage your well effectively to manage your MNAV um to to build the business over the longer term. Now, I think as you get bigger, um, it's good because it allows you to smooth out a bit of the volatility as well because, you know, take a business our size, volatility is incredibly important. Um, you know, it's better obviously on a good day. Um, you know, no one really likes it on a bad day, but, you know, if you take this week for example, you know, Monday a down day, Tuesday so far a down day. If Wednesday is an upday, if then you know our you know our our ATM staff facility will kick in. Um so as as you're a bit smaller and you're getting bigger, you you have different tools available to you. But when you get to a certain size, yeah, you you can use some of those other tools and and and they're really exciting. I think you probably need to get to, you know, a treasury of say 400 500 million before it's worth doing that because there is a cost to doing that as well. Um the great thing that we've got thanks to Michael Sailor um is that there's someone out there educating the world, you know, the people that buy these products, you know, um that, you know, these things do exist. Um, and so, you know, just like he's done for lots of the other things that businesses like us are are are doing, you know, that walk is that little bit easier. Um, you know, and I'm truly grateful for all of that as well.

**Host:**
(0:12:30) That's great context. Thank you. And, um, you those are some of the similar thoughts I had. I I didn't want to press you too much on anything you can potentially talk about, but I'm glad that you gave that insight. And just keeping on this topic really quickly here, if and if you can't say too much on this, that's totally fine. And I was just curious, would there be any sort of regulatory issues or roadblocks to having your own version of the preferreds in the UK market because I'm not very familiar if there would be, but I I know that that is a question that would likely come up. So, I'm just curious.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:13:00) No. So, when we were talking, um I said to him, you know, would you not be a bit annoyed because he said to me, just call it, you know, like smarter stride, smarter strife, and you know, so on and so forth. And I saw that post. I saw a post that said that. Yep. Yep. And I said, "Would you not be a bit annoyed if if I just, you know, ripped off, you know, your names and put smarter in front of it?" And he said, "No, that's absolutely fine." And from a regulatory point of view, um, you know, we can do that. You know, of course we can do that. It's it's just another another product that you can if you you know what I've said since the start is that in most of the countries you know the ones that I'm most familiar with are the UK and the US of course you've got the same toolbox. It's just how you use that toolbox. So if you look at us you know we're one of the only maybe even at the moment the only company in the UK um that's got an ATM style facility. Um so just because you don't just because something isn't done normally in a market um or something hasn't worked in the past you know it doesn't mean to say that if it's not done right and if it's implemented it well um that you can do that so you know generally speaking you can do the same stuff in in the UK that you can do in the US including the pref shares um so sometimes you have to call them different things um but no there's there's no sort of regulatory um challenge Um the the only challenge is like I say it's it's you do the right things at the right time when you're the right size. Um but that's the same as the other bits in the journey as well in my opinion.

**Host:**
(0:14:30) And along those lines of being able to do the same things just in different ways or having to call them different things. Um the ATM facility that you've created makes you a bit of a trends setter in the UK, does it not? And I think that um the other UK companies that would like to ATM-Style Innovation: Creating UK-first facilities and setting trends impart on the Bitcoin journey or including the ones that already exist, I would imagine that they would probably follow a similar model. And the reason why I bring that up is do you see yourself as a deliberate trend setter or perhaps someone that's setting a trend just by virtue of being on the Bitcoin um treasury journey or do you see this as just a natural progression of trying to you know do what's being done in the US following the strategy model in the UK and you're just trying to find ways in which to do that.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:15:15) A bit of both really. Um, so what I'm hopeful of, um, is that, you know, you you've got lots of other good players in our space that, you know, are all doing good things. Um, you know, and and then, you know, maybe even someone can do something that we can, you know, sort of, you know, um, take inspiration from. Um, so far all of that inspiration has come from people in in other countries. Um, but you know, I'm I'm hoping that when we get more companies that are doing um this well, um, then there'll be some of that. Um, I think the problem that the the UK market's got with, um, people trying to do a facility, an ATM style facility like us, is it won't work unless you've got liquidity. Um, so I was looking at a report last night and you know we do 10 times the volume of of the next best um, which is, you know, this is on a sample of yesterday by the way. Um, and and that's that's considerably better than the majority of the others. So if you haven't got liquidity, those sorts of tools aren't really suitable for you. you're better off to put the work in, you know, to build a business in the right way with the right capital structure and and do those things at the right time. Um, so for me, it's quite simple to do things, you know, as as we've done them, which is I what I believe at the right the right things in the right way at the right times. But, um, I don't think you can just have one. It has to, you know, work to the benefit of it. um you know because otherwise you'll have an ATM and it will produce nothing um you know so um so yeah but you know like you know anyone is welcome to to do that and you know they're they're also welcome to say thank you if they want um yeah they probably should they probably should quite frankly but

**Host:**
(0:17:00) um keeping along that that um point you mentioned something that's very very important with regards to the ATM you said that you need the volume to be able to support which is perfectly true, but you also need sentiment, right? And one of the things I've said that some people strongly disagree with is that MNAV is a function of sentiment. And the reason why I bring that up is you are very very engaged with the smarter web investor community on X. Um, you know, you have the meme running of, you know, we think we're doing okay and everyone has picked up on it and or or that you're doing somewhat good and that has picked up on it as well. So you clearly, I think, understand the value of community engagement, investor sentiment, um, and how that can affect the broader perception of the equity. Is that something that comes to you naturally? Because I'm inclined to say yes, just based on your history. Um, for instance, in your previous role, you had the um, top of the stocks um, you know, charts, and I thought that was a very, very clever um, pun on top of the pops. And people in the US probably have no idea what I'm referring to right now, but um it seems that you naturally lean into the meme as I call it, right? You embrace the memeability of the Bitcoin space and that seems to be something that comes naturally to you. So do you think that as the front person of this journey that investor engagement is something that you must do and you must actively participate in or do you think that it's something that you can eventually pull pull back from and allow the um opportunity to take take its own life and see where it goes? And I asked that specifically because if you take a look at um GME for instance, they're taking an entirely different approach of they're being very very hands-off. They're not engaging with the community. They're not, you know, leaning into the memeability and leaning into the importance of sentiment in the community and they have an entirely different model to follow. And I think it's a very very interesting just position. So what are your thoughts on it?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:19:00) Yeah. So the the the most important thing here to say is that you know I set up the Smarter Web Company. Um before it became a public company it was 100% my business um and my wife's obviously um because we were 50/50 shareholders. Um and I really care about it. Um the other reason um which is quite important is I listed my business on the stock market in the UK because I wanted a business that I could invest in myself. Um and that's that's really important. So I'm not an opportunistic person that thinks that this is a way of making a couple of million quid or something. Um you know this this is something that I care about. you know, I care about more this more about the success of the business than I do about my own personal financial position. Um, and I think because the UK's had such a torid time for 10 or 15 years or however long it's been with the equity markets on the whole, there's been the odd blip, positive blip. Um, I think that's why investors probably like it. So, this isn't, you know, this isn't a promote, this isn't an opportunistic thing. this is something that I believe in that I wanted for myself and you know that's that's how we're doing it and then you know if I look at my past you know I've had some I've had some great times um in investing you know some really successful ones and I've also had some particularly one terrible terrible investment um so I know what it what it's like to lose as well as to win through investing and that's why for the last few years when I've been planning exactly how I could do this and and how I believe I can do it successfully. Um, you know, I've learned from all of the the bad stuff as well as the good stuff. And and and and I think people probably like that. Um, you know, if I was looking to invest in in a Bitcoin treasury company in the UK, um, because I only hold one, which is our company, of course, I hold others globally. Um, then that's what I would look for. um you know I suppose if if we were chefs it would be you know if you can't eat your own cooking you know um you know that sort of a thing but you know that's what I believe in you know I've you knowve I've done everything in my career on that basis um you know and and I you know I think it's the right way of doing things and you know that's that's how I've done it and you know it seems to have worked okay so far um you know you know I've I've even bought shares on the market recently. You know, I didn't have to do that. I could have bought them, you know, before or not bought more. You know, it doesn't make any difference to my holding and it was a significant amount of money to me. Um, you know, I believe in this. I believe in it more than I believe in in anything else. You know, I've obviously got the luxury of of um, you know, obviously knowing um, you know, exactly what we're doing, which means that also I can't buy shares at certain times. Um, but yeah, I it's just how I think it should be done at the end of the day. and and and whilst we're taking inspiration from some of the things that people have done elsewhere, I'm I've tried to do it all as I think it should be done. Um and with that, I'm sure there'll be the odd mistake further down the line, you know. Um you know, hopefully not too many mistakes and and and if there are mistakes, we'll be honest with people and we'll we'll we'll do our best to sort of, you know, address them. Um you know, because we're not perfect, you know. Um, so, so yeah, that that's where it comes from. It's it's no more than that. It's it's, you know, at the end of the day, when people buy shares your company, they want you to do the best job that you can. And if you can't do that for them and to put in the time every single day and to communicate with them and things, perhaps, you know, you shouldn't be doing it. Um, that's what I think anyway.

**Host:**
(0:22:30) I would agree. And along those lines, you know, there there's some and I'm I want to be very specific with what I'm saying here that I'm not comparing you to strategy. I'm just drawing a parallel. There is a common parallel with with the fact that Sailor is so invested in this plan because strategy is a company he started. He is very very in he is very very invested in it. Um both personally and professionally. He has you know seen as you mentioned a nasty drop. We all know what people criticize him for with the do bubble and so on and so forth. and you started Smarter Web and you um are very very invested in the in the in the current plan both um personally and professionally and it does give you a level of authenticity based on the feedback I've gotten from the the broader community that you are personally invested in this and I bring it up to to say this you've mentioned in other interviews and recently here that there are some players in a market that may be not invested not believers but opportunistic that they see an opportunity here to, you know, make some money to raise their stock price, kind of riding the wave of Bitcoin and and being opportunistic in that sense. And so that leads me to a question here. Do you think that because of that potential opportunistic nature of some of the other players in the market and the inevitable negative sentiment that will come because of that because I think that opportunistic players are more likely to be shaken out. Do you think that it is something that can negatively impact smarter web? How do you see yourself navigating that? Do you see yourself staying the course and just being a player that's keeping the the path and staying forthright and staying forward? Or do you see yourself as having to perhaps counterbalance that in terms of how you communicate with the market and how you address the market just because the market may get, for lack of a better term, spooked if players start dropping out and if opportunistic players start being exposed.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:24:30) I think the only thing that we can do is we can control what we do. Um so, you know, we've got something that will um will publish in the near future, which is um you know, a really good way that we can try and show the wider community and also the people that aren't so experienced in the Bitcoin community how they can understand the value of a company that holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet. So, we're trying to do things like that. you know, we've done a lot of work on the regulation side of things to try and make that better, but at the end of the day, we can't control, you know, things that other companies may may do. Um, you know, I can emphasize um, you know, if people lose money through these things, you know, it's but I can't control that. All I can do is try and do my job to the best possible way. And this is very much a long-term mission. So, you know, if there's a few bumps in the road that aren't caused by us, then I think we just have to carry on. You know, I love it when the share price goes up. I don't like it so much when it goes down, but it's part and parcel of it. You know, it's not, you know, it's a bit um it's a bit bumpy, you know, but, you know, personally, like when I'm investing in things, I like volatile things. Um, you know, it's how you get performance. Um, so you know, I think we just have to hope that no one does anything too bad. Um, you know, and and that's not so much because of how it would hurt us, but it's because of how it was would hurt people that get caught up investing in it. Um, but hopefully that won't be h won't happen, you know, um or or certainly not on any particular size. Um, and um I think that's all we can do. You know, I I got some advice from somebody who's been very successful in this space when I was in Vegas recently, and he said, "You can't worry about what other people do. You know, just focus on what you're doing. Stick to your plan." Um, and and and that's what we try and do. But, you know, obviously we're only human beings. Um, so you do look at what other people are doing and you think, you know, why are you doing that? You know, you don't have to do it like that. You know, like you could do it better, you know. Um, but you know, that's just the nature of the beast at the end of the day and you know, you just just, you know, stick stick to the plan.

**Host:**
(0:27:00) I would agree. So, last question I have for you, more of a fun question that you may or may not be able to answer. Bitcoin just hit 123,000 the other day. You know, the sentiment was very high. The everyone was talking. I was talking about it. Um, it was it was a great moment and it I think it caught a lot of people in the market off guard because there were so many different news posts about Bitcoin is going to 123,000. What does this mean? What does this say about Bitcoin? What does this say about the market? So, two-part question. What do you think it means, if anything, that Bitcoin hit 123,000 recently? Is it just a natural progression of number go up or do you think that it it's a representative of a broader shift in sentiment and perception about Bitcoin as an asset? And two, price prediction. Where do you think that we're going to be at the end of the year?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:27:45) Yeah. So, I hate that second question, but I will try and answer it. So, I was I was I was traveling when when Bitcoin got to that um that that level um and I was chuckling to myself when I was looking at it on my phone um when it got to 121. Um because, you know, obviously everyone likes the 21 number for for lots of reasons. And I thought, how funny would that be if it stayed there but smashed through it? Um, obviously it's come off a little bit since, but um, and then I've been saying to, you know, some of our advisers for a couple of weeks now, I've been saying, you know, obviously it's not impossible to buy Bitcoin because it's incredibly liquid and you can almost always buy it. But from some of the exchanges that we buy it from because we buy it in a variety of different ways, um I have noticed that it's it's been, you know, relatively speaking quite hard work to get Bitcoin at a good price, you know, at some of those moments, which is quite unusual actually, certainly in my experience anyway. But but my experience is different because we've been buying bigger and bigger amounts and but I'm fairly confident um that what I've seen from the market over the last couple of weeks is you know sort of suggesting of what would happen now. So you know yeah that's that's my take on that. And then in the second part of the question, uh the price the price level. Well, I think being selfish about it, talking about it purely from our company's point of view, um I'm very glad that we've got the treasury that we've got at this point. Um you know, I I think we've managed to acquire a reasonable amount of Bitcoin um in a you know, a fairly short time period, which gives us a really good base to build on for the future. So the key with a Bitcoin treasury company in my opinion is that the stronger Bitcoin is, the easier it is to raise capital and then you know to keep that firewall going. Um so of course the flip side of that is that the stronger Bitcoin is, the more expensive it is to buy. So going back to our long-term approach and the fact that the longerterm investors should in theory do the best, you know, that hold it for the longest amount of time, you know, um you know, because that's the very nature of the compound model here. Um you know, I think we're in a really good position. You know, if Bitcoin rips, great. If it hovers here, fine. Um and we'll just see just see how it goes really. Um, I don't like talking about a price level. Um, I think one bit. Come on, just throw a number out there. I I think your safest bet if you want to sit on the fence is just to go to 30% above where it was at the start of every single year. You know, that's that's that's a pretty likely bet. Um, the Makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. We're not there yet. I I put it this way. um I wouldn't be surprised to see it the other side of 150. I've heard some significantly higher levels um talked about, you know, and then again, you know, we've been hearing that for years as well. Um I'm I genuinely believe we're going into the millions, you know, probably multi-millions um in the not tooistant future. Um you know, I'm 47, so let's say that's before I'm 55, 60, something like that. Um, which is, you know, that's considerable. Um, so yeah, I'm as long as as long as things keep getting better all the time for everything as a whole, then, you know, I you know, I can live without it ripping massively. But I do like watching it. You know, it's great. Um, this weekend when when um when it when it started to go, it was it was pretty cool. Um, pretty cool to see that because the one criticism that some people have had is, you know, why is it not doing a great deal? Me and my friends, we joke that, you know, we used to think Bitcoin was, Bitcoin Price Views: Near-term predictions and liquidity-linked potential you know, really the most exciting asset in terms of watching the price. Um, whereas now obviously it's all about Bitcoin treasury companies. And you know, I joked to someone earlier today that you know, sort of when in the UK when we get the ETNs, which will hopefully be later this year, then you know, I'll probably get an allocation to that myself for the cautious part of my portfolio. Um, so um, you know, we'll see, but I I'll be massively surprised if Bitcoin isn't higher than where it is today. And it's, as we're talking now, it's probably like what is it 11718? Something like that. Something like that. Yeah. So, I'll be massively surprised if by the end of the year it's not, you know, considerably higher.

**Host:**
(0:32:00) Yeah, I'm actually aligned with you. I think that um we're likely to see the other side of 150. The the predictions of three to four to 500,000 I think would be a little bit outlandish unless we have a change in um liquidity and we have broader market stimulus in the form of money printing. But I I'm I'm aligned with you. I think that that's a fairly um reasonable bet to make. And I was having fun with it this weekend as well. I was retweeting every time. It went to 119, then 120, 121, then 122 to 123. I was retweeting the whole time. So, I was I was enjoying it myself. But Andrew, any closing thoughts um for the community? Uh we had another great conversation. I know that they love hearing from you. So, feel free to share any closing thoughts you have.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:32:45) Yeah, I just want to say thanks to everyone for all the support. You know, like um you know, we couldn't do this without the community. you know, our our community on X has got I think it's got three and a half thousand people in it now. Um yeah, I started at 100. So that's incredible. Yeah, it's incredible. Um you know, it's it's it's amazing to see. You know, I've been really busy this week so far, so I've not kept an eye on it quite as closely as I do. Um I try and check it, you know, sort of once, twice, three times a day, just see what everyone's saying. You know, I'm learning from what people say as well. So, you know, if people are posting things, you know, like the chances are I will see it at some point. Um, I won't always agree with everything, but you know, I welcome all input from everyone. Um, so yeah, I just just want to say thank you to everyone and, you know, we'll we'll keep doing our best and, you know, we believe that we've got the right strategy for the moment. Um, and um, you know, um, we we just keep keep keep doing our best.

**Host:**
