**Jesse Myers:**
(0:00:00) All right. Hello everyone to the first Smarter Web livestream. We've done a number of uh Twitter spaces before and figured we might as well do this as a as a livestream and uh have the sort of podcast format. So, it's been a while, Andrew, since we've we've done a session, the two of us. Uh and there's been a lot that has happened in in the last month or so. So, you know, I made note of— let's see. So, let's go through kind of what has happened and then we can talk about all the um the the developments that that have occurred in the last month. So, um a couple weeks ago, we announced our intention to uplist to the London Stock Exchange going from the Aquis market to LSE main market. Uh then a little after that we released the official prospectus detailing that move and and and the company's um full details. Uh very recently we bought 10 Bitcoin. So we have um resumed Bitcoin buying after a couple months of very tough conditions in the market. Uh and and then I also think another notable thing that has happened over the last month is uh Michael Saylor saying quite directly on a on a podcast that um that they have no intention of of launching products in the UK, but that it's a great opportunity for whichever uh Bitcoin treasury company is in position to do that. Um, so in my mind, that's probably the most eventful um month that that Smarter Web has had since maybe last summer. Uh, and and I I think we we'll start by talking about each of those items. But yeah, any any thoughts? Anything else that I missed that that you think is also been going on or any thoughts there?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:01:25) I think you covered most the main ones. There are other things as well, but they're certainly the main ones, and if we get time, we can touch on some of the other things. Um, I think for for me and you and the whole whole team, it's been really nice that we can actually talk about some things. Um, because, you know, we started the uplisting project many many months ago. Um so much work's gone into it um because it it's it's a very involved process and there isn't certainty um until— well until the day that you uplist actually— but you know we're we're we're very close to almost certainty. Um, and you know, it's really hard for everyone when when you you you can't say certain things, you know, because as everyone knows, we believe in transparency and keeping our shareholders informed, but you know, we're not allowed to say certain things until we're allowed to say them. Um, so yeah, I feel like— don't know about you, Jesse— but for me, I feel like a a weight's been lifted off my shoulders with that one that I'm actually allowed to talk about it. And, you know, everyone was expecting it. Um but at least now they know um you know what's officially being released by the company.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:02:35) Yeah, I think for for quite a while there especially towards the end it was uh difficult for you to have field all these questions about about you know when is it— when is that happening— and and little did they— did did folks know that you had been up to your eyeballs in it for months and we were very close to being able to talk about it but but uh weren't able to until until now.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:02:58) The thing that's been great as well is um— well two things really, two different sides of it— is a) it's been nice seeing the sentiment and the support come back into our stock. You know obviously when you're a Bitcoin treasury company there's going to be good times and bad times. The volatility is what makes the model possible to a degree. Um so that's been nice seeing the sentiment and the support come back in. Um, you know, it's tough for the shareholders when you're trading below a 1 MNAV, but it's also tough for the company that's, you know, slogging their guts out every single day. Um, but then the other thing that's that's really cool and and above my expectations to be fair at this this point in the game um is to see the number of of calls and meeting requests that we're getting um from both the UK and internationally. Everyone seems to be really supportive about what we're doing, genuinely excited about it. Um and you know there's obviously benefits that come from that as we progress from here um for the next couple of weeks and months.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:04:00) Yeah, I think that's that's right. It has been a— from our perspective just kind of to share with with folks out there um— for quite some time, we've had the the hypothesis that uh Bitcoin treasury companies will be subject to market conditions and sentiment will shift between enthusiasm for Bitcoin and and greed for how do you get more Bitcoin— and in our view Bitcoin treasury companies offer the best solution to that question. Um that that state of enthusiasm and and a state of uh you know bleak uh lack of enthusiasm, you know, or people thinking that that it maybe it's over or maybe it can't work. Uh and and that makes things hard when MNAV conditions come down to one or below. Um granted there are still things you can do and you know I've I've mentioned already that um elsewhere that you know there— we were— we are excited about the things that we can do under 1x MNAV. However we haven't been able to do them because of the uplisting process and and the sort of regulatory requirements on pausing certain certain activities. Um, and so hope, you know, in a weird way, if we get sub 1x MNAV conditions again, uh, I'm a little excited about what we can do to deliver shareholder value when that happens. But, you know, also wouldn't be the the worst thing if we don't have have those conditions again.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:05:22) Um the most important thing is that we've got options there, you know. So um you know obviously everyone's got their own ideas of what a Bitcoin treasury company should do, can do, will do, different stages, different geographies. Um but from our point of view, um purely from a Smarter Web point of view in the UK, um we've got options in all market conditions and that's what we've said at all times. You know, when you've got a very large growing balance sheet, um, you can do lots of things if you're in a sub one. Um, and you can do lots of things when you're above one. Um, you know, we've also got the advantage that, you know, we've got liquidity. You know, that Sunday Times, uh, Saturday Times article that came out last week showed um, people that don't follow our company, how liquid we are as a stock, you know, in the top 10 in the UK— that was on the buy side. I'm sure we're just out of the top 10 on the sell side. It would be unusual if you weren't in both sides. Um, so you know, we've got liquidity which allows us to have an ATM style facility. We've got demand from both retail and institutional. So that allows placings, subscriptions, that sort of stuff. And a whole host of different things that you can do in all different market conditions. So you know what what you need as a company is you need the toolkit which lets you deliver what you're trying to do in all market conditions because you cannot control the market. Um now clearly for the last couple of months we've had our hands tied to a degree. Um and that's been frustrating. Um but you know moving forward you know it's it's an incredibly exciting time for us all because whatever happens we've got options. Um, and I think that's what we want. Um, and I think that's what our shareholders want as well.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:07:05) Yeah, that's right. And and maybe that segues into um, you know, I guess what has happened over the last few months with regard to share price and and MNAV. Um, you know, globally, sector-wide, Bitcoin treasury companies have seen their MNAV compressed since mid-summer. Uh and many of them— I think most of them— got to an under 1x MNAV state. I think that was fueling a lot of uh end-of-year tax loss harvesting uh which was additional sell pressure um which drove MNAVs significantly below 1x MNAV. I think we bottomed at 0.69x MNAV, which which— again I I— if we if we happen to be in those conditions again, I'm almost excited about what we can do now or or once we're hopefully uh on the London Stock Exchange. Um but but also would not would not mind if we never revisit that as well. But so that was our our MNAV bottom right at the end of December. And since then we've uh seen the end of that sell pressure from tax loss harvesting and uh sort of relief coming back into the stock, back into the MNAV. We reached about 1.2 MNAV um about you know earlier this week or last week. Um, and and yeah, and and we're up 50%. The share price is up 50% for 2026 already, which is a pretty darn good start. You know, if you think about how uh 2025 was a plus 1,200% share price year. Yes, there was a a a big spike and then a lot of pain after that, but you know, from IPO to end of year, share price was up 1,200%. Now we're off to another great start for the year. Uh and and that has brought a shift of sentiment that that you've felt and and I've felt about um Bitcoin treasury company investors have now remembered that uh a Bitcoin treasury company's value proposition is at at least the Bitcoin that it holds on its balance sheet and hopefully additional Bitcoin yield on top of that, you know, through the through the efforts of management into the future increasing Bitcoin per share. Um and so when you get to the opportunity to buy Bitcoin at 69% of its price, I think that's where um buyers were stepping in at the same time that tax loss harvesters were trying to lock that in for the year. Um, and we've seen a swing in sentiment that has brought in a reminder to everyone what the value proposition of a Bitcoin treasury company is and especially what the value proposition of the leading Bitcoin treasury company in a significant capital market is, which is, you know, we're in a great position to keep running this playbook, keep delivering Bitcoin yield, keep growing that balance sheet, and then in the future hopefully get to a place where we can, you know, offer the kind of products that Strategy or MetaPlanet um are able to.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:09:55) Very well said there, Jesse.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:09:58) Um I got on a little rant there, so sorry about that.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:10:02) There's a question that I've got for you that on on that in a minute, but before we do the question, um that brings us quite nicely on to, you know, the sort of the different stages of a Bitcoin treasury company. Um and to how we've seen it up until this point. Um so I think one of the things that maybe I've been criticized for a little bit is the cautiousness um that I've taken. So I think everyone can see that we're quite ambitious in terms of where we're trying to be, how we're trying to grow, but you know, I make no apologies for the caution that I um sort of run the business with because the most important thing for me and and I hope for most of our shareholders is that the business is successful over the medium to long term. Ideally every single quarter um but certainly the medium to long term. And what I won't do is I won't take um unnecessary risks um because I I I don't think we need to um because it's so important that we do everything in the right way if we're going to get to be be where we want to be. And and indeed um I think one of the reasons why um the prospectus was um approved um you know was was was the effort that we put into running the business in a way that the authorities as well as all of the advisers you know support. Um so I think it's just all about doing things at the right point in the right time. Um if we look at the companies— so that's MetaPlanet, Strive and and Strategy— that have got prefs, they are bigger than us at the moment um and and that allows them to do different things. Um so our focus right now is to to get bigger— two times, three times, four times, whatever— um the size in a in a similar way to how we're doing it. Um and and then we've got other options in front of us. Um so that's incredibly exciting. Um, but I don't know whether you want to give everyone a sneak preview of um— that's a good idea— something that we've been working on. Um, you know, I I um, I'll give it a slight disclaimer that this is um, this is this is this is not about the Smarter Web Company. This is just some analysis of the UK that we've been doing. Um, over to you Jesse. I don't want to steal the—

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:12:15) No, that's perfect. Um yeah, as Andrew mentioned, this is something we've kind of been working on in the background. Um many people will be familiar with this slide. Uh and and then the the UK, the uh pounds version of it here. Uh and we've been trying to take stock of how much capital is in the UK as a capital market. Um which isn't to say what's the wealth of the UK, but specifically how much capital uh resides there, whether or not it's owned by um by foreigners or um and and also, you know, UK individuals and entities owning foreign stocks um and and other instruments. So all of that added up um is— this is our current analysis and and estimate of the UK asset landscape— and we believe there's 46 trillion pounds of capital that the the UK commands. And some of these you know are somewhat rough estimates uh in order to keep it in line with the uh global asset landscape chart but the main takeaways here— which Smarter Web investors may be interested in— uh is that the UK no surprise is a highly financialized economy and so it is disproportionately uh equities and money. Uh interestingly so— if you can see kind of the the relative size of the equities and the money buckets in the UK— they're they're disproportionately larger and that's because of uh the UK's legacy uh of the British Empire and being, you know, the world's first modern financial hub. So, it's still a top two global capital market. Um, it's the, you know, the home of banking for much of the world and that's where the money number is especially large. Um, and but that's also true for, you know, for equities. There's a lot of of capital that is based out of the UK whether that is UK holders you know with with money in foreign stocks um for example the the LSE UK listed companies is is about 2.9 trillion pounds uh so that's the value of the companies listed in the UK but this also includes the value of foreign stocks held by the UK um and and and also you know some other pieces too. But, uh, this is the the lens we have right now. Um, what's exciting about this to me is that it says there's a lot of capital. Uh, it says there's a lot of capital in equities and there's a lot of capital in the money market and also in the bond market. Um, and you know that like everywhere else in the world, the money market capital and the bond market capital is not getting great returns. Uh, that's just how it is. Um you know the— if if you're in bonds you're getting four or five percent— uh money market something like that as well— and and that's where Micro Strategy uh is making a big splash because their preferred equity instruments are targeting the fixed income market, the bond market here um and now the money market with with Stretch uh and they are offering you know 10, 11, 13% yield builds uh because Micro Strategy believes that Bitcoin will appreciate at 30% a year. Uh and so they're willing to pay the cost of capital of 11% a year in order to get capital, buy Bitcoin with it, and share the upside with with their fixed income investors um by by servicing those dividend payments as they're structured. Uh and that's what you know Micro Strategy is now pioneered in the US. Saylor very recently uh was on a podcast and quite directly said that uh they as of now uh have no intention to launch these products in the UK. They have done that in— they have launched a product in Europe— but they have no intention to do it in the UK. Uh he didn't explain why um but he— from his prior comments and from from this you know uh these comments— it is clear that he thinks it's a huge opportunity for whichever company uh can do that. So that's a fair bit down the road for us but this is our latest analysis that we're excited about just because it it it it does create um— it clarifies just how much capital is in the UK. The reality that the UK is a a a huge home of capital and that um you know within that regulatory environment there's not currently a way to get for example Bitcoin-powered fixed income um returns.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:16:30) So also if you look at the equity slice there um and you assume that you know just under three trillion is is the UK listed equities um so ignoring the overseas equities owned by UK individuals— just under three trillion— um and then you think about where we're heading and the potential for index inclusion um starting almost immediately with the Footsie Small Cap and we believe in the not too distant future, the Footsie 250 and onwards and upwards from there. Um the the opportunity is staggering. Um you know, if you've got a company that's well supported, that can raise capital, that's listed on the right venue, um the opportunity is is incredible. Um you know, with with the passive flows as well as the medium to long-term options that are in front of us. So, you know, when Jesse put this together, um, we've been talking about it for some time and and and, um, and it came together fairly recently, this this thing that we've been working on, this slide, um, you know, I was blown away. You know, the the the the chunk of the equities is is bigger than I expected. And then when I look at the UK alongside the the global landscape and I look about how disproportionate it is compared with what everyone thinks it it makes it very very clear to me and I think most people that the UK is the number two capital market in the world. If you had asked me that question without us doing the work to get the data— or better said Jesse doing the work to to get the data— I would have probably said it's in the top five. Um um so yeah, the the opportunity is vast and you know this just adds to the excitement that we've got.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:18:18) Yeah, that— for for folks— that was the first question that that Andrew asked me once I showed him the numbers was you know he wanted to to figure out— wait a second where is this equities? What what's what's going into these equities— this equity number and what are the pieces? So I shared my work there and and you know luckily I had some some solid numbers that that comprised the equities piece. But I think that's the real— that's probably the number one takeaway— is that everybody thinks of the UK as being limited in terms of equity value to what's there on the London Stock Exchange. But but that's not a true view of the amount of capital that's invested in stocks and private companies. So this, you know, equities piece includes private companies in the UK and private companies internationally. So that's part of how it it gets so large. Um, but that's all equity capital and you know, if Smarter Web can outperform other equity investment options for UK capital uh consistently, then that— this is the total addressable market for capital that might be interested in Smarter Web as an equity. Um, okay. Yes. Well, that was— We'll stop that. That's a fun little sneak peek for for the folks watching the stream. Um, we hope to put that out uh in the future. Um, but for now, that's all you get.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:19:42) Um, yeah.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:19:44) So, so Andrew, maybe we can um walk through the process that that you know, everybody who's an investor has been on the outside watching and and from their point of view, it's just all of a sudden now we're talking about our intention to uplist to the to the LSE. Um so, would you like to kind of walk through like what has to happen and what we are in the midst of and kind of where we are in that process?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:20:08) Yeah, sure. Well, let's briefly go about it from the start of the process. Um, so you make a decision. It's as simple as that. You decide that you want to list on the London Stock Exchange, um, as a management team or, you know, whatever. Um, you engage with the appropriate advisers for that. Um, there's there's more advisers than if you were doing that on the Aquis market, um, slightly. Um and then you start doing the work. Um ultimately what you're working towards is you're working towards getting a uh prospectus um because that's the document that has to go out before that process can take place. The way the prospectus works is you create the prospectus. Um, you know, it does take a lot of time. Um, and then at some point when it's ready, you submit that to the FCA and they have a a formal process where um, you get feedback, put it back in, feedback, put it back in, so on and so forth. They call it a turn of the prospectus. Um, and then you get to a point at which they say you're clear of comments. Uh which means that it's almost signed off. Um and then you submit the prospectus and then you get that back very very quickly— within hours in our case. Um and that's the you know the stamped prospectus which then has to be published immediately. Um so in our case uh call it half an hour, an hour, something like that from when it was approved to when everyone could see it. Um approximately. Um when you get close to that point um you can decide to— if you're a public company like us— you can decide to announce that which is what we did a few days before um because we felt that there was enough confidence then that everything would be okay. Um you know in our opinion um and the reason why we also did that then is because you have to put out your notice to leave— a you know Aquis in our case, whatever market you're on. Um, and then we we felt that we could shorten that notice period ever so slightly um because it doesn't disadvantage the shareholders in our opinion. Um, but in order to do that, you need to call a— in our case, because of the way that our company, our resolutions are structured, uh, our articles are structured— you you need to to call a general meeting which takes place next Wednesday at 9:00 a.m. Um, you know, it's something that people have voted for remotely. There— it's not like a meeting that will be interesting to attend or anything like that. Um, it's just a formal script that gets read out a lot like when we did the meeting um, in December. Um and then at the end of that meeting there's a vote. You know the majority of the votes would come in online. Um and then you know there— people that would vote in place which may only be me um on on on that day. Um well it would be two people because you need a quorum. So there's there's one shareholder— may— another shareholder I know will be there and hopefully they'll both vote in favor of it. Um and and and and then there's a bit more sort of process that happens behind the scenes that um happens between our advisers and the FCA. Alongside that, um we have um you know the the plans that go into the ceremony. Um so on the day that you start trading on the London Stock Exchange, they invite you to open the market. Um I've never been to one of those before. Um and I'm very much looking forward to going to it. We've invited you know obviously the team um the advisers. I wanted to invite some shareholders. So that's why some of you may have seen that we we we published a raffle earlier where we can um then at random pick the um the number of tickets that we can allocate to our shareholders so that they can be part of the the the the opening as well. Um on that day effectively turn up at the London Stock Exchange half past 7 in the morning with photo ID so they let you in. Um and then um you have the thing on the balcony that people have seen the photos of um and then the the stocks trading on one venue and not trading on another venue. Um so yeah, you know, I know I've said it a fair few times, but a lot of work goes into that. Um you know, we're on the home straight with that now. It's just the formalities now. Um, and then from there, um, you know, you're you're you're you're doing exactly what we've done before, really, speaking to investors, communicating with shareholders, trying to grow our our operating business alongside that, growing our treasury function, um, and, you know, sort of, um, progressing from there really. So yeah, it's it's a hell of a lot of work, but you know, the whole team have done incredibly well to get us to this point and um yeah, I'm really proud of everyone that's worked on it, you know, for the benefit of the shareholders.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:24:35) It's a a a major achievement for the company. Um I'm very excited about it. I'll I'll be there. It'll be actually my first trip for Smarter Web to the UK uh is is for the uplisting. Um, I'm also excited to to be right there in in the city of London, um, right next to next to St. Paul's Cathedral. I I was telling Andrew the other day, I have a very vivid memory from a trip to London 21 years ago where I I visited St. Paul's and was completely confused why there were so many people rushing around in pinstriped suits looking extremely sharp. Uh, and I have never known the answer for 21 years. And now I discover, oh, it's because the London Stock Exchange is next door. So those were all stock brokers rushing around 21 years ago. Now that makes sense. So I'm very excited about uh coming out for that event and and the meetings that we will be having um with investors in the city um around that and also the opportunity to to meet some of the community um at at at the uplisting itself and um the drinks we're arranging uh on the side as well. Um and and yeah, just to underline, you know, I think there's a— I think it it it it shouldn't be overlooked or uh downplayed what a big achievement this is. Um because this is this is a bit of a a landmark for Bitcoin— for for this model— um in the you know top two capital market in the world. London is known as as a high regulation environment. Uh and very recently in in another high regulation environment in Switzerland um an upstart Bitcoin treasury company was was kind of denied access and and they had to change their plans and and uh are no longer launching. So, you know, for Smarter Web to have navigated over the last nine months to to go from, you know, having to only speak about having a digital assets treasury policy, including Bitcoin, to now being able to talk about our intention to accumulate Bitcoin. Um, the fact that we care about uh Bitcoin yield as a concept and that MNAV is is a part of how people should, you know, evaluate these businesses. Uh and that the FCA, the regulator, has approved that and accepted that as a valid thing to be doing. Uh and and you know that Smarter Web has figured out the right way to do that. Um is I think a big moment for for Bitcoin in the UK at least.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:27:05) Yeah, I completely agree. You know, if if people had said to me 9 10 months ago that, you know, we would be able to have the prospectus as as it is with, you know, not only the operating business, of course, but, you know, the the Bitcoin aspect of of how we run our treasury with, you know, approved definitions like Bitcoin yield and MNAV and, you know, using Bitcoin per share as one of the things that we use to assess our performance. Um, I I would have said that, you know, maybe one day, but maybe not not quite this soon. And and and you know, everyone's got their own opinions of different things, but my experience with the FCA has has been first class. Um, I've been really impressed with um, you know, how they've looked at what we're trying to do and the questions that they've asked. They asked the questions for the right reasons. You know, they they are just trying to regulate a a very important market um to protect investors. So, it's right that they are tough um but they've been open-minded and and they've they've they've they've listened to what we believe in and and how we think a modern business should be structured. Um and yeah, I've been I've been actually very impressed with them.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:28:25) Um, I think it it probably also helps uh when our advisers and the team led by you Andrew put together such a a thorough and excellent prospectus document for them to be considering. Uh, for folks who haven't seen our prospectus yet, which is now published— public— um, you can go find this document on our website and and and you can look through all the details. Uh of what Smarter Web is is proclaiming itself to be and all the all the the guts of uh financial information um and also our you know strategy and and governance composition as well. So there's a— it's quite a long document. We won't go through it here but um suffice to say that it's available for folks who want to go through all of the um the nitty-gritty on their own. Um great. Okay. So maybe now would be um a good time to transition to— you know so the uplisting is happening. Uh that's very a very exciting time. Oh, I I'll also kind of toss in that um we are going from an environment, the Aquis market, where we have been about 60% of the traded volume uh during the time that we've been listed there. Uh and we're now going to a a market with $2.9 trillion of of of capital listed there and a lot of volume and we will be a tiny portion of of the volume. Um, I think that should be uh a big deal um for the company for uh access really for global capital, UK capital and global capital to Smarter Web Company um and and hopefully allows us to to have considerably more uh trading trading volume. It also happens to coincide with an interesting new uh initiative that the FCA has approved of um having no stamp duty tax uh for LSE listed companies for the first three years that they're that they're listed uh which will apply to us. Um the details of how that is is implemented and and tracked uh surprisingly still kind of being formed. Um but that is that is already in in effect uh and and a very good thing for for us because we are a— we are a high volatility stock um in a good way. Uh traditional, you know, TradFi is afraid of volatility because volatile days tend to be negative for traditional equities and traditional bonds, which is to say that, you know, if you have a a a big move, um it tends to be a down day. You know, it tends to be a move down. Um but for Bitcoin it's the opposite where you know you have your histogram of of um of daily returns sort of a bell curve and then you've got a cluster of really really strong positive days. So it's a a fat tail to the right. Um and that's great. That's what everyone— that's the holy grail really— is something that that where volatility um is a good thing and the more volatile the better in that case. You want big moves if the moves tend to be to the positive. Now Bitcoin has 30% annualized vol. Uh right now uh Smarter Web has about 110% annualized vol. So we are considerably more volatile than Bitcoin. We are not correlated with Bitcoin but because it's a it's a Bitcoin um strategy at its heart it's it's good vol in the same way that Bitcoin is is good vol. So all that to say that um we— Smarter Web I think presents a a pretty unique value proposition to London capital markets where we are considerably more volatile than any of the other companies in the in the Footsie 250 or 100 um and that volatility is good and there's also no taxes on trading um our stock for the next three years. So hopefully those conditions um are are appreciated by some cohort of capital in in London and puts us in a in a unique position to be attractive when many other companies don't have uh you know reason to be interesting to traders out there. Um some other thoughts on on LSE before we we move on?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:32:25) But yeah, now we can sort of move on Andrew to— I guess uh— would love to get your perspective on Bitcoin treasury companies in 2026 uh and Bitcoin at at this current moment. You know, maybe a little bit of reflection on the last six months and and sort of thoughts on, you know, where we're at and and and how the market is is uh shaping up right now.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:32:48) Yeah. So, well, let's start with Bitcoin treasury companies. Um so, as we all know, the last few months, um you know, the last quarter, just longer of last year were tough for Bitcoin treasury companies. If you look at us as a good example, um ignoring the share price side of things, um this week is the first week in almost three months where we've announced a purchase of Bitcoin. Um you know, and and you know, that was a long gap um because of the access to capital effectively. Um so all Bitcoin treasury companies um have found it tough. Um, all of them, as far as I'm aware, um, have taken a a hit with their share prices. Um, and most of them— the smaller ones, the medium-sized ones, basically everyone that doesn't do prefs— um, has found it very difficult to buy meaningful amounts of Bitcoin over that time period. Um, there's lots of reasons why that all happened. Um probably not needing to go into them all at the moment. Um but looking at the positive, what we believe is that we're coming out that other window. You know, the— you know, if if it's— if it's every now and then you get a bad three months, then you know, that's that's not a bad sort of cycle to operate in. Um so, you know, over the next couple of years, we'll have to see how those cycles materialize in terms of that. What I believe is that Bitcoin treasury companies that have got a a reasonable history of delivering Bitcoin yield perhaps won't get treated so so badly in that scenario. Um you know taking that in in the context of what I said earlier about companies like ours do have options in a good and a bad market. Um so you know we'll see how that one plays out. If I look at Strategy as an example, you know, they're— from from the start, you know, five and a bit years ago. Um, premium, quite a long discount. Premium— dependent on who you look at— and now, you know, close to a one. My personal opinion is I don't think they went below one, but I've seen some people say they have. And, you know, you can slice these things up however you wish. Um, so maybe that's the sort of the cycle, you know, and if that's as bad as it gets, you know, you go down to a one um in the bad times, then, you know, we can probably live with that. Um, you know, with with the upside potential that that is on offer. Um, so I think we're probably one of the first um Bitcoin treasury companies, all being well, to start, you know, buying Bitcoin again because we believe that the capital is flowing again. Then um you know obviously there's no guarantees what happens in the very very near future but everything's looking good from where I'm sat.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:35:32) Um and then if we go on to Bitcoin. So probably quite an unpopular comment I'm about to make. So cover your ears if you don't want to hear it. Um I'm kind of glad that Bitcoin put in a negative year in 2025. Um you know if I look at what we achieved in 2025 when Bitcoin was you know flat, down slightly, up— you know dependent on which part of the year you're looking at— let's call let's call it flat um just for argument's sake— um we achieved a lot. Um we went from almost zero um to over 2 and a half thousand Bitcoin held. Um if we can perform like that when Bitcoin is not helping us out— bearing in mind that Bitcoin is our treasury asset— then imagine what we can do in a good Bitcoin environment. Now, my personal opinion, um, and that's all it is, a personal opinion, is that Bitcoin is going to have an incredible year this year. Um for lots of reasons, not just because it had a down year, more the fundamental structure of Bitcoin in terms of why I like Bitcoin, which is basically a fixed supply and no one in control of it, overlaid with the thing that I don't like to like, if that makes sense, which is the mess that the world is becoming. Um, and it's a perfect environment for Bitcoin, as much as it troubles me to say that in in some ways. So, you know, with my belief that Bitcoin is going to have a good year for lots of other reasons in addition to that and the way that we're structured and what we did when Bitcoin wasn't really doing anything too crazy. Um, I think it's pretty incredible. The only other thing that I would add is, you know, let's say that this was, you know, the the dip in Bitcoin, you know, what, 25% off off the all-time high, something like that, which is nothing compared with what we've seen in the in the past. Now, if that's as bad as it gets— Bitcoin dipping 25%— as it goes to 1, 2, 5, 10 million over whatever time period it does, if you believe that. Um which not everyone will believe. Um it's pretty good.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:37:45) Yeah. Yeah, I'll take— I would take that. Um yeah, I think that's I think that's right that you know increasingly I kind of have the view that we may have just had a bare market uh for Bitcoin and and it might have been largely absorbed by Bitcoin treasury companies. Um, in particular, Strategy. Um, it's it's well known that Strategy has, you know, incredibly deep options chain. Uh, the liquidity there is pretty incredible. And uh if you were trying to play the sort of four-year cycle, a a very good way to go about it would be to, you know, short Micro Strategy via options uh in order to hedge your position if you're long Bitcoin, if you're a Bitcoin whale. And uh it seems like that may have been going on over the last six months in particular. Um in in which case, you know, Micro Strategy's stock takes a lot of the a lot of the brunt. Uh and then downstream of that, you know, is MetaPlanet, which has had a pretty huge compression of MNAV. Um and then, you know, the smaller Bitcoin treasury companies beyond that like Smarter Web, um feel an even more amplified version of of that compression. Uh incidentally also um— you know it's a bit of a tangent here but— we are excited to be attending Strategy World uh coming up here. Um Andrew you will be uh on stage there on a panel. Um it seems to us— or to me at least— that uh Saylor has kind of handpicked a few Bitcoin treasury companies that he particularly likes in capital markets that he finds particularly attractive that Strategy does not intend to compete with um and has invited those companies to participate in his event. So it'll— you know you'll be on stage with uh folks from MetaPlanet uh Capital B and and Orange— so Japan, Europe and Brazil and the UK. Um it's kind of a— in my view— somewhat telling um handpicked bunch that that I think he he did quite deliberately. So we're excited about that. We're excited about um Saylor's continued support and enthusiasm for Smarter Web in the— and the UK capital market as an opportunity. Um but yeah, I agree with that that that view of Bitcoin. It's quite possible that we're in a fantastic position for 2026 from a Bitcoin perspective. Um, for me, the big story is gold and silver have been running hard. Uh, and Bitcoin has lagged. Uh and you know on on Twitter you you start to see a lot of uh uh precious metal fans, gold bugs um dunking on Bitcoiners. Certainly, I've noticed the uptick of of uh of taunts from gold fans and uh and that is a good sign, frankly, because you know, Bitcoin will not always outperform gold on every time frame, but uh in general, it will outperform gold in my view. And uh so you know I think we're probably due for a rotation because the world continues to to misunderstand Bitcoin and believe it's a risk-on asset. It's not a risk-on asset. It is a neutral reserve asset for the digital era. It is gold for the digital age. And so if the value proposition of gold and silver makes sense to global capital right now, wait until they, you know, until the mechanics of Bitcoin um continue to tighten uh and and new supply issuance continues to go down. With with the silver rally in particular— it's it's funny because silver is one of the commodities that when the the price goes up a lot, it becomes economical to turn back on a lot of mining operations around the world. So supply will increase in in reaction to the the price going up and that of course will eventually hammer the the current market price of silver back downwards um as that supply comes online. Not true of Bitcoin obviously. That's why— that's a big part of why we're here. But I think that backdrop is very good for Bitcoin and that is very good for Bitcoin treasury companies because you and I talk about this a lot that you know the— a big part of the reason I'm confident that sentiment will always cycle for Bitcoin treasury companies is that sentiment cycles for Bitcoin. Um, and when people are enthusiastic about Bitcoin, when they want more of it, what do what do you turn to? What's the best way to get to grow your Bitcoin ownership? My belief is the best way to grow your Bitcoin ownership is through a well-run Bitcoin treasury company. And and when people are thinking in those ways, it makes sense to pay a premium to participate in in a company that that is running that playbook. Uh and that you know creates the MNAV premium uh and then begets you know more yield and that begets a higher MNAV premium and it's recursive— it's reflexive— and and it is also recursive and reflexive in the other direction when conditions change but what we're talking about is cyclical. Fundamentally there'll be good times and bad times but overall will always be— over the next 20 years— a desire for people to grow their Bitcoin ownership. Um because Bitcoin will continue to win and will continue to prove itself as the best asset for the 21st century. Uh and people will feel late and they will want more Bitcoin and and we will be running our playbook.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:42:42) Also, when you link into that all of the passive flows as well. So, let's say you're a a a UK mid-cap manager, for example, um or or even you've got a mandate over the whole of the UK in terms of equities, you know, you'll be benchmarked against an index, you know, Footsie 250, Footsie 100, etc. Um, so if there's stocks in that index that are outperforming that index because they've decided to build their balance sheet on the best asset that the world's ever seen, um, then, you know, it's not just the passive money that that can potentially flow into your company. It's the active managers that get forced to buy you whether they like it or not because they have to keep up with the performance. Um, so there's an awful lot to be excited about and you know, if you've got to give it to the, you know, the silver and the gold bugs for one year out of, I don't know, 20 or whatever it is, then, you know, I think that's pretty reasonable, you know.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:43:38) Yeah, we're doing— we're doing pretty— we're doing okay. We're doing okay as an asset. Um, great. Uh, and and just sort of looking at my notes to sort of couple topics to wrap up on. Um let's let's address a sort of Bitcoin yield quarter to date. Uh and and and also the related question of— okay you guys recently raised some some capital through the ATM style instrument— um how are you thinking about that and and and also you in the context of uplisting?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:44:08) Yeah sure. Um so if I just explain how the maths works, that's probably the the starting point. Um so when we raise some money through the ATM style um facility that we've got um we effectively sell some shares and we get some money. Um when we announced that on a Monday morning normally um we put the shares into the fully diluted calculation um and and so we've increased the shares and the Bitcoin has remained static um in— the cash that results from that um is effectively held in the business, the group, and then it's used for— whether it's for growing the operating business or for the PLC cost or put it into the treasury or a combination of all those things. Um then if we look back at the announcement that we just made, we moved a certain amount of money um into the the treasury um and we bought Bitcoin with it. So so what you get over that event is at the start you effectively get a a hit on your Bitcoin yield. Um, so when we're starting at zero, it went down to I think 0.8 or something like that— 0.83 for memory— minus 0.83. Um, and then when the Bitcoin purchase was announced, it went up to around about half a percent— so negative half a percent at the moment. Um, and you know, obviously we can't say any more than what's publicly available about exactly how much cash we've got. Um, but but that's how that works. So, if you think through capital raising strategies, you know, obviously the higher the MNAV, the easier it is to generate that positive Bitcoin yield. Um, but then there's things that you can do on the on the negative scenario as well. Um, so, you know, it's all transparent. If you look in the in the prospectus, you can see that our listing— which is good value— um you know, if you tried to find another main market um listing that that's done for one and a half million pounds, I think it might be quite difficult. And most of the ones I've looked at are considerably more. Um so things like that, you know, clearly we've got, you know, a way that we run the cash in the business in addition to the modest revenues that come in um you know, to to manage that side of things, but you know, some of the cash is used for things like that. I think if you look at the um the the the benefit that we'll get from the LSE move then I think that you know one and a half million pounds is is is is easily worth you know that that investment and and— it's too short a window— but if you look at the share price you can see um the value versus the—

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:46:35) Yeah as you've you've pointed out on another podcast already it's a good lens to look at it is um that it's already delivered quite a bit of value. Just the announcement that that we're very close to that point in time has brought um quite a rally to the stock and it added 100 million pounds of shareholder value. Um so you know if you think about it in those simple terms it's already been extremely good return for shareholders.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:47:00) Um, sorry, I agree. Didn't mean to to cut off any additional thoughts you had there.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:47:05) No, no problem. Just because I'm conscious of time, um, it might be worth just briefly mentioning the conference that we've announced as well.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:47:15) Yeah, that's that's what I was I was going to wrap— our final point with— um, you know, what what do you want to say about upcoming events? We've got um a very very minor general meeting coming up for um the the move to LSE. We have the— then the uplisting which we're targeting the 3rd of February for— um and some events around that in London. Uh then we've got the the annual general meeting coming up on the horizon and and then the our recently announced uh collaboration with Bitcoin Treasuries Media, Tim Kotzman and and Ed Julene um for the Bitcoin uh Unconference in May 29th um in Bristol coming up. So, anything you want to say about any of those events um and and where people can find out more about those events too?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:48:00) Yeah, sure. So, um the meeting next week is is a formality um and all being well, that will be announced very shortly after the meeting, you know, on the same day. Um with with the the percentage voting um you know, and how that's split.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:48:18) Um the AGM, we're we're going to hopefully have a few— well maybe more than a few— shareholders come to it. So that will be announced in due course as well. Um you know I'm hoping that that will be in in in March because it's a statutory thing when the AGM's got to be held— six months from the year end, accounts out within four months of the year end. We're planning in Bristol for that too.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:48:42) Yeah. Yeah. We're going to do it at the Concord Museum um again because it was a good venue for that sort of a thing. Um so— and I look forward to going to that one.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:48:52) Yeah, it'll be good. And and and you can have a look around Concord as well. Another, you know, British and French uh engineering success story. Um yeah, so that'll be good. Um I'm really looking forward to going to Strategy World. I think it's one of the best events um on the calendar and I'm delighted that we were invited to talk there. Um you know, that's that's um humbling. Um, and I'm looking forward to talking around your new UK landscape slide in addition to a few other things there. Um, because that's that's our bit. We'll be talking about the the the UK opportunity and and what we're doing in the UK. And, you know, we've got some good slides um, you know, already prepared for that. Um, and then of course the Unconference. So, we we wanted to do an event um you know, specifically around Bitcoin treasury companies and and and what we're doing for for for a while. Um and then the opportunity came up and we were chatting to them a while ago. They wanted to do something um in the UK. They're trying to do stuff globally. Uh we wanted to do something and it was an obvious partnership. So, we said, "Well, let's organize it together." Um I selfishly said, "Why don't we do it in Bristol?" And and and no one overruled that one. So that's where it's happening. Um and then we've got some support from some amazing speakers. I wanted— the idea behind the conference is that we have a really good day of content. Um so you know I've got a rough agenda with all the different speakers although we have had some more speakers— some not yet announced. Um and um and and I'm trying to make sure that that the day is is is a brilliant day of content with a mixture of keynotes and panels. And then we've got some support from some amazing sponsors. Um quite a few of those have actually reached out— potential sponsors— since we went public with that um on Monday I think it was. Um so so that's good. Um and yeah, I'm hoping it's a good day um so that then we can build on that into the future. And I was very keen that we can use it as an opportunity for all Bitcoin treasury companies both private and public in the UK. Um and then a a group of our friends from the global stage um you know to to bring their perspectives into it. Um so you know we'll have to wait and see how it goes but um I'm I'm hoping that it will be a great day and we're going to certainly do our best um to make it enjoyable for everyone.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:51:15) Yeah, it was a— we obviously went to the the inaugural one in New York City and it was a phenomenal event. Um great format uh just kind of in the round there with the audience and and and the stage right in the middle. Um and the the programming was excellent and obviously New York City is the the the world's center for capital markets. Uh but the UK is number two as we know now in particular. Um through through this analysis UK is is the second most important uh capital hub in the world. Uh and this will— this day, this conference— will be a um you know the the second uh edition of— in a location— of the Bitcoin Unconference. I think it's fitting it'll be in the UK and it will be a celebration of Bitcoin in the UK. So, I think we're we're striking a nice balance of inviting in everyone who's doing interesting things with Bitcoin treasuries and Bitcoin in general in the UK um and then also getting, you know, international perspectives um from from our our friends in the Bitcoin treasury landscape uh internationally. So, um really looking forward to that. I think it'll be a big event for Bitcoin in the UK. Um, and and of course in particular, Bitcoin treasuries as a concept in UK capital markets. This is going to be kind of a a landmark moment because nobody's done a conference in the UK about Bitcoin treasuries and I think it will be um a a mega trend that will continue to play out over the next couple decades. So, you know, this will be a a cool event to have been at. Um at the at the very start of Bitcoin treasuries in the UK.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:52:55) And in terms of the tickets for that, if you did want to buy one, you can use the code "offer10". Um that will get you 10% off. Um the VIP tickets where you get invited to a dinner in the evening uh with the speakers and the sponsors um and other investors. Um those tickets are selling quicker than the non-VIP ones. Um, so, um, yeah, if you want to buy a ticket, visit our website. Um, it's really easy, um, to complete the form there. Um, and and we look forward to seeing you there.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:53:25) Great. Okay. Yeah. Well, I guess we'll we'll end it there. This this was our our first livestream together. Um, you know, I've never really been in this this this role. Uh, so folks, let me know how how I did, what I can do better next time, and we will plan on doing more sessions like these. Uh probably once a month, maybe every few weeks. Um yeah. All right. Thanks very much everyone.
