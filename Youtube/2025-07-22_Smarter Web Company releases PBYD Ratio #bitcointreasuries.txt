**Vostra:**
Wra here. I wanted to make a video about the new PE ratio research um report that has come out from the Smarter Web Company. The Smarter Web Company, PLC, the fastest growing company in the UK, building Bitcoin on its balance sheet, so buying bitcoins, has just published the PE ratio concept for Bitcoin Treasury companies. I wanted to go into this a little bit more and take a step back. The Bitcoin treasury company world was started by strategy, formerly known as Micro Strategy. And the industry essentially uses public markets to raise funds and purchase Bitcoin. It creates shareholder value through the establishment of Bitcoin treasuries. It creates value through its speed at purchasing Bitcoin and um turning capital markets into the asset Bitcoin which is now formally recognized as the apex asset for most of the financial world that understands the asset. Now I say most of the financial world that understands the asset because there is a lot of understanding to be done here. What we are witnessing with Bitcoin treasury companies, public Bitcoin treasury companies is the mergence of traditional finance and modern finance. Therefore, there is inevitably a phase of bridging um where the traditional finance world needs to catch up and get up to speed with what this whole business model uh is about. And one of the key fundamental areas um for investors to understand is valuation. um not only in a modern Bitcoin treasury company environment but just uh from a traditional finance point of view valuation is always a core critical area to uh understand thousands of business books have been written about this subject this goes to the core of economics um if you're trained in business and finance you understand the world in one way. You understand PE ratios, for example, price to earning ratios. You understand that companies on public markets trade at a multiple to their earnings, often doubledigit multiples, 10, 15, 20, not uncommon, 20 plus. In fact, we'll go through some examples that the uh SWC research brief highlights. With that all comes to how should we value Bitcoin treasury companies? What is the value they bring? In my basic opinion, I think that traditional finance markets still do not understand the power of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is underpinning all of this. The energy, how can traditional finance get up to speed with Bitcoin? and the valuation of a public market company that is involved in acquiring as much Bitcoin as it possibly can as quick as it possibly can. I cannot help but think that there are people walking in the financial center of London of all of the markets around the world scratching their heads thinking Jesus what is going on? What is going on? There is a a rush to buy as much Bitcoin as possible. The gold rush, the digital gold rush. Why is everyone buying Bitcoin? Bitcoin is going to zero. Bitcoin is a Ponzi. Bitcoin is a scam. Everything is a scam. We are now bridging that that financial world. Ladies and gentlemen, Michael Sailor with strategy has been doing this for several years. But over the last few months, especially the gates have opened, we are now entering a realm of unknown situations. People are bamboozled by the success of the smarter web company. No other business has IPOed in the same fashion as the Smarter Web Company has in the history of the United Kingdom. I cannot believe that this has fell upon the Vostra channel to dissect. I am absolutely in awe that I am talking about this and nobody else is in the UK. Well, so be it. Let's unpeel the pages of the smarter web company research the PE ratio for Bitcoin treasury companies called the P bid page one. I am going to not read everything word by word. You can find this document on the smarter web community pages in fact on the smart web company website. So therefore I urge you all to go there and download this. It was um published by Jesse Meyers. Bitcoin strategy of the smarter web company PLC. Page one. This discusses what you learn in accounting school. In business school, the price to earnings ratio, PE ratio. Apple trades at 33 PE ratio. Investors will have to wait 33 years to earn the cumulative profits equal to their investment today. 33 years. Here are the PE ratios for the world's most valuable public companies. 53 39 33 36 20 27. This is ladies and gentlemen a form of brainwashing. How can you pay 53 times earnings? But yet people do. And this is part of the Mag 7 group, the best performing companies in the world, right? Bitcoin treasury companies. As Michael Sailor likes to say, the only thing better than Bitcoin is more Bitcoin, right? And this is actually a great place to start because at the core of some of the debates is why should I invest in a Bitcoin treasury company when I can buy Bitcoin myself? Well, the whole point of investing through a Bitcoin treasury company is that they are able to multiply the bitcoins per share, compound the bitcoin per per share. Whereas, if you just buy it yourself, you will always have whatever bitcoin you have. And you should also have your own stash of Bitcoin. But if you want to grab as much as you can and in this environment where everyone is going after the bitcoin, there are only 21 million bitcoins, then if you want to super excel speed your accumulation indirectly, then using a bitcoin treasury company is a vehicle for that objective. As we say in this paper here, the explicit goal of increasing its Bitcoin holdings per share, you receive what's called a Bitcoin yield. What Bitcoin yield is effectively just the increase in Bitcoin's per share over a period of time. This term Bitcoin yield is up for debate. In traditional finance, when you talk about yield, you talk about receiving interest payments, you talk about receiving something, a benefit from holding something. Well, therein lies the first level of confusion. In my opinion, when you talk with traditional finance and the modern Bitcoin world, Bitcoin yield was a metric devised by Michael Sailor's strategy group to capsulate what the value proposition is for a Bitcoin treasury company. And I think Mr. Adam Beck has recently raised this subject. It makes me believe that there is some leg in trying to even potentially reverse this terminology because whilst it's understood very well by Bitcoin treasury company operators, the fact that this needs to be explained over and over again, there may be a better way to describe this. The purest version of this is accretive dilution. And again, accretion is the game here. If I quickly flick across to what Mr. Adam back the only person ever to be mentioned by the Satoshi white paper on Bitcoin who is currently active in the market that we can see has a thought around this term as well. Let's go to what Adam Bach has to say about yield. Adam Bach says accretion rate is greater than yield. What does he mean by this? Bitcoin treasury company terminology thought. Isn't it essentially the same? Only difference being that BTC yield is adjusted for dilution. Yes, I just mean as an alternative terminology for yield. I just think accretion is more accurate than yield. Terminology if you like. There you go, Mr. Vostra. I like it. Yield does confuse tradfi. I must admit I was jumping around when I got a like back from Mr. Adam back. It's a sacred digital blessing. I think we should change the Bitcoin yield terminology to accretion rate because that will then at least get over step one. What is it you are trying to do here? The whole game is increasing the percentage of your Bitcoin holdings per share. Moving on, this is an excellent diagram showing the whole business model of the issuance of equity, receiving cash, purchasing Bitcoin, and the accretive dilution of increasing your Bitcoin per share by a greater percentage than your dilution of your equity fundraisers. And there that then brings us to the other two key metrics that are used to value and understand a Bitcoin treasury company. Number one, the MNAV. The MNAV will be familiar to the traditional finance world. It is a multiple of your netbook value of your netbook assets. That is not a problem. The problem arises when they potentially do not understand why Bitcoin treasury companies can trade at a multiple at a significant multiple to their net assets value at times especially at the beginning of a startup treasury company environment. What justifies the MNAV? Should it be 3 2 1 5 10 15 20? Well, let's go back to where some of the MAG 7 trade at. They are trading at a price to earnings ratio of above 50 in some cases. Lowest is 20 Google as of 11th of July. Why does this matter? This gives you a perspective on why when valuing a Bitcoin treasury company, how the MNAV, the current MNAV, the trading MNAV, is effectively just a reflection of the premium that the market values the company compared to the value of the treasury, but also the pricing of its future ability to execute the strategy. That said, moving on to the days to cover metric. This is a very key essential metric to understand. It justifies MNAV premiums for Bitcoin treasury companies. If a Bitcoin treasury company is able to justify an MNAV, a high MNAV, it can point to its days to cover metric, which shows how many days ago that the company's Bitcoin per share was equal to the current Bitcoin per share. What in essence this is trying to show you is how long does it take for a Bitcoin treasury company to cover the additional premium that it trades at when you are first potentially investing in a bit Bitcoin treasury company. This is very key to understand. However, in isolation, trying to map that against traditional finance metrics is causing confusion and therefore enter enter the P bid ratio. The P bid ratio is an attempt to make the output of the metric into a similar format as you would a PE ratio for a traditional finance trading public company. So that the effectively the days to cover and the MNAV metrics are annualized and investors can understand how long it takes for the premium to be earned back as it were by the business. In other words, how long will it take to deliver enough BTC yield? That is the increase per bitcoins in share percentages to offset the MNAV premium paid up front. And it takes into account a time period that can enable you to understand the effectiveness of a treasury strategy over a defined time period. um often the most recent time period. Let's move on. The Bitcoin yield should be from the most recent period which can be one year, quarter or even a month. This helps to understand the latest execution capability of a business in terms of raising finance and turning that cash into Bitcoin. P bid is similar to days to cover, but different in that it returns in a number of years and allows the user to define a sample period of recent performance to try and help project forward rather than simply looking back in time. This is then a comparison of P bid ratios for Bitcoin treasury companies versus the um strategy Bitcoin treasury company, the MetaPlanet, Smarter Web that we all know about in the UK. Let's take a look. As of 15th of July, the P bid of strategy was 1.86 years. This means investors would have to wait under two years to earn the cumulative Bitcoin equal to their investment today and anything after that is additional Bitcoin gained. Better planet 0.38 years. The smarter web 0.09 09 years, 32 days. That's how fast. Inevitably, this yield and the rate decreases over time. But even we're factoring in the decrease. This is still fast. This is fast compared to any traditional finance business ever. Traditional finance does not understand what is happening. those mnavs, the higher those mnavs that you provide a Bitcoin treasury company or that the market views the Bitcoin treasury companies with, the more accreative the dilution can be and the faster that they can raise cash to buy the Bitcoin to then provide more value to shareholders. Underpinning all of this is Bitcoin. If you do not understand the power of Bitcoin, then this will not seem very intuitive to most investors. In fact, traditional finance will struggle to understand the yield, the race to buy as much Bitcoin as possible. If you have no idea about the power of Bitcoin, then unfortunately this will not be very helpful. What we must do in the world where we are bridging traditional finance versus modern finance is help everybody understand this. This Bitcoin treasury company model will be the savior of the financial system and at that point everything will be understood. But on the journey the early advocates are at risk of being put into asylum hospitals in environments where this is not very well understood. So we are all on the Vostra channel trying to explain, understand, digest and give this information out. I hope that was useful. I hope you understood something. If you have any questions, comments, feedback, Vostra is here to learn with everyone. Ciao. Vostra signing
