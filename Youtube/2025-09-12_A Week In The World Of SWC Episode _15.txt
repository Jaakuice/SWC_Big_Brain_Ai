**James:**
(0:00:06) Welcome everyone. Uh glad you could all join us. Um it's been a week since I was talking to Jesse. Uh first of all, I just want to sort of cover off what's what's happened in that week. Um we had the latest update from the ATM on Monday, which I think was uh 2.6 million quid. And then later this week that was then uh converted into Bitcoin as we would expect. Um so all in all quite a quiet uh week on the um on the news front. Zinc, anything you want to say about those two? I mean sorry before I should should have asked the question second. Um, I mean it doesn't sound like much, 30 Bitcoin. Um, you know, based off some of our previous purchases, but at the same time, it was only 4 months ago that we were cheering on, you know, a two bitcoin purchase.

**Zincs:**
(0:01:11) Yeah, exactly. And I think you know the main thing especially during a month like this is that you just keep things ticking over you know in a period where clearly across not just in the UK but across you know the world that Bitcoin treasuries have been experiencing MNAV compression um sentiment has gone to the toilet. So, as long as we can keep buying Bitcoin and that we're not stagnant, that's all that matters to me at the moment. Um, you know, 30 Bitcoin, I think that's more than everyone else in the UK that bought uh that's uh put together in the last couple of weeks. So, um yeah, you know, in the next time around it's going to be a lot higher than that because we've had a couple high volume days. Um so yeah, as as long as we keep moving, I'm I'm very happy with that.

**James:**
(0:02:05) Yeah, for sure. And then um the other thing to sort of talk about, I suppose, based off recent trends and recent sentiment is uh you know, share price. Um yesterday, uh last Friday when I was talking to Jesse, uh I think we closed at 1.28. Um, and today we're trading, you know, ever so slightly above that, which makes it sound like it's been a quiet week. Um, what's your take on on the price action this week?

**Zincs:**
(0:02:41) Well, we we had the run up to 172. um you know there was a lot there was a huge influx of buying activity and then I think yesterday there was quite a big seller who sold like over a million pounds worth of shares. So um yeah it's good to just see the volume return more importantly I think yeah the trading volume returning is um the most important thing here.

**James:**
(0:03:10) Yeah, for sure. I think it's our third or fourth uh yesterday was our third uh fourth high high volume trading day um

**James:**
[03:25] compared to recent volumes. Um so that's encouraging. And what do you think about [03:30] the I don't know how into technical analysis you are but the kind of breakout from the downward trend line to [03:38] then retest it and then we see where we go or do you think it's more just uh [03:44] finding our consolidation level? Yeah. So I don't really do the technical [03:49] analysis stuff just because I think especially at this, you know, for small cap like [03:57] SWC, I don't think a lot of the traditional TA stuff is applicable [04:02] because it can all just be shifted by one big buyer and one big seller. Um, [04:08] but I do think we've definitely bottomed. I don't think we're going to close below the 1 [04:14] 3 p that we did before. I think we had that capitulation wick on the 2nd of [04:20] September and I do think that's the bottom. I'd be very very surprised if we go lower than that. Um, [04:26] so yeah, I just think it's just, you know, it's it's not just Smart Web, you know, Capital B, Meta Planet, MSTR, [04:36] it's it's the same thing. I think the bottom's in for all these companies. Um, and it's just a period of consolidation [04:43] before we make the next move up. We've seen Bitcoin, you know, starting to make [04:49] its move now. So hopefully that's a sign of things to come. [04:54] Sure. Um, you know, yeah, looking at the wider market, um, the big sell-offs seem

**Zincs:**
[05:01] to have have slowed or stopped for pretty much everyone. um [05:08] uh of of the sort of main contenders at least. Um [05:13] I guess that kind of segus nicely into maybe a bit more of a macro view, [05:19] Bitcoin, that kind of stuff. Where where's your head at with regards to that? We're going higher. Um absolutely. [05:27] I think we're going to get I think Morgan Stanley just come out and said that they're expecting three rate [05:34] cuts this year. um you know inflation in the US came in [05:40] at a bit lower uh than predicted. So I think yeah we're going to get rate [05:45] cuts and that's going to be you know that's going to set fire to the match [05:51] tick and I'm expecting Bitcoin to have an explosive Q4 at least the run up to [05:57] 140 to 150K in my opinion. Um over the next couple of weeks we've got, you [06:04] know, some big Bitcoin buyers coming from, you know, Strive. They just [06:10] completed, they got permission to do their merger. You know, Meta Planet have $1.4 billion coming over the next week. [06:17] So, yeah, I think there's going to be a lot of capital coming into Bitcoin over the next couple of months. So, I'm I'm [06:24] very bullish. And where are you at with regards, you know, Jesse? Uh and Joe Bernett did that [06:32] uh podcast um this week, the Mustard Seed podcast

**James:**
[06:37] by Joe um on kind of four year cycle versus that's over grind up um kind of [06:46] thing. I'm I'm on that it's it's over. But like it's you know people have been [06:52] saying this cycle after cycle but I do think you know the macro environment is [06:57] completely different this time around. It's the first time that we've got Bitcoin ETFs. We've just seen the [07:02] Bitcoin treasuries accumulate over 1 million Bitcoin and they don't plan to sell. There's a lot less leverage in the [07:08] market. There's no FTX, etc. So, outside of a black swan, you know, I can't [07:15] really see why we should have such a draw down this time round. And I think the hing [07:21] is less impactful every four years. So before we had that, you know, uh after [07:29] each harveing we had that, you know, a high level of tightening of the the [07:35] supply, but now we're at 450 Bitcoin per day that's being mined, but that's being [07:41] eaten up, you know, by the ETF alone. And then you got the Bitcoin treasuries. So it does feel different. The type of [07:48] capital that is buying Bitcoin retail is almost irrelevant. So, you know, it's the first cycle [07:54] where, yeah, re retail are, you know, pushed to the side. These institutional investors, [08:00] you know, they're less price sensitive. So, I'd be happy with a slow grind up to be honest. Um, I'm hope I'm hopeful that [08:09] that's, you know, the case and that we don't have another prolonged,

**Zincs:**
[08:14] you know, draw down. And also I think it's important as well that this is the first time going into a bull market [08:20] where interest rates are so high. Since Bitcoin's inception, we've pretty much [08:25] had you know zero to less than 1% interest rates. Now it's the first time [08:32] that you know interest rates were you know got to 5%. So um and over the next [08:38] couple of years I expected to go down and I'm expecting quantitative easing to resume as well. So, it's hard to see, [08:47] you know, in the backdrop of the ETFs, the nation states, institutional investors, Bitcoin treasuries, you know, [08:54] where where's the selling going to come from and where's the prolonged bare market going to come from? I don't know. So, yeah, I'm I'm expecting [09:01] it to be prolonged. Yeah, I mean, I'm kind of on the fence. [09:06] I still lean towards the four-ear cycle until proven otherwise. Yeah, that makes sense. the the the [09:15] thing that um comes to my mind is things like global liquidity cycles um [09:22] presidential cycles which kind of tie into that um and uh the [09:30] oh what am I trying to say uh just simple human irrationality right [09:38] um if Bitcoin gets to a where it seems like it's overheated, [09:45] people are going to FOMO in which overheat it more and then just by [09:52] the nature of markets, it will correct. Yeah, it could easily

**James:**
[09:57] happen like that. Maybe we have the exact same repeat. But um [10:05] one second, one sec. One sec.

**Zincs:**
[10:15] I guess Zinc's got an important call. Um, okay. [10:22] Uh, what am I going to talk about? So, the rest of the session after we finish [10:27] on the macro, we're going to start talking about uh the potential mergers and acquisitions that um SWC might be [10:36] eyeing up. Uh you guys saw um this morning I expect the uh Financial Times [10:43] article that uh featured SWC and I won't go into the article cuz it's [10:51] well standard mainstream media. Sorry about that. That's okay. Um I've just been filling [10:58] time telling people what we're going to talk about. Okay. Where was we? Sorry. Sorry. [11:04] Well, I think we're just finishing up on four year cycles and um you know, [11:09] yes, there's a possibility it can go either way. Yeah, human psychology, you know, people [11:15] I think the power law, the Bitcoin power law followers are, you know, expecting Bitcoin to top at 200K and then, you [11:23] know, drop back down to just under 100K. So, there will definitely be people trading it and expecting it. So perhaps [11:29] towards the end of the year we're going to get you know um much greater level of volatility. But you know personally I [11:37] don't plan to sell anything. None of these Bitcoin treasury companies plan to sell. So I guess we'll just have to see. [11:44] Yeah I think I think just to sort of confirm that if we only hit say I don't know 130 140 maybe $150,000 [11:53] uh on Bitcoin that's not a blowoff top to me. No. Me neither. So,

**James:**
[11:58] and and and and so I don't think that would be enough to say, okay, we're going to correct 50 60 70%. Um, [12:07] but you know, it's Bitcoin. Yeah, anything can happen really. [12:13] So yeah, I was I was just saying to people while you you were taking that call, um [12:18] FT article this morning, um Andrew's mentioned in it obviously because it's [12:24] covering SWC, but uh as quoted as saying that he's got a potential merger or [12:30] acquisition uh in his sites um and he was talking specifically about [12:36] treasuries. Um, I then did a post after that this [12:41] morning sort of looking at at at two options in the UK cuz my mind first went [12:48] to UK cuz you know a whole bunch sprung up. Um, saturated market. It'd be good to kind [12:54] of clear out the dead wood. Um and [13:00] without diving into all the tiny, you know, we've got half a bitcoin uh treasuries, it seems like uh let's have [13:07] a look at coin and sats, right? So coin I just think is a non-starter. It's [13:13] not trading below uh below one nav. Agreed. Um so write that off. and then sats kind [13:22] of piqued my interest particularly with the RNS that came out this morning saying that their auditor had quit. Um [13:30] and you know I don't want this to turn into a like on sat session but

**Zincs:**
[13:37] um you know that that sent a signal to me that potentially and it's a big if um [13:45] their prospectus might be in trouble um or or as a business they might be in trouble [13:51] which means their 163 million pound raise that they did would all that money [13:57] or and well the and the bitcoin that was paid in kind would have to go back to the original investors. [14:03] What's what if and if SWC was able to do an [14:08] acquisition of them to save the deal and they could do it at a discount etc. What are your thoughts on that? [14:15] To be honest, I think it's quite unlikely just because of how complicated [14:21] their structure is, you know, with the CLNs that they have. It's all, you know, [14:28] there's so many fingers in the pie and there's so many people involved that I [14:34] just don't see it working with, you know, cuz there's a lot of people owed a [14:40] lot of things. Um, so yeah, I think it would be quite messy [14:47] personally, so I see it as quite unlikely. As you mentioned, there was the um [14:55] RNS of the resignation of the auditor. I think yeah the reasons that they gave [15:00] was that the working relationship had broke down. So [15:07] who knows what that that means and what you know but I I I don't think that I

**James:**
[15:12] you know with with just the amount of people involved I think if SWC was going to look at an uh an acquisition it would [15:22] be a prospect that's more attractive. Yeah, I mean, yeah, it was kind of in my [15:29] head it was, oh, there's 163 million up for grabs here. Um, and an LSC uplisting [15:36] opportunity. Although, you know, M&As take take a long time. So, maybe that [15:42] would actually slow down the uplifting process. You have to remember that 163 million [15:47] was pledged at uh a 1 mAV or just above. So it wouldn't [15:54] be a creative anyways to SWC. Yeah. Or yeah, it would only be if it was at a [16:00] discount. Um but yeah, I I take your point. So I don't want to answer for you, but [16:06] in my mind that kind of counts out it being a UK uh treasury. [16:13] H the on the Bitcoin Treasuries Net website they you can filter through by [16:19] MNAV and you can just look at all the companies and there is quite a few that are trading. I don't know if all the [16:25] data is complete but there is quite a few that are definitely trading below 1 MNAV [16:31] and you know I made a post on this but essentially for SWC if they can [16:40] you know trade their equity to acquire a company that is trading below 1 MNAV it [16:47] would be accretive for shareholders and you know the further the gap is between

**Zincs:**
[16:54] the so the higher the premium that SWC is trading at and the greater the discount you know the target acquisition [17:02] is the more creative it will be yeah for sure so okay let's get into how [17:09] might SWC fund uh an acquisition let's start with what what you suggested there [17:14] which is share issuance effectively will give you SWC shares for your company [17:21] absolutely and it it makes sense for both parties because firstly for SWC [17:28] it's essentially the best analogy that I can think of is pretend that £1 equals [17:34] $1 and SWC has a pound but for some reason they have this market where they [17:41] can trade it for 180 and this dollar that they're getting is worth you [17:48] know 0.8 80, you know, 80 cents to the dollar. So, it's trading their expensive [17:54] currency for a cheaper currency, but the real value of both these things are [17:59] pegged at one:1. So, I think that's how they would do it because it's the most accreative for SWC. We don't have a lot [18:07] of cash on hand. I don't really see any other options to fund it unless we [18:12] raised capital then bought the then bought the company but that would be less accreative than just [18:20] doing it the way that I said. Yeah, for sure. I mean [18:25] basically giving someone something that's a 1.8 8 mnav for something that's8 FNAV like you're getting far

**James:**
[18:33] superior accretion than just buying it with cash right um yeah and also if you [18:40] think about the benefits for the other side they get to trade if you're trading at 0.8 AM for example, my assumption is [18:48] that a the stock is not really that liquid, but b there's something going wrong there. So you get to trade into [18:55] and and in return get S SWC S SWC shares which is a far will have [19:01] far more liquidity. Maybe the bigger players will be able to have an exit at that point. So there is pros for the [19:08] other side too. Um, but sorry, I'm just thinking about this. [19:14] If you found, I don't know, a big investor like this, uh, previously mentioned big [19:22] American bank and they give you, I don't know, 100 million pounds. Um, [19:29] and in return, they get shares, you're already getting that.8 MNAV anyway, aren't you? Um, [19:37] you know, the 1.8 8 multiple um by issuing the shares, then you've got the [19:42] 100 million quid to go buy the company. I don't know. I'm just thinking off the top of my head. But that that that's 100 okay you can do [19:49] that but instead of you know spending that 100 million quid [19:54] you can give them your own equity at 1.8 [20:00] times nav whereas that 100 million quid can buy bitcoin right? Okay. Yeah. [20:06] Yeah. So, but instead you're giving them it's the MNAV premium that is makes the

**Zincs:**
[20:12] deal far more it's better. It's more accretive for NAV per share. Yeah. So, I guess what you're saying is [20:18] if we've got 100 million on the table to be given to us, we could do both. Yeah. I I I wouldn't I wouldn't use that [20:24] to then acquire another company. I would rather acquire the company with my MNAV premium [20:30] because then that's more accretive and then I'll just use that 100 million to just get more Bitcoin. Yeah, for sure. Okay, I'm with you and I [20:38] think I agree. Um, okay. So, let's uh I sent you a list of um companies [20:45] according to uh bitcoin treasuries.net that um are [20:51] trading below a 1m. Now, um [20:57] some of these companies don't have complete data. So again, I don't know how uh accurate the data is. Um but [21:06] let's just assume we're working with with okay data. Uh let me share the screen a sec. [21:13] You know, there's a Canadian company called uh Bitcoin Treasury Corp, which [21:18] yeah, they um I've got the [21:24] data. They're trading at like a they're run by Canadian bankers. They bought [21:29] Bitcoin, raised capital for Bitcoin, but they never we've not heard of them since. But they're trading at a fully [21:35] diluted MNAV of 0.78x. [21:41] That's a perfect example of something I'd look at and be like, "Okay, that looks quite tasty." And they have 770

**James:**
[21:49] Bitcoin. Um, was that in the list I sent you or is that a different one? Oh, that's just [21:56] one I just record off the top of my head because I know that the this was a company that [22:02] was trading below MNAV that I've looked at. Um, doesn't seem to be much activity, but it could be. This is just [22:08] a perfect example. Um, you know, if SWC was to give equity, [22:16] acquire this company, it would be highly accreative to shareholders. So the bigger the delta between the bigger the [22:22] discount, you know, obviously the better it is. Yeah. Okay, I'm going to share the screen. [22:30] Okay, cool. So some of these will will whiz through, I'm sure, because one, there's a lot of [22:36] them, and two, uh, they're going to be quite an easy no. Um now this one next [22:43] technology on the face of it looks quite interesting cuz it's got a.3 uh mnav. [22:49] Mhm. Um but one it's pretty massive. Um [22:56] well is it massive? If it's market cap is $21 million that there's potential that could could be pulled off, right? [23:03] But it's also in China. Yeah. So when it when this says that the [23:11] MNAV is 0.3 um I find that quite unlikely unless [23:16] obviously I don't know anything to do with their operating business and and what's going on but imagine that uh I [23:24] can imagine an M&A with a Chinese company is quite complicated. That's the

**Zincs:**
[23:29] thing as well, like when Andrew is looking at these deals, it has to make [23:34] sense after, you know, the admin, the lawyers, the bankers, [23:40] and it's not just about the Bitcoin. What's what's the business that they're buying as well? Like, is that is that [23:46] something that we want to be dealing with? Yeah. How much debt, for example? Yeah, exactly. So, I think we'll just [23:53] write that one off straight away. Next, next we got Kango. Again, it's a [23:58] China um based one 783 diluted MNAV. [24:04] That's too big for us. Too big. Yeah. Yeah. Next. Similar. Too big. But you [24:11] know, that would be very interesting. I mean, you get a NASDAQ listing with that. I mean, [24:17] well, exactly. Let's let's just talk a little bit about the two big because I don't know enough about M&As uh to to to [24:26] comment on this, but I've definitely seen companies in the past where like a 100 million pound company buys a 1 [24:33] billion pound company and I I never looked into it, but I remember at the time thinking like how does that [24:39] actually happen? So, what I guess what I'm saying is it's possible that I'm [24:44] likely. You know, it's hard with like like going Oh, I've lost you. [24:52] Sorry. Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. Your mic's changed. You gone a bit quieter. Oh, is it is it does it sound better or [25:00] Yeah, there's less background. Nice. Okay, so I think that's not better.

**James:**
[25:08] All right, we're having technical issues. One sec.

**Zincs:**
[25:25] Oh, this is going well. Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you fine. All right. Is that Is that okay if I talk like this? [25:32] Yeah. Just get this I've got this low like Oh, this is a disaster. [25:38] Oh. is Yeah, it's gone now. Oh, is it gone now? Is that okay? [25:44] Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So, um I think it just depends on, you know, the devil's in the [25:49] details. Uh it's hard without knowing the specifics. I'm I'm sure there's lots [25:55] of examples where it makes sense, but you know, if a deal was presented to [26:01] Andrew, you know, he just came back from Hong Kong, so maybe there were conversations had there um and some [26:09] interesting propositions were made, you know, if the company doesn't have [26:14] any debt, the MNAV is sufficiently below one. [26:19] Um, also I don't like on similar I don't think Andrew wants to buy a medical um [26:27] diagnostics company. I'm thinking it would be something smaller because I don't think you want [26:32] to give away a big chunk of your equity either. Like you don't want to have one [26:37] a massive dilution event like that in one go. Okay. As well. So let's let's move on from similar then. [26:45] The next is also a big one, but I thought it was interesting. Uh, Empire Digital used to be Vulcon Inc. Um, [26:56] now I saw an interesting video from their CEO the other day uh publicizing

**James:**
[27:02] their their less than one uh MNAV. Basically, it was a little bit like [27:07] begging for investors. Okay. But um I don't know. It's out there. [27:15] Yeah. Well, you see if that's the true figures and the MNAV fully diluted to [27:20] 0.73 that to me that's super attractive for any Bitcoin treasury that wants to, [27:27] you know, get Bitcoin at a discount. And I I know that other companies are [27:32] looking at M&As. I think Strive uh they they they plan to do things like [27:39] this as well. So, it' be interesting if Smart Web actually does this. [27:44] I mean, if they were the first to do it in the in the space, that would be uh [27:50] pretty telling, wouldn't it? Yeah. Yeah. It would be I'm I'm just [27:55] have to wait. He did say that he was looking I don't know how long these sort of deals would take as well. It probably take a while. [28:01] Yeah. Um so, and also Emperor has uh is a lossmaking [28:08] company by looks things. So, Oh, no. That's that's the loss on their Bitcoin [28:14] stack. Okay, let's move on from that one then. Uh sequence. [28:22] Yeah, I think they I think that's No, they they've got plans to uh they're not [28:28] going to go out like that. I don't think a it has to be a company that's

**Zincs:**
[28:33] dead in the water and that they they they don't want to continue doing this or they don't see a viable way. I don't [28:41] think the guys at Sequins, you know, Cory and Ben and are ready to throw in a [28:46] towel already. So, I don't think and also this is perhaps an example of [28:53] where the data may not be right. I don't I don't believe for a moment their diluted MNAV is 0.067. [29:00] No, if you go on their website, it's completely different. So, okay. Yeah, let's move on from that one. [29:07] Okay. This one kind of caught my eye actually. Fold. [29:12] Have you heard of Fold? Yeah, I've seen uh them on X. I haven't [29:19] really Yeah. Go on. So, they've got um I believe a a checking account in the US, [29:25] like a current account um that gives you Bitcoin back as a reward for for what [29:31] you spend on the debit card. Um but they are also releasing a credit [29:39] card um which I think will be popular in the States. [29:44] Don't know if it makes money, but I'm kind of assuming it does. Um [29:50] but but but the end map's only just sub one. You see the thing about this as well I [29:57] think I think there was a question from uh Dr. Bitcoin MD the thing about these [30:05] M&As is that if they have operating business does it take too much time and

**James:**
[30:10] uh effort away? So, I'm assuming any deal would involve, you know, us just [30:15] getting the Bitcoin and getting rid of whatever remnants is left of the [30:21] other company. So, I can't imagine, [30:27] you know, if this is a actual running business that is profitable, I can't really imagine that to be [30:33] honest. Or they've got a shedload of debt or something. Yeah, [30:39] let's let's crack on then because there still a few to get through and we might get to the ones that are a possibility. [30:47] Okay, so DDC. No, [30:52] they they they they want to I think they just released their goal. They want to get to like 1% of the Bitcoin supply or [30:59] something like that. Um I think these companies that are active [31:06] I I don't but maybe I honestly I have no idea. I don't know to be honest. I think [31:12] we might get surprised. Yeah. Yeah, I think in my mind that the trading at that where it starts to get [31:19] interesting level of MNAV um 74 74 [31:25] um their American could be useful. I don't know what [31:31] they're uh which stock exchange they're listed on. New York Stock Exchange says it there. [31:37] Oh yeah, on the right. Yeah, there we go. Um, you know, that could be a nice listing

**Zincs:**
[31:44] potentially. Um, from a from a strategic point of view, but [31:50] yeah, they're an active treasury. They may not be interested as in it's not in [31:56] their interest. Yeah. I [32:03] Yeah, I don't really have much to say about All right. [32:10] to be honest. I think it's just it could be any any one of these companies and and these numbers I don't trust I don't [32:16] I don't trust them. Okay, fair enough. I mean again these numbers [32:22] might be might be rubbish. Um but this one caught my eye not because [32:28] of the ridiculously low M love because in Hong Kong. Exactly. And where's Andrew just come [32:34] back from? Hong Kong. could be quite tasty. Another 833 [32:42] Bitcoin. I mean, if it is that MNAM figure is correct, then that's that would be quite [32:49] quite the accomplishment because in my head, I'm thinking if they're going to do these deals, and if [32:54] it is international especially, it needs to have enough juice in it for it to be worth it. So, I'm thinking at least the [33:01] sub0.8 mnav, they've got to have a decent amount of Bitcoin. So at least I don't know 250 Bitcoin for example. [33:09] Yeah. Cuz otherwise the costs are going to be like too high for the benefit. Right. Exactly. This this if these these [33:16] numbers are correct then you know why not 833 Bitcoin. And the other thing

**James:**
[33:23] that that struck me about if it was an Asia-based uh treasury [33:29] or Australasia maybe um would be the [33:35] additional ticker potential for near 24hour trading. [33:41] [Music] Yeah. Yeah. That that that's that's interesting [33:46] because it would make sense. So yeah, I I don't know. It just struck me as [33:55] that was interesting and a way for, you know, uh Asian [34:02] investors to to get easier access because I know it's quite difficult for them at the moment. [34:07] Yeah, absolutely. Contender. Contender. Okay. Ming Shing Group. [34:13] They've made they've made the contenders list. Uh, SOS Limited, [34:20] China. Um, their MBA's ridiculous. [34:25] Uh, probably not right. Yeah, but it is New York Stock Exchange [34:31] listed. Um, I don't know. Just seems a bit maybe [34:38] need needs a bit more research to to find out a bit more about it. [34:45] Bitcoin Treasury Core. This is the one I was talking about. Okay. [34:50] So, you already know stuff about this. They're saying it's at a 646.

**Zincs:**
[34:57] See, so those those numbers are slightly off. Uh the fully the fully diluted is at [35:04] 0.78. Basic Hemnav is at 0.65. But um the only [35:10] thing I'd say about these guys, they are run by like actual bankers. So I don't [35:16] know because how I see it is that for a company to be acquired that's almost a [35:22] team not giving up but they don't want to you know participate in this game any [35:28] longer. Um, I don't know if they're at that stage yet, but I don't know what what what [35:35] they plan to do to get their MNAV back about uh above one. It doesn't have any [35:40] operating business. It's it's a Bitcoin treasury, but [35:45] they've they they've set out that they want to do uh Bitcoin denominated loans. [35:53] Um, so they want to use the Bitcoin uh to generate money, right? [35:59] Yeah. So, [36:04] they're going to need a lot more Bitcoin than that. I would assume so. Um, [36:11] to be able to offer offer anything of size. Okay, that's definitely a contender, right? [36:17] Yeah, for sure. For sure. Where are they listed? Canada. [36:22] Okay. Toronto Stock Exchange, I think.

**James:**
[36:27] Okay. That's not necessarily advantageous in that sense, but but from a pure Bitcoin situation, you're not [36:35] really buying much else. Um because it's a treasury [36:42] that one day wants to do loans. So, yeah, that's different. That's [36:47] definitely interesting. Okay, CIMG. [36:54] What do we think to this? I haven't heard of them. They're Hong Kong again. [37:00] I have no clue. 834. I'm going to leave it on the maybe list [37:05] because it's Hong Kong. Anything in Hong Kong. Yeah, because all of a sudden it's just come up after Hong [37:12] Kong. For sure. For sure. We weren't talking about this before. No. So [37:18] um so could could have some legs. Okay. [37:24] 3u holding AG. So this is a German company. [37:29] I'm I'm doubtful on the MNAV um just because it's down at.3. But um [37:36] one to look into perhaps. Yeah. I I for some reason I got a [37:42] feeling it is going to be a company from Asia. Okay. just because [37:49] I don't know, they just come back from Hong Kong and I'm just thinking this this this just came literally after they [37:56] come back from Asia. So yeah, my head was was Asia or or you

**Zincs:**
[38:02] know, America or Canada just because there had been a lot of Americans and Canadians at the at the conference. Um [38:10] true. But yeah, uh [38:16] I'm going to look into it. I'm going to look into it. I'm not saying it's a strong contender, but I'm intrigued. [38:22] Okay. LM Funding America. [38:28] Don't know anything about them. NASDAQ listed, which could be useful. Um [38:34] it's saying a 0.5 MNAV, reasonably small uh BTC balance. [38:42] I think they're Bitcoin miners. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. [38:47] Probably not a business we want to get into. Definitely not. [38:54] Um it's pretty uh capital intensive, isn't [39:00] it? So, um a lot of the miners, [39:05] most of them trade at 1 M or below. What about [39:10] except for iron. What about a a company purchase that's done a bit more like a venture [39:16] capitalist where you just strip out the assets and shut everything else down? I'm assuming I'm assuming that's exactly [39:22] what um Smart Web would do if the company that they acquire has operating business [39:29] cuz I don't smarter web is not going to you know have a subsidiary subsidiary abroad and

**James:**
[39:37] is running businesses. I just don't think that's viable at all really. [39:43] What What about if it's profitable? [39:49] Well, then why is it trading at a 0.5 m? True. True. Um [39:55] yeah, I just I think that the profitable operating businesses come after the [40:01] monetiz.

**Zincs:**
[40:07] Um yeah. Okay. [40:12] Uh let's get rid of that one then. And the final one, Advanced Bitcoin Technologies. [40:19] Uh another German company. Yeah. but with a [40:26] ridiculous MNAV. If it's true, I mean, yeah, if that's that that's that [40:32] just doesn't look true to me at all. But if it was, of course, the thing is the lower the MNAV you can get for these [40:38] acquisitions, the better it's going to be. So, who knows what opportunities has come [40:45] and crossed Andrew's desk. I think a lot of people though they are [40:51] thinking about I think a lot of people have questions because typically M&As [40:56] require a lot of work a lot of capital a lot of you know admin [41:02] so people it has to be worth it otherwise you're going to have people complaining yeah I mean you've got auditors uh [41:09] lawyers the actual person capital cost of it taking up Jesse and Andrew's time [41:17] uh advisers, you know, all that kind of stuff. Exactly. The bankers. So, it has to be [41:24] something that that makes sense. Um it is interesting though, the FT article [41:29] and when Andrew posted it, he did mention he did mention it especially in [41:35] his tweet. Did you see? Let me get it up. So it does sound like something that he

**James:**
[41:41] was, you know, UK's bit biggest Bitcoin buyer eyes struggling rivals and Footsie [41:47] 100 birth. Oh, that is the title of the article to be fair. [41:53] Yeah. Okay, never mind. I think I think he's always looking for [42:01] options. It doesn't mean this is necessarily even going to happen. Um, [42:07] but I think it's interesting to see that as a result of this mini bare market [42:13] that we've been through, there are opportunities out there now. [42:19] Yeah. I think what this just represents is the flight to quality and that most [42:26] of these companies, we're not going to have, you know, 100 companies on the top Bitcoin 100 [42:33] corporate treasuries just being these sort of pure players where they're running the sale [42:40] of flywheel because you can't do that without the trading volume. You can't do that without an ATM. you know, if you [42:47] don't have a viable route, you know, to offering preferred or to at least tackle [42:52] the local fixed income market, you know, there's a strong ceiling as to [42:58] what you can really do here. Other, you know, what's the point of the uh market giving you a premium. So, a lot of the [43:05] names that we heard coming up, you know, in the last couple of months, we we may [43:10] never hear from them again in a serious way. Um, and all it's done is improved

**Zincs:**
[43:18] the relative strength of the premium Bitcoin treasuries. You know, especially [43:24] for example, smarter web in the UK. Before there was all talk about, you know, oh, number two, number three, but [43:30] now if you look across the the landscape, there's only really one company that's active at the moment [43:37] that's buying Bitcoin every other week. um that feels relevant, [43:43] that has, you know, a sufficient MNAV premium. So, I think there's probably going to be [43:50] a lot of opportunities going forward for the acquisitions of these smaller companies. [43:56] Yeah, for sure. And and if the four-year cycle thing occurs, then um even more [44:03] opportunities, I guess. Yeah, absolutely. Was there any other topics you wanted to cover, Zincs? [44:08] Because, uh, that's kind of what I had on the agenda. Um, not really. It's been a, it's been a [44:16] quiet couple of weeks in terms of, well, we we had the hiring of the, you know, [44:24] the new CFO and things like that. It appears to me that, you know, we're gearing up, [44:31] you know, to list on the London Stock Exchange. I've said before the end of November, that's my prediction. [44:37] Yeah. Um, so yeah, I think it just feels like things are working behind the scenes [44:44] that we're not privy to, but you know, Andrew, Smarter Web are just lining the [44:49] ducks up in order and that we may get a spur of activity, you know, in upcoming

**James:**
[44:55] weeks. Um, yes. I knew I feel like something's [45:00] cooking anyways. But aside from that, it's it's been a quiet couple of weeks. So, we haven't had really much to comment on aside from, you know, the [45:08] Bitcoin buys from the ATM. All I can say is that the community is as alive as [45:13] ever. I do, you know, appreciate that. Still growing. It's actually Yeah, it's [45:19] growing pretty, you know, pretty fast considering pretty pretty okay. Yeah, it's it's it's [45:25] it's actually fantastic to see lots of new contributors. Um, you know, I think we crossed 4,300 [45:34] and yeah, I think if we can do that now when sentiment has left the market, when [45:40] things pick up again, you know, you want to see SWC rebounding, you know, the strongest because it has that active [45:47] community. Um, yeah. So on that note, if if anyone [45:52] watching this wants to join, it's on X. You can just search uh the Smarter Web Company um and you it'll come up in the [45:59] in the groups uh communities that where there's also a Discord and Telegram channel um that that you can you can [46:07] join if that's your vibe. Also, if you could like or sub and [46:12] subscribe to the channel, that that would really help uh push these videos out to more people. [46:18] But on that note, I think I want to thank you Zincs, for joining and uh we'll be chatting online [46:24] in in minutes probably anyway. Yeah. No, absolutely. I appreciate everyone for tuning in. Sorry for the

**Zincs:**
[46:30] technical issues happens, but that's okay. Yeah. [46:35] Thanks everyone. See you all next week.
