**Adam Livingstone:**
(0:00:00) Good morning, my dearest little goblin captains. My name is Adam Livingston and I am the Bitcoin wizard. I want you to picture a humble British web design outfit that one day woke up one morning, looked at the pound and decided it trusted an orange cartoon coin more than the Bank of England. That outfit is the smarter web company. In just 4 months, it has mutated from a boutique WordPress sweat shop into a publicly traded Bitcoin Hoover that inhales fiat liquidity and exhales Satoshi dust. Dr. Cowboy Webbley and Professor Meyers have effectively stabled a turbocharger onto a balance sheet, then invited the entire Aquis market to shovel in the fuel. Every fresh share sold has acted like a sacrificial lamb funding yet another block of digital gold. And the ritual repeats while the crowd chants accretion like it's an incantation to summon ball. Today's briefing is not some polite investor relations fireside chat. It is an autopsy of traditional capital valuation performed while the patient is still twitching. You will hear how a company that once builds small businesses for SEO packages now treats Bitcoin as both treasury asset and spiritual compass. You will see how selling stock above the net asset value can feel less like dilution and more like alchemy. Turning paper claims into hardcapped money faster than a central banker can say transitory. You will notice that officer web no longer talks about earnings per share because earnings require customers and customers can be fickle. Whereas 21 million coins etched into cryptographic stone require nothing but electricity and existential conviction. Buckle in for metrics that are going to give Benjamin Graham's corpse a migraine. We're about to tour the mechanics of the premiumfunded coin stacking of Smarter Web Company. Convertible notes denominated in metric tons of optimism and a share count that grows like mold in a Louisiana basement yet still leaves holders fatter with Satoshi's per share. Forget quarterly revenue chatter. This is the Q3 update based on the gastric bypass surgery for Fiat obesity. The store of value is Bitcoin. The syringe is equity issuance and the dosage is calibrated monthly. And the only observable side effect so far is a share price that refuses to act like a mere claim on discounted cash flow. By the end, you will either dismiss this as a speculative fever dream, or you will wonder why every listed company is not already praying at the same digital altar. Either way, nobody leaves unchanged and nobody leaves with the same number of Satoshi's in their mental wallet. Let's begin. Oh yeah, public disclosure. I am a shareholder in Smarter Web Company. And on the last slide of the presentation, you will see why. Yes, I'm talking about price modeling. Get excited, folks. 

(0:02:55) Observe the beast in its current habitat. As of August 18th, 2025, the Smarter Web Company lounges upon 2395 BTC. Roughly the same amount of digital gold that entire nation states pretend they don't want, yet secretly Google every night. Those coins at today's spot park a tidy 280 million of Treasury net asset value on the balance sheet, which would be comforting if Smarter Web didn't keep turning NAV into a speedrun leaderboard. The equity side reads like a pharmarmacology label. 277.3 million diluted shares in circulation, each now trading at $2.36 each. Cheaper than a cup of corporate aroma coffee, yet backed by Satoshi's instead of burnt beans. For my friends across the pond, this is in US dollars. Sorry about that. Multiply the two and you hit a $655.3 million market cap. To traditional analysts, that's a school zone sign screaming premium. But to smarter web, that is an invitation to print more shares like carnival tickets and swap them for additional Bitcoin with the enthusiasm of a teenager buying Red Bull. Notice the ratio. market value sits at 2.33 times the underlying treasury. That multiplier is not a typo or a rounding error. It is a scarlet letter worn proudly by any company that tells investors, "Yes, we sell websites, but our true product is stacking sats faster than you can click refresh." Skeptics keep crying delution. Yeah, I know the noise right now, but your Bitcoin wizard daddy calls it capital velocity. I know there's a lot of noise right now with dilution from every treasury company. This is the factual matter, folks. Bitcoin accumulation is a zero sum game. There is a finite amount. You need to frontr run the frontr runners. You need to be tapping the dilution now. So, speaking of velocity, let's look at the purchase history. 

(0:04:51) On July 1st, holding stood at 773 BTC. By August 12th, they have sprinted to 2,395, a pace that would embarrass Formula 1 pit crews and sprint finish cyclists alike. The average purchase price so far is $111,280 per coin. Expensive perhaps, but the company's attitude is clear. If Bitcoin is destiny, paying retail now beats begging later. So, the bottom line, Smarter Web stands today as a publicly traded funnel pouring fiat from willing speculators straight into the hardest money ever invented while somehow leaving everyone with a bigger slice of that money per share. Traditional valuation metrics have left the chat clutching their pearls. The only metric that matters today is conviction, and on that scale, management is effectively running a nuclear reactor. Welcome to the new normal where web design revenues are quaint side quests and the main story line is industrial scale coin stacking. 

(0:05:52) Now we enter the forbidden mathematics of Bitcoin treasury alchemy. P over BYD. Thank you Sergeant Jesse. If price to earnings is the cardiganwearing accountant of valuation ratios, PBYD is the greased up cage fighter who skipped the manner seminar. The translation in plain English, P over BYYD, asks one brutal question. How many periods does it take for a company's relentless coin hoovering to vaporize the market premium that you just paid? The numerator is familiar. It's today's share price swollen by all theium and macro hysteria you can cram into a ticker. The denominator is where things get spicy. The Bitcoin yield delivered. the percentage jump in Bitcoin per share the company has coughed up over a given slice of time. Imagine you bought into a gold mine except the miners get paid in rock and every rock they dig somehow makes your fractional ownership heavier. That is BYD. The bigger the BYD, the faster the premium combust like a vape pen left in a sauna. Our formula turns that bonfire into a very clear countdown. So, this is the sorcery written out. We're not going to get into details, folks. But, in other words, you drop the markets overenthusiastic multiple into a natural log wood chipper. And then you just see how long it takes before the machine jams. When BYD is microscopic, the clock drags on like a government project. When BYD spikes, say after a month of equity for Bitcoin binge drinking, the denominator balloons, the quotient shrinks, and suddenly the premium looks as substantial as a politician's promise. You ask, Adam, why does this matter? Because traditional value investors hyperventilate at dilution. But in a BYD world, dilution can be weaponized. Each freshly minted share snaps up more hardcapped money, raising Bitcoin per share and detonating the premium you were once nervous about. If you keep this framework tattooed on your frontal cortex for the rest of the deck, every capital raise, every BTC purchase, every line of investor relations spin. If you filter it through the BYD, you will know whether you're watching a disciplined accretion or a poorly disguised Ponzi scheme. Spoiler. Smarter web thinks it invented the former and wants the market to fear the latter. Let's see if the math keeps backing up that swagger. 

(0:08:20) Welcome to the speed trap portion of the program. We just dropped the P over BYD formula on the previous slide. Now, let's shove Smarter Web through the radar gun and watch the numbers light up like Vegas. Let's talk about the quarter. Q3 to date, July 1st, the company sat on 773 BTC and roughly 269 12 million diluted shares. Fast forward 6 weeks and it's lounging on 2395 BTC with 277.2 million diluted shares. That's a growth spurt of 1621 coins. Crunch those inputs and the quartertoate Bitcoin yield delivered rockets to about 201%. Yes. 201% Bitcoin yield delivered in what? 6 weeks. Yeah, that's absolute money, folks. Translation: each share now commands triple the Satoshi's it held on July 1st. And nobody at HQ broke a sweat except the printer that spits new share certificates. Now, I don't want to downplay your hard work, Mr. Meyers and Mr. Webbley. You're doing a phenomenal job. If you feed that Bitcoin yield deliver into the P over BYD wood chipper with an MNAV parked at 2.3, treat the quarter as one slice of the pie of n= 4. And the countdown timer to vaporize today's premium pops up at roughly.19 years, which is about 70 days to earn back the current premium if that pace continued. Now, here's a fun fact. I actually did the math kind of incorrectly. Remember this is Q3 to date, but the formula is treating Q3 as a full quarter. So actually this result, this 70 days to earn back the premium is even better. In other words, if management keeps this coin stacking bender through Halloween, today's premium will have self- emilated before you finish the funiz candy. 

(0:10:12) So let's linger on what this means, folks. The shareholders are watching a live experiment where dilution does the impossible, makes every slice of equity heavier. It's like ordering pizza. The chef cuts more slices and somehow each slice gains pepperoni. Traditional finance textbooks burst into flames at page four of that story. Of course, this assumes Smarter Web maintains its current sprint pace without tripping over liquidity constraints, regulatory ninjas, or the occasional existential market panic. But for now, the conversion rate is surgical. Every 1% rise in share count is translating into more than 1% rise in Bitcoin per share. And that is the very definition of accretive nirvana. The bottom line, if you buy at today's premium, the math says the company can mathematically earn back that premium well before Halloween and well before New Year's. If they slow the pace, the timer stretches a little bit. If they crank it harder, the timer detonates sooner. Either way, the only thing more thrilling than this BYD velocity would be watching an SEC compliance officer trying to explain this on CNBC. 

(0:11:23) Welcome to the page where delilution transforms from a swear word into a cheat code. We are going to show how issuing equity at a 2.2x MNAF premium can make every existing share heavier in Bitcoin, a bit like discovering that eating cake somehow burns calories. Each dollar raised is magically worth $2.2 $2 in NAV terms because the market price bakes in that premium. They immediately ram those dollars into Bitcoin, shove the coins into the treasury. This is the thing you people need to wrap around your head, these people whining about dilution. The more that you dilute when your equity is trading at a premium, the more Bitcoin that you can buy, the more your Bitcoin per share goes up. You want more dilution. I've seen people model in 3% monthly dilution, 6%. You want a higher dilution. The ratio between pain and gain is not just linear. It is downright courteous. Traditional analysts at this point clutch their discounted cash flow models and sob softly. But earnings, they cry. Earnings are for organisms that require oxygen. Smarter web is a solar powered cryptographic cactus. It survives on Sunshine Premium Multiple and the tears of short sellers. This machine only breaks if MNAV drops below one. If the market can keep pricing shares above the nav, the company can in theory chop the share pie into infinitely thinner slices while somehow sprinkling extra satoshi's on every slice. This is the pizza parlor where the chef adds more plates each slice, grows more toppings, and the patrons cheerfully pay the bill. And here's the thing. Even if the MNAB goes below 1 one day, there's still the arbitrage of getting debt at near 0% to buy an asset that will go up 35% a year. Remember, equity issuance around the MNAV multiple is only one facet of the Bitcoin Treasury game. So, the takeaway for anyone tempted to scream dilution bad is simple. At premium multiples, dilution can be an act of generosity. It literally is. The cap table expands. The Bitcoin pile expands faster. And BPS, Bitcoin per share, the metric that actually matters when you worship scarcity, does a happy little moonwalk. Somewhere in Valhalla, the ghost of Gordon Gecko switched his rallying cry from greed is good to premium is divine. 

(0:13:50) So now it's time to dissect the smarter convert. A financial chimera that blends a Bitcoin loan, a convertible bond, and a Vegas parlay ticket. Picture Andrew Webbley wearing a lab coat, feeding equity, BTC, and options theory into a centrifuge, then handing investors a fluorescent vial. First, the structure. Smarter Web borrows $21 million principle measured in Bitcoin at the moment of funding. No interest coupon because charging interest feels too trady. Instead, holders get the right to flip that debt into shares at a 5% premium to the reference price, roughly $2.73. Now, the gamer cheat codes baked inside after 6 months if the share price sits 50% above the conversion price for 10 trading days straight. Professor Cowboy Master Webbley can slam the big red button marked force convert. then he can mint the shares and retire the debt. Shareholders get diluted, sure, but remember the premium math on the previous slides. The company just acquired Bitcoin with someone else's capital at terms that would make a payday lender blush. We love the Bitcoin denominated convertible bond, folks. Let's go. What if the price languishes in the crypto doldrums? Well, at month 12, Smarter Web repays 98% of the original principle, still indexed to Bitcoin's price. Lenders eat 2% as a thank you fee for playing. Given Bitcoin's historical mood swings, that haircut is basically the cost of a Netflix subscription compared to the upside if the shares rip. And I think they will, of course, that's why I'm an investor. Operationally, the convert is already counted in the diluted share tally, about 7.7 million shares. No hidden surprise egg. So why pursue this voodoo instead of plain equity? Three reasons. One, it telegraphs confidence borrowing in Bitcoin terms because management believes the coin will outrun the fiat anyway. Two, it lowers immediate delilution, giving the stock more room to levitate on narrative oxygen. Three, it hands the company a tactical nuke. If the valuation spikes, they pull conversion and lock in permanent accretion above market price. The bottom line, the smarter convert lets smarter web raise capital at a cost somewhere between cheap and practically negative, provided the share price behaves. If Bitcoin pumps, the lender wins. If the stock pumps, the shareholders win. If both pump, everyone wins except the poor souls. Still measuring value and price to earnings ratios. 

(0:16:31) So, behold the coin stacking timeline. On April 28th, Smarter Webb owned a laughable 2.3 BTC, about as threatening as a Chihuahua in a shark cage. By July 1st, that number ballooned to 773 1/2 BTC. The board must have asked, "How fast can we turn this thing into a mini micro strategy?" And they replied, "Hold my ASIC." The next 6 weeks literally just read like a Rocky for training montage. July 7th, the thousandcoin milestone. July 16th, 1,600 BTC. July 30th, 250 BTC. And August 12th, we're up to 2395 BTC. Jesse Meyers is telling the printer to cool its bearings before it bursts into flames. On a per share basis, the stack now weighs in at roughly 864 Satoshi's, which feels small until you remember there are only 2.1 quadrillion SATs in existence. The company's slice is large enough to make central bankers twitch whenever someone mentions hard caps. Now this is what I want to talk about. The pace check, the recent sprint clocked in at,58 bitcoin every 30 days. That is the kind of throughput you expect from national treasuries, not a web design firm with a mascot that resembles a Wix template. If they kept that velocity all year, they would vault past 10,000 coins before the next leap day. Here's the key takeaway for the audience. Smarter Web treats Bitcoin accumulation like oxygen. Equity is just the scuba tank. Every time they've been raising capital, they inhale deeper. And judging by this timeline, the tank is nowhere near empty. 

(0:18:10) Time for some fun, folks. Let's talk about some 4-month price modeling. I'm talking prices by end of year December 31st, 2025. Now, remember the previous 30-day pace of about,58 BTC. Now, I have three scenarios here. Slightly under that pace at 1,000 BTC every 30 days, slightly over at 1,200 BTC every 30 days, and a bit more aggressive at 1500 BTC every 30 days. Now, on the return torque matrix, we have varying MNAV multiples of slightly under the current multiple of a 2.2x at a 1.8 at around right now of a 2.2 and above a right now of a 3.0 if we see some MNAV going back up. And then on top of that, I have modeled in different Bitcoin price scenarios from 125K to 135K to 155K. Now, here's kind of what I'm seeing immediately, folks. If we want the share price to, you know, go up about 4x the stock's around a 230 right now, we want to see an $8 stock price, don't we, folks? I see two scenarios that happen relatively easily in the next 4 months that I think lead us to a 240 plus% return. If the MNAV goes up to a three, they continue to accumulate at 1,200 BTC every 30 days and Bitcoin only ends up at 155,000 by year end. That's getting you an $85 stock price for a 241% gain. if they're able to stack at a slightly higher pace of 1,500 BTC every 30 days. Bitcoin goes up to 155K and the MNAV is at a three, you're still getting a 273% return in $8.81 stock price. If you're getting in now and you want to double your investment and you don't think the MNAV is necessarily going to move a whole lot, that scenario would be a 104% return from a 135k BTC price at 1,500 BTC every 30 days. To me, that's incredibly realistic. Coin really hardly goes up based on this bull run that we're in. They stack slightly higher and the multiple remains the same. You still double your investment from today. Or maybe another scenario, maybe they stack 1,000 Bitcoin every 30 days. The MNAV is at a 2.2x, stays constant, you know, it doesn't go up or down, and Bitcoin goes up to 155K. That gets you a plus 106% return, a share price of $4.87. Now, obviously, we can do some moon math. Maybe we get higher multiples. You know, we've seen crazy MNAV fluctuation in competitors like MetaPlanet. Hell, we've seen it in Smarter Web itself. So really what these scenarios are just illustrating this is literally just the waiting game. Let BTC do the compounding. Let them stack the Bitcoin and time is on your side. You just got to wait. That's what it is. You're paying a premium for the futures Bitcoin. Now be patient and wait. 

(0:21:01) Feel free to take a screenshot, hit pause, look at what you could get under these various valuation scenarios. This is my thesis. You just got to wait. You know, I'm an investor in this company. I love their execution. They're phenomenal. It's time to be patient. Could I go back to investing in the S&P 500? Absolutely not. I'm stuck with Smarter Web. Thank you so much for watching everybody. My name is Adam Livingston. I am the Bitcoin Wizard, your number one source for Bitcoin and Bitcoin Treasury company analysis.
