**VOSTRA:**
(0:00:01) The Smarter Web Company, PLC. We are tracking the share price here, everybody. The share price is tanking. The MNAVs are compressing. It's a marketwide situation. Let's go across to the close of share price today. Two pound and the bid closed at two pound on the uh 29th of July. Remember yesterday we had the announcement of the 19.7 million proceeds from the ATM that was pulled forward. The market sentiment and the MNAVs continue to compress today. Let's take a look at the charts. SWC first.

**VOSTRA:**
[00:46] You can see that the two pound level is [00:49] being protected. [00:51] Does it go lower than the two pound? The [00:53] support here at the 0786. We've we've [00:57] been there for the past few days, past [00:59] week. [01:00] It does not want to go below there. It [01:03] has on a few occasions. It got to 1.70 [01:08] few days ago. [01:10] That was the lowest we have seen it [01:11] trade for a while. Two pound at the [01:14] moment. The bid is at two pound USA [01:17] chart. Let's take a look as of timing of [01:19] recording. [01:21] Showing me a price of $2.72.

**VOSTRA:**
[01:25] It is a marketwide [01:27] downturn. [01:29] Let's look at MetaPlanet quickly. [01:32] 789 on this chart. You can see that [01:36] that's come down to the support level [01:39] that it previously been around for the [01:42] past few days. [01:45] AltBG, [01:46] it's broken through there 0786. [01:51] There is a MSTR 393. Look at that. [01:58] This is not S SWC specific. We can see [02:02] we can see that very clearly. So this [02:05] times like this is where your conviction [02:07] comes in. Do you understand what you've [02:09] invested in? Do you believe in Bitcoin?

**VOSTRA:**
[02:12] Because if you do, then that's all [02:14] you've got to remember because that's [02:15] the power here. These companies are all [02:17] powered by Bitcoin and we know which way [02:20] Bitcoin is going. So with that, it's all [02:23] about timing, right? Model update. [02:28] So where does that leave us on the [02:30] MNAVs? [02:32] That is trading at an MNAB of around [02:34] 2.87 at that closed price 2. [02:39] Let's take a quick look now at the Smart [02:41] Web Investor community comments. zincs. [02:47] Just a reminder that the market is [02:49] experiencing MNAV compression. Yep, just [02:51] seen that. That's confirmed. Everything

**VOSTRA:**
[02:54] is down. [02:56] This is it. This is the thing. You can't [02:59] have green without the red. But you also [03:02] you can't have red without the green. [03:04] It's the way the world works. This is a [03:07] volatile industry. It's a new industry. [03:10] People are trying to understand the [03:12] metrics. People are trying to understand [03:14] how the valuations work. [03:18] We know we break it all down here. If [03:21] anybody's got any questions, put them in [03:23] the comments. Let's take a look at what [03:25] else X is saying. Of course, everyone is [03:27] the sentiment is a bit negative. That's [03:30] expected. Flying the British flag.

**VOSTRA:**
[03:32] Andrew in Hong Kong soon. Is anyone [03:35] going? Put your comments down. Are we [03:37] okay? We're okay. We know which way it's [03:38] going longterm. Giving up drinking. [03:41] Scottish mick there. 6 to2 pound 10 [03:45] funnyus. [03:46] Yeah, hang in there. Treasuries that [03:48] control their narrative, their time, [03:50] their raises and deliver creative growth [03:52] consistently will eventually see MNAV [03:55] expansion. It has to be. There is no [03:58] other way. [04:02] Some good discussion earlier with Jamie [04:05] on the ATM and how to make that even [04:08] smarter. Take a look at that. What do

**VOSTRA:**
[04:10] you think? Do we need to evolve the ATM [04:14] to take advantage of [04:16] trading prices to accrete even more? [04:19] Yeah. Any every time there's negative [04:22] price action, it's a it's a different [04:25] world. Moving across some comments from [04:28] YouTube that you've left. Thank you very [04:30] much. Paul Cotm says, "Discounts all [04:33] about confidence in your product." [04:35] That's right. The business does not want [04:37] to go below the 295. Can this be turned [04:40] around? Man 69 says, [04:44] "Thanks as usual, Vostra. Really [04:47] appreciate it. You said about making [04:48] available the share price model. I'd

**VOSTRA:**
[04:50] love that if ever possible and not too [04:52] difficult. Thanks again." Yeah, sure. [04:54] That was the um price prediction model [04:56] that we did. We can uh I can share that [04:58] link. Rory Cooney says, "Just an [05:01] excellent interview. Really enjoyed. [05:03] Great report. Looking forward to you [05:04] interviewing more people in the space." [05:06] Yeah, I have reached out to a few more [05:08] people. This is to do with the Ragna [05:10] interview. If you have not checked that [05:11] out, that's a brilliant interview we did [05:14] there with Ragnar. Ragnar is a retail [05:16] investor building a portfolio from 10 [05:18] million to 100 million. He's more

**VOSTRA:**
[05:21] insightful than his Viking profile pick [05:23] might suggest. Yeah, take a look. Cheers [05:25] for your comment, Kluff Reviews. As a [05:27] smaller retail investor, I really [05:29] appreciate these updates. They give me a [05:31] warm feeling. Thanks, Kluff Reviews. We [05:34] try and break it down in this on this [05:35] channel. The the game is fairly simple. [05:39] Share price is equal to the Bitcoin per [05:41] share times the MNAV. Those are the main [05:44] variables [05:46] and u you can see in an environment like [05:48] this, the MNAV is being smashed. So that [05:51] has a negative impact on the share [05:53] price. We just got to wait for the

**VOSTRA:**
[05:55] market to turn around. There's nothing [05:57] nothing major to be said on that. David [06:01] TK says Shard is the dodgiest broker in [06:04] all of the UK. I wish SWC wouldn't deal [06:07] with them. Has anyone had experience? [06:09] I've not had experience with dealing [06:11] with any of these people. So maybe leave [06:13] a comment. We'll see what that happens. [06:16] Grant Male 4112 says, "If we see another [06:19] ATM in the next 10 days, won't this [06:21] knock the share price back down towards [06:24] the 170? [06:26] Won't this knock the share price?" So [06:28] yeah, as we just said, Grant, the um [06:33] the share price, right,

**VOSTRA:**
[06:36] very quickly, the share price, [06:40] the share price is equal to the bitcoins [06:44] per share times the mnav. [06:49] Okay, so [06:52] really when you look at this equation, [06:54] your question there was what the ATM [06:57] smash the share price down. [07:00] I wouldn't say so. Everything is related [07:03] to these things and in particular the [07:05] MNAV because what the ATM enables you to [07:09] do is print more shares and raise more [07:13] cash so that effectively your Bitcoin [07:15] per share goes up. And um that's what [07:19] the game is here really. You have to be [07:21] printing cash to make your Bitcoin per

**VOSTRA:**
[07:24] share number go up because that's the [07:27] that's the main game. And what makes the [07:30] share price move is the MNAV. It's the [07:34] movement in the MNAV that is impacting [07:36] the share price. With a constant MNAV, [07:40] you can see that if you increase your [07:42] bitcoins per share, then that share [07:45] price has to go up. There is no other [07:47] way. It's a mathematical equation. [07:50] So, I get what you're thinking. You're [07:53] thinking the ATM selling shares, [07:55] diluting us out, and um smashing the [07:59] share price down. Yes, of course, [08:00] there's there's an impact on selling [08:03] shares in the short term, but this is

**VOSTRA:**
[08:05] the long-term game, and the big biggest [08:07] impact is the MNAV. So, I wouldn't worry [08:11] about ATM printing that I would worry if [08:13] the ATM wasn't printing. [08:17] Go back to anything else. Good. That's [08:19] all. I hope that answers your question. [08:21] Leave your comments. This is the market. [08:23] This is where you get tested. This is [08:26] Vostra signing out.
