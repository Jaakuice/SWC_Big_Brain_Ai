**James:**
(0:00:00) [Intro] Jesse, thank you for so much for for joining us. Um, really appreciate you taking the time to to come on and uh and talk us through the the the latest things and then have a bit of a Q&A.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:00:12) Yeah, happy to be here.

**James:**
(0:00:17) Great. Uh, so I I thought just start with the kind of major announcements this week. um 225 bitcoin added to the treasury. Uh just shy of the the next target at 250 uh bitcoin in the treasury. Um you know what's that uh addition that's like a 12% addition this week. Um good question. I don't know that math actually roughly. Um so you know still stacking still stacking. Um and the other the kind of main bit of news was um the change to the ATM. So yeah, I kind of want to uh go into the ATM a bit more today. Um because it's all the news and stuff that's come out MSTR with their new rule set last night. Um, and you know, people are hypothesizing on how it could evolve and change and and and lots of people kind of don't necessarily know how it actually works at the moment. So,

**Jesse Myers:**
[01:33] can we dive straight into like how the ATM works at the moment like the rule set? Um, [01:39] yes. Yeah. Okay. So the the way it works is [01:47] and and obviously this is you know executed by Shard um uh the the [01:55] affiliate of tennis in there. Um but the way it works is the price from a [02:01] from uh the price is set from close price on the aquis market the prior day. [02:08] Um and so that becomes the threshold where uh shard can't sell any shares [02:14] above or below that price threshold and that's applicable to all three markets [02:20] right so so Aquis USOTC and the Frankfurt market as well obviously [02:27] converted into the local currency but but that's the price threshold [02:33] um below which they can't sell any shares on on those markets they they sell shares There's uh [02:40] additional fun fact here, they sell shares directly into each market, all all three markets. Um and the rules are [02:49] really simple um the way it's structured uh and and and this was the [02:55] collaboration of of Andrew and and uh and Shard um to come up with this very [03:01] elegant structure here. they can sell up to 20% [03:07] uh of the volume for the day. Um and and and that's it, right? So that that

**James:**
[03:13] that's the extent of the rules to keep it nice and simple. So you can't sell below the close price um from the prior [03:20] day and it can sell into all three markets and the cumulative volume can't [03:26] be more than 20% of of total volume globally for that day. [03:30] MSTR Update [03:32] Thank you. Um hopefully that clears up for people how it how it currently works. Um [03:39] MSTR last night they released uh an update or or kind of a explanation of [03:47] how they intend to use the ATM on the common stock. um you know not below a [03:52] 2.5 m nav and then sort of in in graded [03:57] graded amounts of use up to a 4 m nav and anything above a four they're just going to hammer it by the sounds. Um my [04:05] word my words um um what do you think of that? Do you [04:10] think that's something that that uh SWC could could move towards? [04:16] Yeah, I I was sending Andrew some messages about this um as soon as that [04:21] came out. Um we haven't had a chance yet today, you know, because of the time difference. I was up for that and he [04:27] wasn't up yet um to to sync up on that. But you um MetPlanet has sort of [04:32] introduced a a similar idea. Uh I believe their threshold is 3xmnav that they either unofficially or officially

**Jesse Myers:**
[04:40] uh don't sell below that threshold. Um, basically I think it's I think it's kind [04:46] of common sense and and this is sort of being cry crystallized into policies. Um, strategy setting those kind of bands [04:55] uh is is interesting. Um, it's perhaps more prescriptive than than we want or [05:01] need or at this point in time. I I think because we're young, it's it's still [05:07] very a very good idea for us to remain flexible. Um, and you know, the reality [05:12] is like we've had massive mnav compression, uh, [05:19] you know, below what I think is, you know, um, where we should be. Um, I I [05:25] think, you know, we've gotten to a territory where based on the amount of Bitcoin yield we are we've been able to [05:32] deliver over any time frame, um, it's kind of a screaming value. [05:39] Um, so you know, if this ends up being kind of the low end of of where MNAV is for, [05:46] you know, for the foreseeable future, aka if if we, you know, if this is kind of like the the bottom of of our MNAV [05:53] compression crash, right? um then we'll we would expand from here and then you [05:58] know where we're currently at is still in the the range of of what strategy um [06:04] you know uh says is is is fair game. Um, [06:10] and and I think because of our size and the the amount of Bitcoin yield we're

**James:**
[06:15] able to deliver, we we should be I think um over that 4x threshold like most of [06:23] the time uh for the foreseeable future. I I would I would think, you know, maybe I'm wrong. Um but uh but you know, [06:31] that's the math that I see. So, um, yeah, and and I think it's a good idea [06:37] as you mature as a Bitcoin treasury company to start to signal that you're, [06:44] you know, what your accreative range is. you know, MetaPlan's been doing this for [06:49] at least a quarter. They're if you go through their um uh their presentations [06:55] from from May, I think um they have like a they have a great slide that shows [07:00] their MNAV over, you know, their entire history and then a window that says like [07:05] this is where we, you know, intend to be accreatively deluding people. Um which [07:12] has like a you know, a bottom end at 3x. Uh, and you know, I think we're I think [07:18] that's kind of the mental model that that I have and that we should have of, you know, over time that window probably [07:25] drifts down as MNAVs compress, as you scale. But, you know, think of it as a [07:30] window where like, you know, if we're if we're above, you know, strategies kind of put out [07:37] this number of 2.5, like if you're above 2.5, it's incredibly attractive. [07:42] Um, and especially if you're over 4x and I think we'll probably be over 4x for a,

**Jesse Myers:**
[07:49] you know, more often than not over the next year. Um, maybe it ends up being [07:54] something different than that. So, don't count on that. But I I think that's kind of what what we've seen from MetaPlanet [08:02] and and if we continue to remain on the same sort of trajectory, that's how it would probably shake out. [08:08] ATM Update [08:10] Yeah. And you you mentioned in that um about remaining flexible and and we'll [08:15] go back now to the announcement that came out on on Monday um about the first [08:20] change to the ATM um with regard to the [08:25] funds being released etc. Can you explain how it was working and now what what it's going to change to? [08:32] Yeah. Um, so we we had we had established that we were going to uh sell through a a [08:39] defined amount of shares before then updating the market on on here's what [08:46] happened. Um, Andrew came up with a a a an improvement in part by from hearing the [08:53] community's, you know, desire for um more frequent [08:58] um updates on that and and I think more frequent uh you know, receiving pounds [09:05] from that um to to have it be a set two weeks. So, we're going to pull up, take [09:12] stock of what's been sold over a two-eek period through the ATM and then report that to the market. And in doing so, we

**James:**
[09:18] can then collect those pounds. Um, rather than having to wait, we had been [09:23] we had the the first round of it was 7 million shares and and we were going to wait until, you know, however however [09:31] long that took and then report to the market. Part of it was um the way that [09:37] first clip shook out. Uh there was a tiny [09:44] amount um that that hung over into the next day. And so then we had to sell that and [09:52] then and then report on that at the end of the day. So there was like it was [09:59] suboptimal how it how it kind of it kind of made us lose half a day of ATM [10:05] selling basically. So this way it's a lot cleaner I think more predictable. Uh [10:12] I think it takes care of that you know hangovers of a prescribed set number of [10:17] shares into you know how many days is that going to be? Um, and so yeah, I [10:23] think it's I think Andrew came up with a really good solution here. And I think it's also important to, you know, let [10:28] the community know we'll we'll be iterating like and we're we're listening to you guys very intently. Um, if you [10:36] have ideas, you know, collectively if there particularly if there's consensus around ideas, you know, we we we get a lot of [10:44] ideas, but you know, we have to filter out a lot of them too. Um, if there's [10:50] consensus emerging around an idea, we're particularly open to to thinking about

**Jesse Myers:**
[10:56] it. And we're going to be iterating on, you know, ATM structure. ATM style [11:02] instrument structure. It's not an ATM. It is ATM style instrument. [11:07] Um, we're going to be iterating. We're going to be trying new things and trying to [11:13] optimize how we're doing everything. So, you know, expect that, you know, we will [11:18] continue to make little changes here and there u as we try to improve everything. [11:25] MetaPlanet [11:26] Okay, let's move on to some of the Q&A stuff that's come up um from the [11:32] community. Um, I think you may have answered this on uh Ander's uh show on [11:38] Wednesday, but I think you know for maybe people who haven't watched it yet or or [11:43] um maybe people just want to hear it again. Um [11:48] preferred stock becomes pertinent again today with MetaPlanet just announcing [11:53] that um you know they've launched their preferred. I haven't even gotten to read that today [12:00] so I'm looking forward to that. Um, I've I've known that's been coming. Uh, it's [12:07] been obvious, right, through the hints that they've been providing in the market. Um, and you know, occasionally [12:13] I'll I'll exchange texts with with Dylan and he would just hint around it, too. I

**James:**
[12:18] was like, uhuh. Okay. Um, yeah. So, it's really cool that that's happening. [12:25] I think it's very interesting how you know strategy you know came up [12:32] with this not that long ago like seven months ago now um maybe eight uh you know then when [12:39] they launched strike and then now they've rolled out four or five of them um so it's a fastmoving space uh and and [12:48] I think right when these came out the assumption was well you can you only [12:54] strategy can do this like you have to be in strategy's position in terms of balance sheet and sheer scale for this [13:00] to make sense but MetaPlanet started sniffing around it quite quickly and I [13:05] think they realized you know it it makes sense earlier too um you don't [13:12] necessarily need to have 600,000 Bitcoin um but you do need to have quite a bit [13:19] of Bitcoin and I think that's important for smarter web uh investors to know and [13:27] think about. Um you know, I think if you zoom out a bit to what's the value [13:32] proposition to potential investors in these instruments, you're you're saying, look, we have an incredible balance [13:38] sheet, extremely overcolateralized, and we would like to um [13:45] you know, issue debt effectively. Uh, and if you're interested in, you [13:52] know, getting 8 to 10% a year um for your fiat,

**Jesse Myers:**
[13:57] we will promise to pay that. And look at our incredible Bitcoin balance sheet. Like this is this is how you have [14:04] confidence that we will be able to do that. Um, [14:09] so you have to have that that balance sheet in order for uh the debt market to [14:14] be at all interested or or to you know to trust that to have sort of to deem [14:20] you creditw worthy right and you met Metaplanet's there I guess [14:27] and and we're on our way there but I don't think we're there yet. The other part of it too is like [14:34] the, you know, when you're young as a Bitcoin treasury company, when you're young and moving fast and delivering a [14:40] lot of Bitcoin yield and the MNAV reflects that, right? Like it it it should price in [14:47] that uh expectation of you how much yield can be delivered. Um that's the [14:53] market doing its magic. uh the you know if so long as your MNAV is [14:59] high the most valuable thing you can do is be issuing equity um the most accretive thing because you know really [15:06] anywhere over 3x is is incredible for um [15:11] the accretive issuance of new new equity um because [15:18] you're you're buying Bitcoin with it and you know the math on on a 5x mnav [15:25] that we have in our investor deck. Um, if you're at a 5x MNAV and you issue 10%

**James:**
[15:31] more equity uh and you use those proceeds to buy Bitcoin, that's um 36% [15:38] increase in Bitcoin per share uh just right there. So like 10% dilution, 36 [15:46] 36% net accretion from that. So it's it's ultimately and sailor's kind now [15:53] kind of nudging us to use the terminology it's just an accretive transaction. Um it's not a accretive [15:59] dilution. Yes there's dilution but then the accretiveness of it uh nets it out. [16:07] It's it's so great that it nets out to being just accretive. So it's an accretive transaction. Um when you're in [16:13] a high nav like that's the best thing to be doing as you mature mature as a Bitcoin treasury company. your MNAV will [16:20] compress and um then higher torque instruments become more important. [16:29] strategy has sort of faced that sort of ex existential question I think of like how do you how do you deliver Bitcoin [16:35] yield when your MNAV starts to get towards one um and and the solution is these [16:41] instruments preferred equities they they're the better form of debt fuel [16:47] debt debt market fuel um rather than just like you know issuing ordinary bonds or convertible [16:54] bonds um these are a better version of that so anyway All that to say, like [17:00] that's the that's the endgame. I think that's the the goal of where every [17:05] Bitcoin treasury company is trying to get to. But it's path dependent. You

**Jesse Myers:**
[17:11] have to get a a large clean balance sheet. [17:16] Before you're creditworthy enough for it to be interesting to potential, you [17:22] know, debt debt um investors. Uh and and yeah, and we're very much in [17:29] that stage of still building that balance sheet. And frankly, it's the more exciting part too of like we can [17:36] move faster and we can grow faster because we're small. Um and yeah, the [17:42] the I kind of have this mental model of like a two-stage rocket. You know, [17:48] there's for a Bitcoin treasury company going from zero from, you know, like like MetaPlanet, like Smarter Web, you [17:55] start on the launchpad. That first stage, [18:00] it it's equity. It's equity issuance, private placement, and ATM style [18:06] issuance. And then you get to a high enough point in terms of your your Bitcoin stack is [18:12] big enough that uh the the MNAV compresses naturally and you have to [18:19] switch to a different fuel source. You got your second stage rocket and that's going to be you know debt market capital [18:26] the bond market fixed income market. Um and preferred equities are the best [18:31] way to do that. So that's kind of like that's how I view things. That's how [18:37] Andrew views things. Um, that's where we're moving towards, but we're still very much in that we're still in the

**James:**
[18:43] early stages of that first stage of the rocket, which is a great place to be, [18:49] frankly. Thank you. And and you know, what size does the stack kind of need to be for [18:50] Size Matters [18:56] the people in the back that haven't heard this before? Yeah. So, so that's part of what's so cool about it is like we don't know, [19:01] right? like strategy was I don't know 500,000 Bitcoin before they launched [19:06] these but then now MetaPlanet what 17,000 Bitcoin they're launching them um [19:14] that you could probably do it with five or 10,000 Bitcoin. [19:20] I think you probably can't do it below that. Um and and yeah, you know, we'll [19:28] see. I think there's going to be and there are other factors too that that probably uh play into it like [19:36] first and foremost how clean is your balance sheet like if you have structural headwinds from you know [19:44] existing debt or strange covenants you know like like some of the some of the um Bitcoin [19:51] treasury companies that are popping up are trying to take some shortcuts to get to scale which you know is a risk and [19:58] maybe it works out for them or maybe it creates structural headwinds that they have trouble overcoming, you know, that [20:05] could quell their flywheel um or stop it from ever forming. [20:12] You can't have that, you know, if you're if you're trying to issue preferred equities without being at strategy

**Jesse Myers:**
[20:20] scale. So, you know, these other things play into it, too. Like, at what point [20:25] in time does it make sense to launch them? We don't know. I I think I think [20:31] it's it's very notable that MetaPlanet is able to do it at a much smaller scale [20:36] than strategy. Um, and basically that means we don't really know how small you [20:41] could be and have it work. But there's lots of other variables that go into it [20:47] too, like you know, how much demand will there be in that in your local jurisdiction for these products? The UK [20:53] happens to be pretty good on that front. I think there's a lot of demand for high yield [20:58] um because interest rates are are lower and um and and the way that retirement [21:04] accounts are set up, you're paying taxes uh unfavorably on on um some of these [21:12] things if if you're doing them internationally in particular. So anyway, there's a lot of things that go [21:18] into it. I don't think it's anytime soon. You know, I I think Andrew [21:24] has the um he's kind of put out the like his aspirational timeline. Um and and I [21:30] think uh the community should not expect that. Um certainly any sooner than that [21:37] and and probably not, you know, uh not as fast as Andrew [21:42] would like to do it too. Um, but I think like the more important thing is that

**James:**
[21:48] equity issuance right now is like is what we should be focusing on because it's the most valuable thing we can be [21:55] can be doing at this life cycle stage. And um yeah, so you know, we're we're [22:01] we're mindful that in parallel we have to build that out, but we're also also [22:06] mindful that like the best thing we can be doing is just executing on the equity issuance strategy right now. [22:13] Why are people selling [22:14] Thank you. Um, so the next question was kind of a bit [22:20] uh open. Um, and I'm not sure you can answer it. Uh, but I did notice that you [22:26] um you commented on a post from any B who I think is an S SWC investor but uh [22:35] mainly hails from Capital B community. Um, why are people selling? Um, [22:43] and I wanted to to sort of share the graphic that he shared [22:49] um that you commented on. I like this topic. I have a bunch of You can start talking. You start [22:55] talking. Yeah. Um, why are people selling? Um, well, that tends to happen with any [23:02] asset that has like a massive rally. Um, [23:08] oh yeah, this is a cool graphic. Um, you know, if you think about what [23:13] happened with with Bitcoin Treasury companies globally in, you know, over

**Jesse Myers:**
[23:19] the last three months, there was quite quite a a massive expansion as people got excited about, oh wow, there's going [23:25] to be potentially more meta planets um all over the world and and it could happen fast. Um, and [23:34] uh it got frothy, right? um it got ahead of fundamentals. [23:41] Um and and I think importantly some companies you know got the benefit of [23:46] the doubt when they had not yet proven their ability to execute on fundamentals. [23:53] Um and now and then of course you know when you have that kind of mini bubble [23:58] really the the tide ends up going out. Um, people who have made lots of [24:04] profits, they sell or, you know, they they they some some to some extent get a [24:10] little panicked trying to lock in some of those profits. Some people who bought the top, they panic thinking they made a [24:16] mistake, right? And they sell. And um um in Bitcoin world, we've seen this. [24:23] This is what happens with our four-year cycles. Uh, and so I'm like very familiar with the the sort of sentiment [24:30] and psychology that that I've been closely watching for, [24:35] you know, more than two cycles um in Bitcoin world and it and it's a dead ringer right now um for for how that [24:43] feels and what plays out. But yeah, you know, in Bitcoin coins change hands, [24:48] right? You you have panic selling, you have profit taking, you know, whatever

**James:**
[24:54] for whatever reason. um the individual market participants want to sell, they they end up selling [25:01] and being moved to to sell during a downturn. Uh and those coins in Bitcoin [25:08] end up finding new holders who have a forward expectation of their own about what [25:15] Bitcoin will do going forward. And they're starting their journey um and and they're expecting to hold for some [25:22] amount of time until who knows what happens. Um and so you know you you you reset the [25:30] holders. Uh and I think the same thing happens with any with any stock or any asset [25:37] that rapidly uh goes up. you you have a process that [25:42] plays out the same way of people too excited blowoff top gets a little little frothy [25:49] um and then there's a contraction and uh that contraction moves people to sell um [25:56] for a variety of reasons. shares change hands uh and they find their way to new [26:02] holders who are starting their journey with with their own individual thesis [26:08] thesis about what's going to happen where this thing is going to go. Um, and [26:14] they're not thinking about, oh, am I going to, you know, I I just made 100x. Is it all going to go away? They're [26:21] thinking, you know, I've taken a fresh look at at this the fundamentals here. I like the team. I'm going to I'm going to [26:28] invest uh and hold starting now. Right? So, that's like a just a very organic

**Jesse Myers:**
[26:33] natural process that plays out in markets. Um, and it's I you know, I [26:38] think what's been going on here, a few things here of Metaplanet's 15-month history. If you go [26:46] back and you look at their price chart along the way and their MNAV um expansion and contraction, they had like [26:52] four of these cycles in their 15month history. Um where MNAV expanded and then [26:59] and then contract and it kind of looked it always a little bit different, but it always looks kind of the same too of uh [27:00] MNAV expansion contraction [27:06] like a heartbeat on a on a chart, right? where where you've got this expansion, [27:11] contraction, and then and and then diminishing volatility as it kind of hones in on some consolidation level. [27:17] Meanwhile, they kept stacking Bitcoin. They kept adding Bitcoin per share and [27:22] then at some point that forces the consolidation to break out to the [27:28] upside. Uh that's been that's been the story with Metaplanet for its 15month [27:33] history. And and I think that's part that's such a big part of why I'm [27:38] extremely excited about what I'm seeing at Smarter Web. And and when this model [27:43] is done right, what what happens is that you know that nav per share, that [27:50] Bitcoin nav per share just keeps marching up and you can stay at a

**James:**
[27:55] consolidation level for quite some time, but so long as that that uh NAV per [28:02] share is increasing, like it at some point it forces the market to reassess [28:07] like wait a second, we're we're approaching the level where it's like one one with [28:14] Bitcoin and yet they're delivering a ton of Bitcoin yield. How do we value this [28:21] asset, this company? Uh and what we've seen with Metaplan is inevitably that [28:26] pressure breaks out to the upside and and starts a fresh cycle of price [28:32] discovery as the market tries to figure out what is the value of MetaPlanet [28:38] and and they you know break out to the upside in a big way and the same pattern [28:43] plays out over the next few months. So, you know, like if you go back and you look at the Bitcoin chart over 16 years [28:52] and, you know, every four-year cycle because of the having schedule, it ends up looking a lot like what we've seen in [28:58] the last couple months um with Smarter Web, just you know, on a a four-year [29:04] time scale with Bitcoin is kind of like a a fourmonth time scale um for [29:10] MetaPlanet. And it's kind of looking the same way with smarter web. Uh it's the [29:15] same mechanics and psychology playing out on a you know a 12x faster time [29:21] scale. And that's exactly what you want to see too, right? Like that isn't that's a a healthy digesting of um you

**Jesse Myers:**
[29:31] know a a big upside move uh as the fundamentals continue to improve under [29:36] the surface um and make it possible for [29:42] the next move. Um so anyway, you know, why are people selling? This is markets. [29:50] This is what h has to happen to digest um a a big upside move. [29:57] And it and it's also what makes it possible for everything to reset for [30:03] shares to end up with holders who have a you know who are looking ahead to the [30:09] future and thinking I'm going to hold this for some time or you know some [30:15] amount of performance um rather than looking backwards and saying like I need to lock in my gains right so so we've re [30:22] I think we're resetting you know investor expectations investor [30:28] um sentiment and metrics and uh and that's like that's all part of the the [30:34] process and then yeah so then just just taking a look at the fractal really of like what how Bitcoin's price discovery [30:41] plays out over time and how that how that manifests and then looking at [30:47] Metanet seeing well pretty much the same thing has happened on a 12x faster time scale [30:54] and then you look at at smarter web and and see we're we're in the first four months um of our life, but it's kind of [31:03] looking a lot like those two examples. Um and you know, the mechanics under the

**James:**
[31:09] surface are improving because Bitcoin per share has kept, you know, [31:15] increasing. So, you know, connect all those dots in your head and figure out [31:20] what you think. I mean, not financial advice, but buy the dip. [31:28] Um, okay. Thank you. Um, after an okay three months since IPO, [31:35] uh, what are your expectations for the company's performance and strategic direction over the next three months? [31:43] Analytics dashboard [31:43] Yeah. Um, obviously can't say anything specific. Um, [31:48] but what what I think is most, you know, I love going to the analytics dashboard [31:54] on our website and, you know, there's there's different things you can see in [32:00] in the in the six charts we have there. Um, one of those charts is Bitcoin held, [32:06] right? And if you just take a look at that chart, you'll see uh a [32:12] stairstepping up and to the right growing exponentially. [32:17] Um that's awesome. Uh and then if you scroll down, [32:22] there we go. On the right there, that Bitcoin held chart is very healthy. Um, [32:29] and and I think it's a it's a it's a it's the result of um everything that

**Jesse Myers:**
[32:37] Smarter Web does, everything that Andrew's built, everything that we're doing every week, all the conversations [32:42] we're having, all the infrastructure we're building out with, you know, individual um raising money through [32:49] individuals, through institutions, with the ATM style instrument. And that that all adds up to that chart. [32:57] And I think it it it is itself a a representation of [33:04] how Andrew runs the business, the cadence by which he executes [33:09] uh and and we all, you know, contribute to that. Um and and I think you can [33:16] you can make your own uh assumptions about whether or not that work ethic and [33:22] that approach to executing will continue. Right? So, you know, [33:28] each individual has to make that assumption for themsel. And then you scroll down to this MNAB chart. That's the other one I I think is most [33:35] instructive. Um because this will this will bounce around. This [33:41] is this is just a reflective of sentiment in my view for Bitcoin Treasury companies as an entire sector [33:48] um and also for the the particular um company in in question. But, you [33:54] know, right now we're at the lower end of of uh MNAV for our entire history. [34:01] Um, and you know, you can you can ask yourself, will we stay there or will we [34:08] not? Um and and you know the the contrast the the dip tick I guess of those two charts

**James:**
[34:15] I think is very helpful because one of them is going up and to the right and that's the fundamentals and then the [34:21] other one is market sentiment and is down and to the right at the moment. Um [34:27] and you can ask yourself if that'll if that'll remain. So I can't say anything about specific outlook for you know 3 [34:33] months or or whatever but but I think I but what I can say is you know take a look at our track record and ask [34:40] yourself what builds that track record and are those pieces still in place and [34:46] and the answer to that is yes very much so and we're adding to them. [34:53] Crypto ETNs [34:53] Okay. What are the biggest challenges facing SWC with regards to [34:58] regulatory/political dynamics in the UK? Um, and I don't know if you've seen this because it happened [35:05] like two hours before this, but um the FCA have officially okayed uh crypto [35:11] ETNs in the UK. Oh, good. Um yeah, I hadn't seen that. Um you know, [35:17] for for quite some time we we've felt that investors deserve that. Um, [35:24] investors deserve an instrument that tracks Bitcoin cleanly. Uh, and and and [35:30] that's great. Um, you know, our view is it's smarter web is is was never a [35:36] substitute for an ETN. Um, because it it doesn't track Bitcoin cleanly. There's

**Jesse Myers:**
[35:42] volatility that's layered on top of it as we've seen with the MNAV chart. Um [35:47] and and ultimately they're they're trying to do different things like an ETN is trying to give uh pure exposure [35:55] to investors, pure Bitcoin exposure uh to investor portfolios and what we're [36:01] trying to do is grow Bitcoin per share uh and that that's different, right? So our goal is compounding Bitcoin and [36:08] ETN's goal is straight up clean Bitcoin. Um so yeah, that's fantastic news. I I [36:15] think it's also a sign that you know between the lines we we think [36:21] that the success of smarter web may have may have influenced or perhaps slightly [36:26] accelerated that inevitable um you know regulatory shift was bound [36:34] to happen but um it's possible that smarter web helped [36:40] uh which is really cool if that's the case. Um, yeah, nothing more to say on [36:45] that. That's just that's good news for UK investors. Um, okay. Are you prepared for a bare [36:50] Raising Capital [36:54] market? You've mentioned the four-year cycle. Um, and do you think you can [36:59] continue to raise capital in one? Yeah. Um, [37:06] yeah, I think we're I mean, in some ways, there's no way to be ready

**James:**
[37:11] for a bare market, right? You don't know when it's going to hit or what it's going to look like or how long it'll last. Um, but [37:19] you can certainly be more ready than others. Uh, and I think we're in a fantastic position in terms of that. Um, [37:26] at the moment, we are 100% equity, right? And there is no debt on our [37:31] balance sheet at all. We're we're constantly evaluating, you know, adding [37:36] um you know, attractive debt, but it has to be very attractive for it to make sense. [37:43] Uh at the moment, we've got a incredible balance sheet. It's [37:49] 250 Bitcoin and no debt. Uh it's great. Um [37:56] and and that that makes us in, you know, puts us in stronger shape than than [38:01] other um Bitcoin treasury companies that have taken on debt. uh and especially [38:09] those that have more exotic financing structures that you know these there are [38:15] there there is an approach to financing Bitcoin treasury company that involves [38:20] giving discounts to institutional investors sometimes you know several [38:27] times discounts right like order of magnitude discounts in some cases [38:34] um and the problem with that is that those institutional investors are [38:39] immediately in profit and and are going to take profits probably. Um, and that

**Jesse Myers:**
[38:46] creates structural headwinds to, you know, getting the flywheel going. Uh, [38:51] and and that would probably be exacerbated in a bare market, right? Where if uh if you're an institutional [38:57] investor, you got like a 10x deal. Um, better take some profits, right? like if [39:03] things are moving down, you're you're going to be dumping uh and that you know that's just that's [39:10] just the incentive at play for that institution at that point in time. [39:15] uh we don't have that because we Andrew feels very strongly about having a [39:20] policy of no discounts for any investors even even me you know I I paid the the [39:27] market rate uh when I when I bought shares um and Andrew too you know uh [39:33] when when he buys when he buys shares which which side note I think is is [39:39] really cool like that's what you want to see by the way um if management is is [39:45] thinking, you know what, like in the investable landscape, the thing I'm most bullish about is the company I'm working [39:51] for. So, you know, when when Andrew uh looks behind the couch cushions and adds a few more shares here and there, it's a [39:57] it's a good it's a good sign. Um but anyway, you know, going into a bare [40:02] market, it's a it's about relative strength, I think. Um, and I think we've sort of seen that over the last month [40:08] too of uh this this MNAV contraction

**James:**
[40:13] uh has been really tough on on all Bitcoin treasury companies, but if you [40:19] look around, it's been tougher on some um and and those charts don't look like [40:25] they're, you know, shaping up with consolidation. some of them, you know, haven't found [40:33] they don't resemble a bottom at all. Um, and that, you know, may be part of the [40:40] story here, too, of like, you know, who are those sellers and are they still in profit and are they taking it and, you know, where is their at what point are [40:47] they no longer in profit? Um, so anyway, like you know, we're we're in a little mini bare market right [40:53] now for Bitcoin Treasury companies and Smarter Web is continuing to improve its [41:00] fundamentals during this bare market, right? like we're we're still in a high enough MNAV that it makes sense to just [41:07] keep doing what we're doing and we're uh you know raising funds through [41:13] private placement um our ABBS and also through the ATM style instrument [41:20] uh and we're emerging stronger um you know assuming this is this is a a mini [41:26] bear market and and things sentiment improves after this then we come out in [41:31] a in a position of of even you know looking relatively stronger than our you [41:40] know the the other alternatives um in the UK in particular and and [41:45] really globally like like it's about making sure that you're continuing to execute in a bare market and improve

**Jesse Myers:**
[41:52] fundamentals and we're doing that and others are are are not able to do that and I think that's that's uh quite [41:59] something that um that's notable. Um, in a bare market, you know, there there are [42:06] things we can in a bitcoin bare market if if we face like a 70% draw down or something like that. There are other [42:12] levers we can do, we can explore toi continue to deliver Bitcoin yield. I [42:18] mean, one thing you can do is sit on your hands. Um, you know, that's the minimum, [42:25] right? And we won't we won't end up doing that because we will find things that that make sense. um debt becomes [42:32] more attractive in you know if if Bitcoin's down 70% [42:38] um sort of uh paradoxically or or counter to what you'd expect [42:44] that's when debt becomes more attractive uh especially fiat debt at that point in time [42:50] and if you can get you know longdated if you can get like a fiveyear [42:56] uh ordinary bond structure in place that's actually the time at which it's [43:02] most attractive and most accreative to shareholders. Um, convertible debt would [43:08] also be attractive at that point in time. You in a bare market, if we're sitting on a treasury and trying to [43:14] figure out how to deliver yield, that's when uh covered calls or or naked puts the way that MetPanet does could help [43:21] generate income that allow you to to buy Bitcoin. Um and then you know strategy

**James:**
[43:26] put out a slide yesterday saying that like below 1xmnav [43:32] we would consider um you know buying our stock. [43:38] Uh and and that's interesting too. Um so there are things you can do. We haven't [43:44] had to get smart on them really. Um, and and I don't expect to have to get smart [43:49] on them. Uh, so long as the market is is [43:56] continuing to evaluate what's the value of smarter web when they're delivering this much Bitcoin yield. Uh, and and you [44:04] know that I think is our best ally, right? Continuing to execute at an aggressive pace. Um it it it makes it so [44:13] that buyers step in and I think we've seen that with Smarter Web in in over the last month. Buyers step in because [44:21] they start to think, "Wow, this is screaming value given the fundamentals [44:26] for this company around this MNAV, right? And and some of the other [44:31] companies haven't had those buyers stepping in because they don't have the same track record of of uh delivering [44:38] Bitcoin yield." So yeah, those are my thoughts around bare markets. [44:43] Key Man Risk [44:44] How big an issue is key man risk? Like what systems are in place? Yeah, I saw that comment, too. And it's [44:51] it's funny to me because um you know, I think uh that's part of why

**Jesse Myers:**
[44:58] I'm here. Um you know, like Andrew alone running a a Bitcoin [45:05] treasury company. Um yeah, there's key man risk there. Um, uh, I I'm I'm here to help Andrew. Uh, [45:12] I'm here to be to be his number two. Um, and and and I think that greatly reduces [45:19] key man risk right there. Uh, you know, I'm very much on the same page as Andrew [45:24] about how he's running his business. Uh, I love how he how he approaches all this [45:29] all these uh issues. And you know like what the community is not seeing is how [45:36] frequent frequently we're talking how much I'm learning from him about the business about how he approaches these [45:42] things you know like uh and and and culturally too like I'm I'm trying to [45:48] sponge up how best to run a business um [45:53] in the UK and you know learning from Andrew's values like uh you know I I think it's less [46:01] less of a norm in the US to care a ton about no discounts, but I but I've seen [46:08] now how important it is in a UK context. Um, Andrew's adherence to that, how much [46:14] importance he places on it resonates tremendously with UK investors and [46:19] that's a critical um pillar to Smarter Web's values. Um, [46:26] and and and I see that now. I think you also see um Bitcoin treasury companies

**James:**
[46:32] in the UK who aren't that aren't run by Brits um may make missteps with regard [46:40] to that cultural value because because it's not native to non-brits. Um anyway, [46:47] so you know, I'm I'm here to help. I'm here to be Andrew's number two. Uh and [46:52] and you know, I'm loving doing that. And I think that that right there um takes [46:59] care of a lot of the key man risk. Um yeah, and and you know, we'll continue [47:04] to build out the team as we scale. Uh and make sure that that you know, [47:11] keyman risk is mitigated. Again, something you may not have seen [47:15] Aquis Listing [47:17] because it came out today, and I'm not going to name names, but um there was a company that uh decided to down list [47:24] from the LSE to Acquis um in order to improve their odds at getting the [47:31] flywheel going. And I'm assuming it was down to not being able to issue shares very easily um and maybe costs. Um, [47:42] how would SWC potentially like overcome the [47:48] restrictions that come with LSC when you know in that future time when it might [47:53] happen? Yeah. Um, for the time being it's great being [47:59] listed on Aquis. Uh we like being listed there because

**Jesse Myers:**
[48:06] there are different rules around headroom uh and and it's a great place to be a [48:13] young Bitcoin treasury company. Um, in fact, you know, it's it's possible [48:21] that Cell AI, I don't even know how to say that, you know, their their company [48:26] name, but um they may have stumbled into one of the things that we uh viewed as a [48:33] bit of a competitive advantage um really of I think in the UK, if you're a young [48:40] Bitcoin treasury company, the best place for you to be is Aquis. [48:45] Uh, and it it our view is actually a disadvantage to be on LSSE when you're [48:52] still small. Um, and and it may be that they're [48:58] Why Aquis [48:58] learning that. Yeah. It comes back to it comes back to your, you know, phase one is issue [49:04] equity, right? Um, yeah. Yeah, that's right. And and of [49:09] course, you know, it's not a clean it's not like, you know, stage one booster [49:15] rockets, you want to be on Aquis and then stage two, you you want to be on LSC. Um it's not a clean thing like that [49:23] for for this topic. But um but I do think that [49:28] to get your flywheel going, to get to a certain size and scale, Aquis is the

**James:**
[49:34] best place. Uh, and and I think that it's been interesting to me that there's [49:40] been this race to, you know, people want to be on LLC from from the get-go in the [49:46] UK and and we've been quite happy to to let to be like, okay, good luck, good [49:52] luck everybody. Um, because because Aquis is has has been a [49:58] wonderful place for us at this life cycle stage as a Bitcoin treasury company. And importantly, you know, we [50:05] we think we will grow into a life cycle stage probably and not too far long from [50:12] now um where it it it may make sense to be somewhere else, but uh it's path [50:19] dependent, right? You have to get to that scale for it to make more sense to [50:25] be somewhere else. Um and the best place to get to scale is Aquis in my opinion [50:31] personally. And and I think that's kind of what we're that's based on what I've been seeing and learning about uh over [50:38] the last few months um studying this market. So yeah, you know, I'm I'm not [50:44] all that surprised that they're deciding to move. Um [50:50] and and and it also, you know, shouldn't surprise people if if other companies do [50:55] the reverse move when they are at a different life cycle stage than where Cell AI currently is with with just a a [51:03] few Bitcoin on their balance sheet. Um yeah and and in terms of you know what

**Jesse Myers:**
[51:10] are they running from or maybe running is a harsh word here but uh um headroom [51:17] it the restrictions on headroom on on issuing new equity are a lot more [51:22] stringent on LSE um 20% currently per year and and will be increased to 75%. [51:32] Um there are things you can do on top of that. Uh nothing is guaranteed on top of [51:39] that. Um but you can yeah and I actually will stop short of saying the things you [51:45] can do because we're we're exploring that and it's a deep it's a deep topic and uh um I also [51:54] don't want to you know give anybody any more information about what they can do. [52:01] Yeah, keep that IP to yourself. Um, okay. So, penultimate question. Um, [52:08] UK Capital Market [52:09] are SWC going to go after the European fixed income market? Uh, so not just the [52:16] UK at some point, but yeah. Um, we haven't talked about that. [52:22] Um, you know, I I I think that I think that our focus is on the UK capital market. [52:31] Um, my view personally is like that that there will be a a major winner in every [52:37] capital market. Um, and I have to drop in a few minutes unfortunately. Um, [52:43] and and the UK is a major capital market. uh and you know there's a a

**James:**
[52:50] significant portion of the world's wealth in the UK um and I think that's especially true in in the bond market uh [52:58] and so you know homec court advantage here uh matters a lot um being plugged [53:05] in especially when it comes to uh providing plugging into the the fixed [53:12] income market and and tailoring your products to the to the regulatory requirements [53:18] um that buyers on the other side of the table would look for and and need. Um so [53:25] that's going to be our focus at Bane. We like to say profit from the core. Our core market is the UK. Um it's where we [53:33] should be focused and that'll that'll that right there is enough to grow to 210,000 Bitcoin if we [53:42] just focus on on being the leading Bitcoin treasury company there. uh that's the scale of what's possible and [53:50] you know and I and I think will happen for whoever wins in the UK and we are we [53:56] want to be that winner. Uh and I think we're in position to keep executing to become that winner. [54:03] And the last one's just a bit of fun. Um what shampoo and conditioner do you use? [54:10] I saw that. You know, in the summer, in the summer, guys, it's it's all weird because I I swim uh a couple times a [54:16] week and so, you know, I get all chlorinated hair and and then I shampoo it and then it gets all like this. So, [54:24] so it's going to be all sorts of weird uh here in the summer months, but I I don't even know what it's called, the [54:30] shampoo and conditioner. Um, you know, my wife has that and I just uh I'm I'm

**Jesse Myers:**
[54:37] not a I'm not I'm not picking brands there. I'm just I'm just accepting. [54:44] Well, thank you very much for joining, Jesse. Really appreciate your time. Um hopefully see you again in, you know, a [54:49] few weeks time. Um let's let's do that. That'd be great. I I I like this forum for, you know, this [54:55] is where the uh the dieards are paying attention and getting their information and it's an awesome sign of a healthy [55:03] community. Um, and yeah, I like I like being able to to come and update people [55:08] on what's going on. So, let's do it again. Thanks very much. Take care, Jesse. All right. Cheers.
