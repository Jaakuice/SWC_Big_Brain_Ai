**Anders:**
(0:00:00) Good evening from Copenhagen. It is 5:00 p.m. in UK. It's Wednesday, so it's time for Smarter Webley Wednesdays. I'm lucky to have with me here today um Cre's uh Jesse Meyers, who's the new uh jockey with the faster horse in um in in UK investor and and jockey. Um how's it going, Jesse?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:00:19) And and uh I guess I'm more of like uh you know, I'm I'm I'm cleaning the cleaning the stalls at the end of the day. You know, Andrew's the jockey riding the horse, but but I'm helping out.

**Anders:**
(0:00:31) I think you you both have a um I I know you have a lot of um um influence there and I think he hired you after you offered some of your analysis. Uh shared it with him and he found it useful that happened in Bakers in an in an elevator and I remember you explaining on some um podcast. So, but but tell us um you you've been there for a little while now. what's what's going on and and um yeah, how does it feel?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:01:01) It it feels great. Um I'm you know I was thinking about it today that you know obviously for for any Bitcoiner the most exciting thing in the world is Bitcoin. Um because you know once you see it once you really understand what's going on here it's nothing in the world compares to what's happening with Bitcoin. But then the most exciting thing that's happening in Bitcoin is Bitcoin treasury companies because of what they mean for how capital will shift in the global asset landscape to Bitcoin. And then in the Bitcoin Treasury landscape, the most exciting thing that I think is going on is smarter web like like like by far because it's pretty incredible what Andrew's built, what Andrew's already put in place and it's pretty incredible the path that I see ahead of us. All we have to do is just keep executing. Um, and you know, this is following the same playbook that MetaPlanet has pioneered over the last 15 months of like how you grow from from nothing to being a a leading Bitcoin treasury company in in a particular capital market. And we are on that path and like and there's quite a clear there's no roadblocks ahead. We just have to keep doing what we're doing every week and keep that going and it's going to be very exciting. what what comes of it.

**Anders:**
(0:02:30) Yeah. Um could couldn't agree more. So um you're saying you find S SWC I mean obviously that's where you invested. That's where you're working like by far the most interesting like what what makes SWC more interesting than other fast growing um Bitcoin accumulating companies?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:02:47) Yeah, great uh great question. You know, I love that chart from uh Bitcoin B uh who kind of laid out like here's the rate of Bitcoin accumulation for various notable Bitcoin treasury companies from the time they started, you know, kind of lining up the time scales to from, you know, first Bitcoin buy. And the one that sticks out is is Smarter Web because it's just this rocket while the others are going up and to the right. Um, and and I think that contains a lot like that chart tells you a lot about the company, about about the culture too, about how Andrew runs the company. The man just executes. Um, I think it's like I think it's actually like a a mis or not well understood or sort of not articulated advantage that Smarter Web has that Andrew's been running this business for 15 years. And and think about what the business has been for 15 years. It's been 250 clients that need shit done and a small team that has to get shit done to serve those clients, right? And so that 15 years of that culture just like just getting solidified of get shit done and move fast because because we got a lot a lot to do in no time. Um so they're really efficient and Andrew's brought that same work ethic and mentality without even like unconsciously. It's just how he operates, right? Uh and he's brought that to how how do you accumulate Bitcoin? how do you execute as a Bitcoin treasury company? And I think that shows up in that chart of like the the pace is just faster. Um and and I think that the market is recognizing that that this is a a competitive advantage that Smarter Web has in the UK, but then also globally, like among other similarsized Bitcoin treasury companies, like who's going to deliver the most yield the fastest? Well, probably the company that's been executing faster than anybody else.

**Anders:**
(0:05:04) So, um I I think um well, what what I want to ask you so this this uh rocket ship growth and um I agree that graph is extremely interesting uh for both SWC and and H100. Um and you've been nicknamed the faster horse because of that, I think. And andrew's um execution and and I'm sure the whole team behind would do you think also there's some market conditions in UK that allows um SWC to to grow faster than by far most others.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:05:42) Yeah, I think it's, you know, when when strategy succeeded, you know, five years ago, starting starting this playbook, I think everybody assumed you had to be in the same kind of circumstances. You needed a cash cow business that was a certain scale in order to service your debts and and do this playbook. So, nobody tried it after, you know, it was unique. Um, and then MetaPlanet said, "You know what? we we can try this from a a failing hotel company, basically, you know, a company worth $10 million, a company worth nothing to and and it worked, right? Like that playbook worked in that context. Um, and yeah, and and so, you know, Smarter Web has has learned from those things and refined the the playbook a little bit further. Um, sorry I'm missing half of your question, but

**Anders:**
(0:06:43) Sure. Oh, I I don't did I don't know if it cut out, but I guess what me I I derailed myself. All good. Um, so what I'm uh what I'm thinking about is um this fast growth, this fast raise of money, does it have anything to do with um like James um from the local investor community? I had him on um about a month ago that that that there's that there's some um you know, money can't go anywhere else. If they want to go in Bitcoin, they kind of got to go into SWC.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:07:16) Yeah, that sorry that was the the leap I I I forgot my myself after I started on it. But so and you know, strategy was unique. Nobody could replicate it. Turns out actually you can replicate it and MetaPlanet has done that. And I think everybody kind of thinks MetPanet's unique. you can't replicate that because in in Japan they have you know certain preferential tax treatment for companies holding Bitcoin rather than as opposed to individuals holding Bitcoin and and that's a tailwind right um but actually there's tailwinds in other jurisdictions too and and the the big one in the UK is that uh retirement account money can't access Bitcoin currently so there's a lot of p there's you know one or two trillion pounds worth of of capital that can't access Bitcoin. Um and and along comes Smarter Web pioneering this model in in the UK and that's a big tailwind for for adoption there. Um, and I think is also part of um, Smarter Web having a lot of traction uh, and and like very authentic connection with the retail investor base in the UK because people have been looking for something like this and um, and they're pissed off that the FCA, the the SEC and in the UK um, hasn't allowed them to access Bitcoin with their retirement account money. So, you know, it's a very authentic fit. Um, analogous to how MetaPlanet is a very authentic fit for its own reasons. Uh, and and so I think it's, you know, it's it's kind of amazing actually if you think about the the UK and and Japan have a ton of similarities on paper if you zoom out enough, right? like island nations with a proud history and strong economy that have faced, you know, tough times in recent years economically. Um, and and both have had structural reasons why it's been hard to access Bitcoin. And so MetaPlanet success there was fueled in large part by those reasons. And I think that's what we're seeing, you know, as as one of the the big tailwinds that's helping uh smarter web in the UK for different reasons, but the same idea.

**Anders:**
(0:09:37) So, and and I'm I'm wondering like how long of a run runway does this advantage have of 1.2 trillion pounds, which is the only national currency worth more than the dollar in per unit, uh so to speak. Uh that that's a lot of dollars. It's a lot of pound. um how long will you know what's the size of um if if we take a a quick look at the at um your analytics page on the smarter web company uh page we see so the market cap is uh only half a billion um pound so there there's now obviously I'm not saying that that um that uh let me um total this away. I'm not saying of course it's going to go all the way to one one trillion, but but but there seems to be quite a runway there for

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:10:39) Yeah. So the the numbers there I mean if if we use 1.2 trillion um and and we're call it 600 million pounds. Um that's 0.05% of that amount, right? and like what what should your allocation be to Bitcoin, right? Like like that's for anybody to decide, but you know, for me it's a lot higher than that. That's for sure. Um and I think that's probably where the world is heading to an allocation much higher than 0.05% to Bitcoin. Of course, like I I think that Bitcoin ETFs, they're the equivalent in the UK. um will be happening uh and they should be happening that you know people in the UK deserve to have access to a product that like an ETF that that tracks Bitcoin cleanly and Smarter Web doesn't, you know, so it's not a it's not a substitute for an ETF. Um, obviously the focus for us is to grow Bitcoin per share and that comes with, you know, a whole layer of volatility on top of Bitcoin's price. Um, and and so, you know, investors deserve to have both, right? That access to both strategies. One, something that tracks Bitcoin cleanly, but then also something whose stated intent is to compound Bitcoin per share over time.

**Anders:**
(0:12:13) Yeah. Um and and and also what I I was just thinking of is if we look at again um your your website here at the analytics the the MNAV is right now you reported to like 3.19 and

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:12:29) Oh is it now? Wow. Yeah.

**Anders:**
(0:12:35) and and um so that means since you've accumulated roughly 2,000 Bitcoin, your market cap is around bit more than 6,000 Bitcoin. Let's say 6,400 Bitcoin or so or 6,500 Bitcoin. Um but but there's a long way up to that 1.2 trillion and obviously it won't take all of it. You you won't take half of it, probably not even a quarter, etc. But yeah, we Bitcoin is the best

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:12:59) % of that. It's a gigantic tailwind. Um um and let's talk about the the MNAV right now of like so we we put out a a Bitcoin buy announcement today um that puts us up to 2,450 Bitcoin that we're holding. Um and and I was you know running some numbers on this earlier and I put out a tweet about it, but uh you know our our 30-day Bitcoin yield um is 224% right now. Um and and that uh that is very interesting to me because um that means that if you bought and and you know the price wasn't this 30 days ago, but if you had bought at 3.24 two four Bitcoin MNAV 30 days ago. Today would be the day that you you know your investment would have grown into that premium that you paid 30 days ago, right? So, you know, delivering plus 224% in in Bitcoin per share in 30 days. Um, meanwhile, our current MNAV is now below that number, right? So, like that that to me is very interesting. Um, it's very compelling, I think, if you're an investor who who and this is a this is a high bar, right? You have to be an investor who understands Bitcoin, um, understands the math of of Bitcoin yield and compounding Bitcoin and is, you know, prepared to part with Bitcoin or or give up the opportunity cost of just holding Bitcoin in order to take on this risk of hopefully compounding that Bitcoin. But so that's that's that's asking a lot. Um, and there's not a ton of people at this moment in time who are equipped to understand that value proposition, that investment thesis, but I think it's a big opportunity for those who are.

**Anders:**
(0:15:00) Yeah, it's probably a none of what we're saying here is financial advice at best. It's financial entertainment. However, if you do like the entertainment, please like and subscribe, share with someone. Um but um so yeah, we've seen it across the board with someone like MetaPlanet. Uh they also have a a swing down right now in the channel of MNAP development. So it it seems to oscillate and there's there's a cycle. So it it could look like an opportune time, but this not financial advice and I I have made mistakes before. So let me let me say that. Um uh Jesse um preferred preferred stocks that uh strategy now is really hitting it out of the ballpark where they finally hit the one. Um there's a big demand for shortterm like basically 30 days parking of the money not losing not no swings in your um capital but just adjustments of the the interest rate. They have raised 2.4 billion 2.4 4 billion it is. Yeah. On that and and they they purchase 21,000 21 bitcoin based on that. Um is uh when is it possible when does it make sense? How many bitcoin do you need to have to launch preferred in the UK market?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:16:27) Yeah. Um a super interesting topic and kind of I I don't think there is an answer first of all. Um, I think obviously this is brand new stuff. Um, strategy only, you know, launched preferred like six months ago, right? Um, and obviously when they did it, they had a already a huge balance sheet of Bitcoin. Call it 500,000 Bitcoin. I'm not sure what it what it was. Um, and I think again the the sort of assumption was, oh, you have to be at strategies kind of scale to make it make sense. Um, but six months later here, we're already starting to see some serious, you know, hinting from Metaplanet that they're, you know, just around the corner to launching their own preferreds. And, you know, their balance sheet is, I guess, a little over 15,000 Bitcoin. Um, probably closer to 20 now, right? Um and and that kind of leaves you, you know, makes it an open question of how big of a balance sheet do you need to have in order for this to make sense. Uh and I think it the answer is it can vary, right? Like you just have to rightsize, you know, the the amount of preferred you're launching. Of course, these things have costs up front to to launch. So you can't, you know, you can't do it with 100 Bitcoin on your balance sheet. Um, but it's somewhere in the middle probably between a 100 Bitcoin and and 15,000 Bitcoin. And I don't know what the right answer is there. Um, it's obviously something we we think is the goal um or perhaps the end game of where you want to go as a Bitcoin treasury company. um with a leadership position in a capital market. We want to have a a healthy balance sheet and a strong track record such that you can launch preferred and um generate demand for them because you know if you think about the other side like nobody should be interested in um in handing over capital uh in for a fixed income kind of arrangement if it's a brand new Bitcoin treasury company that hasn't you developed any balance sheet or track record. So, you need to get to a certain level of of of comfort there of confidence for the other side of the of the deal to be interested. Um, and we'll see where that is and and you know that I basically I don't think it's I don't think it's uh any time in the immediate horizon, but I think it's the kind of thing that we would be hoping to at least pilot um when we get to, you know, maybe it's 5,000, maybe it's 10,000 Bitcoin, somewhere in that range, I think it's on very much on the table. And of course, you know, you need to anticipate when that point in time might be in the future and start work in advance of that to get ready for some, you know, opportunity like that. Um, so that, you know, we'll see. It's not something that's on the immediate horizon. Um and I and I think it's important to emphasize that to people um to investors, but it is very much something we want to be we want to do right uh and have it be successful uh and we think there's a path to eventually get there, right?

**Anders:**
(0:19:59) Um yeah, that that makes u perfect sense. It's a matter of time. The one thing I'm thinking of is it it seems that it it takes a lot of time at least in US of course each market is different for for someone like strategy to get a credit rating on their preferred stocks even though there's so much collateral behind. So it it seems that that seems to argue for like let's throw them out so they can go through whatever period of the local rating agency getting a a rating on it so there's an easier uh automatic automatic sale more or less um once they get that because then the the the big capital allocators will choose it because it's a good yield and it's you know yeah

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:20:46) I I would I think it's also like I think it's important to to call attention to like at at Smarter Web's current scale, life cycle stage, you know, however you want to think about it. Uh over the last 30 days, we just delivered plus 224% Bitcoin yield. Um that means that we're we're still at a small enough size that the best thing we can be doing is the pure equity play, right? like preferred start to make a lot more sense as your your MNAF really compresses because the market's starting to anticipate like for strategies how are you going to how are you going to stack another how are you going to double your Bitcoin stack like that gets you to a million 1.2 two uh million bitcoin. That's hard. So the mnav has to be kind of low because you know the just the physics of it. Um but we're at a at a scale still where you know met as metapanet has shown there's a lot of growth that we can achieve through pure equity issuance and I think that's the most accreative thing that we can be doing as a company right now is focusing on on that um path. Yeah. Um while keeping in mind that you know eventually you need to grow into the next life cycle stage you know further down the road which is is sort of transitioning into that preferred equities uh you know tapping into the bond market is what that really means like tapping into fixed income capital as as your primary fuel source in the future. But you know what MetPan has done with moving strike warrants for 15 months is just focus on that you know and and and they've done great and and you guys are doing phenomenal um at at the high speed.

**Anders:**
(0:22:41) So you you're talking about that it's a the best thing to do right now is is uh basically selling stock and and the preferred is is a little bit further down. Um less chararma hat and um what may be the next thing uh to think about for SWC like I I've seen some things on X that I think there was potentially an Easter egg somewhere and something from you guys. Obviously, you can't say anything that is not already out public and none is. Um, but what can you say? Is it is this when does this how big do you need to be for this to make sense? Is that something that could theoretically make sense from now on?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:23:18) 500 billion. Um, I I can say that we're we're not uh we're not spending our time planting Easter eggs. So, so if we can diffuse any uh any uh okay suspicion there, but um um you know I I think it's something that we're considering uh and and evaluating and it is theoretically doable um at at a at a scale much smaller than we currently are. Um you know, we're the largest company on Aquis by quite a bit. Uh and there are much smaller companies on London Stock Exchange. So that's that's about all I can say right there. And you know, obviously we are interested in being um listed in in the places that make the most sense for attracting the most capital.

**Anders:**
(0:24:16) Yeah, of course. Um it that's that's the name of the game, getting that capital. So one thing um I know you I know you have a 10-year plan. 10-year plan is a is a long time in um in this space. I have my own personal targets for what I believe is possible for different uh Bitcoin accumulating companies like you and MetaPlanet and and Strategy and I use that sort of when I allocate um my tiny investment funds towards you guys. Um what is does the 10-year plan you have say anything about your your Bitcoin goal of are you are you going for half a percent of all the Bitcoin 105,000 or what what what are you guys thinking?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:24:55) Yeah, in in our um investor deck uh which we put out on our website um if anybody's interested, you can you can go to the the investor um top right corner um button on our website and and and go find the presentations um section and and should be right there. Um yeah, in that I, you know, we included how we view it of our aspiration is to get to 1% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist. Um, you know, I think that is possible for every leading Bitcoin treasury company in a major capital market, right? And and how many of those are there in the world? Uh, I don't know. I guess that's maybe maybe that's half a dozen, maybe that's a dozen. Um and and and that's probably the extent of that list of like who can reach 1%. Um but I think that's possible for those companies. Um and so you know I think that that means I think that means MetaPlanet can reach that that scale. Um, I think it also means that the winner in the UK can reach that scale. And and I I think that Smarter Web has u certainly in my book the highest probability of being that winner in the UK. Um, just based on current position and and track record and everything that I'm seeing on the inside terms of how we're executing and running the business. Um, yeah. So yeah, that's that's I think what the scale of what's possible. And of course that comes back to like you know that chart I'm known for with the global asset landscape of like there's a lot of capital sitting in overpriced overvalued traditional equities. There's a lot of capital sitting in fixed income and they're both getting not great returns when you when you account for monetary inflation. And Bitcoin represents this, you know, much more attractive way to generate returns in the 21st century. And I think that there's going to be a migration of capital there. You know, inevitably osmotically, there's a natural migration towards Bitcoin. And I think Bitcoin treasury companies are the capital pumps that accelerate that osmotic flow from these capital buckets into Bitcoin. Um, and they'll do that in each of their capital markets where they have a, you know, a local domestic fit. um and are plugged into that that capital market scene. And so, you know, I think, you know, that's going to happen and it's just a question of who's the the the the leader who gets to that position in each capital market.

**Anders:**
(0:27:45) Yeah. And I'm going to have to agree with your assessment of SWC being the most likely winner in the UK market. I would say um everything points to that. uh the execution, current path, size, um you're knocking it all out out of the the ballpark. So that that seems very likely. I think that's not really up for debate at this point. Um so what else is is going on in uh in SWC that we don't know about that would be ex exciting um for the audience? It I mean I may we may have covered it all, but what

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:28:19) Yeah. No. Um I mean that's a fun question. It it's funny in in that sense that like you know we are in the business of increasing Bitcoin per share, right? Like that's our stated goal and so in a funny way like the the most exciting thing you can do is boring execution of of that compounding playbook, right? Like you want as much compounding as you can get. Um and that it generally look it should look boring like it should look like you know same old same old every every week or two the same announcements are happening again with with bigger scale and and the um the math continues to play out. So, I in a in a funny way, I think that's like it's hard to get excited about the same thing happening over and over again, but like that's really what you want in a in a compounding Bitcoin treasury company. Um I I will say that that I think you know we're I think maybe maybe the community um would be interested to know that like we're very cognizant that uh as a Bitcoin treasury company you go through life cycle stages that you know what makes sense for you your first 100 Bitcoin is different from you know the the next 10x and then and the 10x after that is a little different and the 10x after that is very different. Um and so we're very very aware of that and mindful of what makes the most sense and how do we consciously transition the strategy into what's most effective for the current um leg of the journey. So, you know, we're evaluating opportunities for different capital raising instruments. We're thinking about how do we shift the, you know, the the cadence of announcements, the approach to the ATM style um structure uh and and timing really um and and everything around the business too of like how do you grow into this next scale uh that you've now reached? Um, and and there's, you know, there's there's a lot of growing pains that have to happen in in a business that goes from 4 million pound market cap to to billions. Uh, and we're, you know, we're managing all those things and upgrading, you know, the internals in order with a mind, you know, with an eye to how do you get to that, you know, next 10x uh in scale. So, I think that's the exciting stuff that people aren't really seeing, but it's probably good for you investors to be aware that, you know, that we're thinking about it and we're very consciously uh trying to build the internal infrastructure necessary to get to the next level, right?

**Anders:**
(0:31:23) And um makes perfect sense. I just want to uh share again here what quote unquote uh boring looks like. If we look at the graph on the right, Bitcoin hell is um pretty exponential going uh upwards. So that is um but so you're right. Sometimes boring execution the same week after week. If it really works, keep doing it. If it's not broke, don't fix it. Um so so things are uh are looking um good there. explain to me a little bit if you can um how so how would you describe what you're doing now? Is is is that essentially like private placements or I know you have a subscription model and then going to the ATM. How would that change the what fundraising looks like? What will we notice anything in particular or what what we

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:32:25) Yeah, that's a that's a good topic. Um, and and I think it dubtales with what I was just saying of like, you know, when you when you're starting from nothing and you raise your first 10 million pounds, right? Like you can do that with just individuals, you can do that with retail. Um, that's pretty easy really. Uh, and then, you know, that's the start of your flywheel because you go from, you know, in Smarter Web's case, a 4 million pound company, you raise 10 million pounds and you plow that into Bitcoin. suddenly that that's that's a big change for the company. But you can do that with small investors with anything really. Um and and then when you reach a scale like we're at now uh that that mix of where you can you know source your capital from it does shift a bit of you know we're we're at a at a place where yes we you we still get um individuals high net worth individuals in particular who are interested uh in participating in our private placements. So we do you know equity issuance is private placement and also we have like a ATM style in instrument it um it's the equivalent of that um and and those run in parallel and uh and it's lumpy on in for both model you know both versions so the ATM is is running on every upday uh just generating capital and then and then we get that every two weeks uh is is the the go going forward plan there and then that can be deployed into Bitcoin and and the private placements are um whenever the the list of interested parties gets to a a point where it makes sense to do it. Uh and you know that that changes too of like um you know we're we're having more conversations with institutions now uh and the possible scale of you know the checks that they can write is quite large. Um you know you're talking about institutions that could say yeah I want to participate in the private placement and and purchase 30 million pounds of of equity. Um and that and that might even be a starter for some of these for some of these institutions. Uh and you know that's big meaningful lumpy. Uh I think what's what I'm really excited about and I've I've you know been excited about is uh the ATM style instrument coming online. um I think is the key to meaningful growth for the medium term. Um it like you know it's easy to get to 100 Bitcoin. It's harder it's harder to get to a thousand Bitcoin and then going from a thousand to 20,000 like MetaPlanet like how do how do you do that? I think the key to that is an ATM style instrument and that's because um it's it's based on a percentage of volume ultimately like you're selling into into the market directly. So you don't have to go find a bunch of high net worth individuals and institutions to you know write checks um every two weeks, right? like instead you're you're selling directly into the market and and you're raising proportionate to your market cap and and volume um in that every two weeks. So that allows you to keep scaling um you know like because we could we we hypothetically we could 10x um and then if you're just doing private placements now you have to raise 10x as much capital in order to keep moving the needle. But if you're if you're if you have an ATM running um then you just need the same volume to be traded in the market in order to raise 10x as much capital. Uh so I think that's the the super bullish part about having an ATM style instrument that is running well and and you know we're in a place now where we've we've had a couple cycles of it and it's working and that you know is very encouraging. So, you know, we raised about 20 million pounds um in 3 weeks of downtrend, right? Like that's that's the time period over which we were raising capital with the most recent um uh amount announced. Uh and you know, going forward, maybe we're not in a downtrend for 3 weeks. Uh may and maybe we generate that same kind of capital in two weeks. That's possible. We'll see. You know, nothing's certain here. Um, but if that happens, then 20 million pounds in two weeks, 40 million every month, that's 500 Bitcoin or so every month that we could be raising just from just from the current price level and the current volumes. Um, assuming kind of, you know, assuming you're not in a downtrend, assuming sort of half half uh up days and down days. But, um, that's kind of the baseline. I think of what you know what you you might reasonably uh you know if you did your back the envelope math what you might come up with as kind of a starting point. And of course, if if volume increases in in the market or if the share price increases, you end up raising more than 40 million a month and and potentially more than 500 bitcoin a month being added to uh the treasury. So that's uh you know the ATM is super exciting ATM style instrument. It is not an ATM. Um, that's super exciting and I and I think is the it's the key to growing like MetaPlanet has and and hopefully it pans out um, you know, similar sort of mechanics and um, volume growth and price growth as we continue to add Bitcoin over the coming months and then we might be following the same kind of path that MetaPlanet did, right?

**Anders:**
(0:39:04) Um so I have two questions for you now. Um first of all so you said you raised how much was it? 20 or 30 million during the downturn

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:39:15) 20 million pounds in in over the last three weeks of of downtrend. Yeah.

**Anders:**
(0:39:20) Uh so what is the motivation that brings the buyers uh to the market in the downtrend? So obviously, so I'm guessing these are not uh guys or girls that um that are spooked by the fact that the asset became cheaper.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:39:36) Yeah. So so to to clarify that that 19 million uh and more 19.7 or so um we raised so I called it 20 million but that that was from the ATM style instrument running during the downtrend. Okay. Yeah. Um, and then on top of that, we have our our private placements, our our accelerated book builds, ABS that we do. Um, and and like to be clear, um, there is more inbound demand during an uptrend than there is during a downtrend. So, you know, I think I think that everyone has sort of noticed this with the compression, MNAV compression across the entire Bitcoin treasury company landscape and especially in the UK um over the last month. Uh it's been harder for every Bitcoin treasury company to raise new capital. And I think part of what I'm excited about is that you can see that there are healthy Bitcoin treasury companies that have great fundamentals that are still raising capital and there are others that are seeing that you know capital raising grind to a halt really uh and or or they're failing to raise the the stated amount of capital that they intended to. Um, and I think that's very meaningful. Like I think that reading between the lines, we're going to keep having these shakeouts, the the volatility uh in the Bitcoin Treasury company landscape and the companies that keep their legs moving forward during these pretty violent um, you know, down swings which come with upside volatility. That's that's part of the game. the the companies that manage to keep moving forward and keep uh their fundamentals improving, meaning stacking Bitcoin, increasing Bitcoin per share. Um those are the ones that will come out stronger from, you know, from a winter really. These, you know, we've seen with MetaPlanet like in 15 months they had like four full cycles really um in terms of MNAV expansion and then compression. Um, and so it's just part of it's just part of these assets, uh, the the the price discovery, the monetization, uh, if you want to call it that, of of a Bitcoin treasury company. Um, and and I think it's super telling that, you know, if a company manages to keep moving forward during a winter, what it probably means about their ability to do well in the next, uh, you know, good time.

**Anders:**
(0:42:30) No, absolutely. So, uh, that made me think of another question. I have several lined up now, uh, Jesse, but I'll respect your time. Sorry. Sorry. Go for it.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:42:43) Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.

**Anders:**
(0:42:50) So, um say say another bare market hits, not not just a correction, but like a bare market in bit Bitcoin and we see MNAF potential MNAV corre uh compression on um fast growing Bitcoin accumulating companies. Let's say MNAV goes uh close to one. There are several companies like that are close to one in in in US and they're pretty stalled in their their the BDC yield. Um would uh is there anything else than preferred stock that can really help a Bitcoin accumulating company in a in a bare market low MNAV situation?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:43:34) Yeah, there, you know, luckily this is stuff I haven't had to pay much attention to yet. Uh, and and possibly never. We'll see. Um, there are things you can do in a, you know, if you if your MNAV gets to one or below one. Um, you know, the first thing you can do is sit on your hands, right? Like nobody wants to hear that, but it's it's a possible strategy, right? like if you're if you you know just want to wait it out, you can do that. Um and and think about like, okay, we're going to wait 6 months and then try to do things to get momentum going again. Um, barring that, you know, if you want to if you want to keep moving at all times, you can obviously you can sell you can sell uh puts, you can sell naked puts as as um MetaPlanet does. You can sell covered calls. you can sell a variety of derivatives to generate some income off of your Bitcoin treasury uh in order to buy more Bitcoin and and sort of, you know, generate a modest yield. Um, in a major Bitcoin bare market, funny enough, that's that's when things become most compelling to take on debt. Uh, you know, it it's probably the time when that sounds the scariest. uh you know because of the emotions that that happen during a um a bare market everything gets everything feels riskier then but that's objectively probably the best time to take on fiat debt in particular um there you know Bitcoin denominated convertible debt is I think attractive at pretty much any point um if if you structure it right because because the obligation um you know is protected on you know for a bare market the obligation shrinks um commensurate to bitcoin going down. So those are always kind of com compelling and then fiat debt also becomes more compelling um uh you know sort of contrary to what you you you feel is right at that point in time but um those are things you can do to take on debt to buy bitcoin to get the flywheel going again. Um, you can only really do that if you have a clean balance sheet going into a bare market. Um, you you want your leverage ratio to be under 30% certainly. Um, probably under 20% is better. Uh, and also probably depends on the life cycle stage of of the company. Um, so yeah, there are things you that you can do and there's probably quite a few that I'm not aware of or haven't had to explore. Um, there are things you can do in a low mnav scenario, but but I think that's part of what is important to avoid as a as a young Bitcoin treasury company is you want to, you know, I think what I think part of the magic, part of the the formula that MetPanet stumbled upon is that if you start small and get the flywheel going, you develop a track record of delivering Bitcoin yield. And the longer that track record uh gets, the more confidence the market has that you will continue to deliver Bitcoin yield. And that justifies a higher MNAV. It it and it protects you from people thinking that a, you know, a 1.2 MNAV is appropriate because, you know, like MetaPlanet, if if if the MNAV got down to 1.2, too. People would, you know, back up the truck to buy it because they have such a great great track record of of delivering Bitcoin yield. So, I think that it's it's existentially important. It's it's path dependent really to, you know, as a small Bitcoin treasury company, build as as robust of a track record as you can of like here's here's what we do every month, you know, here's how many buys we're we're executing every month. Here's how we raise capital every month. Um so that you can point to that uh and and and importantly the investor community can do run their own numbers and say holy shit this this company delivers and that justifies me stepping in to buy if the mnav gets under three right like and I I I kind of think that's what smarter web is benefiting from at this point in time like everything has contracted significantly. Um, MNAVs have compressed significantly, but I think that people are stepping into to buy value as they see it. you know, when Smarter Web's MNAV has gotten down to, you know, the the threes, which was where we're at right now, given how much, you know, given how we talked about, you know, if we if we do the same over the next 30 days that that we've done over the last 30 days, you'd you'd be, you know, you'd earn back your premium in 30 days, you know, if that if that continued. So, I think that that's part of like you don't want to get into a position where the investor base is is questioning like how much Bitcoin yield will they will they generate. Like we don't know, you know, you want to have a track record and you want to keep moving forward on that track record. Um, and you and that has to start from the beginning and it can't stop along the way. Um, so you you kind of you need to keep executing and maintain that confidence because because otherwise, you know, maybe your MNAV goes to one and then you're kind of stuck.

**Anders:**
(0:49:16) So, um, about that, I I have a a theory here and and, um, like humor me on this one and and let me know what you think. Um, first of all, it I considered it would be a gift. If MNAV goes below one, you can sell Bitcoin and buy stock. And unless you have said you're never selling, but technically and financially that would be very beneficial to shareholders to sell Bitcoin, buy stock because someone is willing to sell the stock cheaper than the Bitcoin backing them. So that's that's kind of a no-brainer, I would say, and I see that as a gift and that would keep the flaw around one. Now, um then I also see and I want to hear your opinion on that obviously um that the endgame mnath it it isn't one. Sure, it could be a compression from the three and the five and the 10. It isn't one. It's above one. Um I I'm I'm guessing I think it's conservative that it could be 1.5. So, let's say uh strategy um stacks 2 million Bitcoin and I think they'll be worth three million because they'll be worth 2 million just for what's on the balance sheet and they'll be worth probably another million. I'm just guessing here. Uh for the value of what that balance sheet can generate of income because it will be able to generate a lot of income. So if we say 1.5, maybe it's a bit maybe it's less, maybe it's more, but but but probably in the ballpark, um then if if your stock in a B or any other back stock in a bare market goes to MNF 1.1, I would as an investor think well this is now even if they completely stop you know running the engine now 1.1 is a premium to where it will end up being when we don't have fiat anymore and it's works as a bank or whatever. So, so it you know if if enough people understand that it's actually a discount say below 1.5 that would kind of make it you know they gravitate to 1.5 and even at 1.5 even though it's not super great uh in terms of how accreative the share issuance is um that that will still create a BDC yield. I mean strategy have been selling uh common stock at MNAP 1.8 eight. Right. So, so that to me that's my thinking the last few days is well these engines can't really stall. It will be very hard. Someone's making a mistake and foregoing an opportunity if they stole it shouldn't shouldn't be able to happen. But what what's your response to that?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:52:05) Yeah. Yeah. Um I I basically agree. I but I think that there are reasons why it could be driven below one. like, you know, you could I I think that a possible outcome for, you know, how Bitcoin treasury companies um as an emerging, you know, cohort um end up getting into trouble is some of them will take on too much debt or get into kind of nasty, you know, contracts. Um, if a bare market arrives for Bitcoin and enthusiasm, you know, washes out, people are running for the exit from these Bitcoin treasury companies trying to, you know, go back into Bitcoin or dollars. Um, and that would be a time when an opportunistic, you know, antagonistic hedge fund might attack a weak Bitcoin treasury company. one that one where they've been doing their diligence and seeing, wow, they've got, you know, a 40% leverage ratio. They've got, you know, all these warrants that, you know, that are attached to, you know, these convertible notes that they've done and and they're all coming due and there's going to be structural headwinds and we can short sell them and we can, you know, drive them into well below 1x MAV and then profit from it. So I think there there are scenarios like that where you know you have to protect against um getting into that kind of trouble on the on the front side right and and that's where being a in a leadership position in a capital market is really is is a big help um because you don't need to take shortcuts to try to catch up. You know you don't need to take too much risk to try to catch up. you can keep it clean um and keep a really really safe balance sheet which is you know part of what MetaPlanet has done. I also think that um you know on the other sort of related topic I think you're dead right that eventually uh MNAV is maybe 1.5 for strategy maybe it's more like maybe it's closer to 1.25 25. Um, I think that, you know, these these strategy, for example, will be able to lend out Bitcoin to big banks that are going to be good for it because they're backed by the US government. Um, and generate maybe 5% a year, maybe it's 3% a year, you know, on their Bitcoin, um, at least, right? and and then you know what's your willingness to pay for that kind of you know income um your discounted cash flow and Bitcoin terms you know for a a series of years where they're generating 5% every year yeah you're you're willing to pay you know 25 to 50% depending on on your time value of Bitcoin to you um for that for that you know to own that asset so that would that would suggest we will end up in that kind of end state for for the for the companies that reach the that leadership position and have the big enough, you know, big enough clean Bitcoin balance sheet that they're able to, you know, offer these preferreds and then be the kind of Bitcoin banks of that capital market basically. Um, yeah. So that's where I think this stuff is headed long term and I and that's where I think MNAVs will end up over one for the for those winners that you know succeed in each of their capital markets.

**Anders:**
(0:55:47) Would a market winner um if you would want to merge with a smaller Bitcoin accumulating company in in your market? Um, now if they're above M&F1, you could say it's like buying Bitcoin above par, which doesn't make sense. But if it happens as a, you know, stock issuance and like a a merger, we put the stocks together, so it doesn't really, you know, it's it's not pushing a lot of new stock into the market like you would do with the ATM. it would happen as a transaction where you um you know they get shares of of of the new company. Um would that make sense when let's say the other company trades at 1.5 MNAV and and let's say you trading at 5 MNAV would would that potentially make sense instead of just buying the Bitcoin because you

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:56:49) Yeah. Yeah. potentially. I think I think that's a a quite possible outcome for you know that the the the companies in each capital market that maybe they're late entrance, maybe they you know aren't run as well, who knows what, but they they end up uh not growing as much as the leader and then you know any bare market comes along um kind of shakes the you know the landscape and and valuations dip and MNAVs compress and and then it becomes pretty attractive for both sides, you know, to do a stockbased transaction where you're you're combining those balance sheets and if one of those is trading at a much lower MNAV than the other, it it can be attractive to both sides. Um, I don't know how those scenarios will actually look. Uh but I do think that I think it's an example of how we're being we're very much aware that in Bitcoin things can and will um you know the title go out at some point and uh we've seen it you know we've seen BlockFi and Celsius happen. We I I have the scars from 2018 with altcoins so I know what can happen. Um, and and I think that's part of it's part of what I'm inspired by uh MetaPlanet um with is, you know, they make quite a point of how low their leverage ratio is. You know, how little debt they have on their balance sheet. I think it's really really smart to do that because it signals strength. I mean, you're not only are you hard to attack, but it puts you in a great position if there's opportunities like what we just talked about um you know, in a bare market to opportunistically merge to you know, greatly increase your stack um in an attractive way.

**Anders:**
(0:58:55) Um, so you're saying convertible bonds is it's it's not it's obviously not something Wait, correct me if I'm wrong. SWC hasn't done convertible bonds yet. And right and and you believe that I think I think you said that early on in the in the life of a of a back then it may not be the ideal thing to do.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:59:26) Yeah. Um, you know, I think there's philosophical um, angles you could take here of like like you could argue both sides. Um, I I think that uh I think that MetaPlanet is just such a good model. Um, and you know, they've shown the power of of equity issuance and how accreative that can be if you're moving fast and you're small. um issuing Bitcoin denominated convertible notes is uh I think the most attractive um debt option out out there. Um which is sort of ironic because you know the you would think that it that fiat denominated debt would make the most sense because you're you know shrinking the purchasing power of the thing that you owe. Um but but you want to protect against that bare market scenario. So I think that it actually is you know the opposite. Um and you know right now we're focused on equity issuance because because we can you know generate quite a bit of accretion quite a bit of scale with that model right now. Um it takes a lot of time to do convertible notes. Uh you have to set up the structure of legal costs involved. Um and you you know there's a whole road show really of like trying to generate interest and get you know everybody to agree to terms and all it needs to be fair and on the same terms. Um so there there's a lot of process there and it can be attractive but I think that the thing to focus on um is is equity issuance. it it it may turn out that this is something we augment with, right? But I think the bread and butter um can and and and should be and I think will remain um ATM style issuance at at the life cycle stage we're currently at.

**Anders:**
(1:01:29) Nice. Um you know, uh Jesse, we're we're we're kind of up on time and I want to respect your time. Um, I don't recall I've done a show before where I'm sitting with more questions in the end. Still haven't asked than in the beginning. It was it was really interesting to hear you you talk and it it it spun a lot of things in in my head. But, um, I know we'll you you know, we'll have you back on and we'll we'll have this conversation again next Wednesday. Andrew will actually be here for a smarter Webly Wednesday. Um, but Jesse, you're coming back on. Um, and and you guys can find Jesse on uh you can see his handle on the screen at criesus_pdc. I don't know if I'm saying it right. That's why I called you Jesse.

**Jesse Myers:**
(1:02:13) That's right. Okay. I didn't know how to pronounce it uh when I picked that name, but yes, that's it's Cus. Criesus. Cries.

**Anders:**
(1:02:19) Gotcha. Um, any final words from your side? Anything you want to share or or tell people about and then we'll we'll we'll end it there.

**Jesse Myers:**
(1:02:26) Um, no. I mean, I I think uh I think my enthusiasm has come through about uh what we're what we're doing, the the path we're on, the boring path of just, you know, exponentially growing our uh our Bitcoin um assets held and and hopefully we continue that general trajectory into the future. Um, meanwhile, our MNAV is is at a remarkably low um level considering the recent uh Bitcoin yield delivered. Um, and uh, you know, so I think that if people are listening to the show, they they they've done their homework enough on Bitcoin Treasury companies to and are probably comfortable enough with the math necessary to kind of take stock of the value proposition propositions there. Um, so yeah, hopefully this has been informative to people and uh and they can do with this information as they will.

**Anders:**
(1:03:21) Well, um, Jesse Andy called it a master class. I'm just putting it up there again. So, so I agree. You know, quick um, and I promise to end it, but but quick top of the head math. um if you're reaching 210,000 Bitcoin in in 10 years or whenever and the market cap according to my thinking which is say may or may not you know hold true there'll be an endgame endgame MNAV of maybe 1.45 or 1.5 that would put your market cap at 300,000 Bitcoin and right now where you're holding a bit more than 2,000 Bitcoin your market cap is about 6,500 uh Bitcoin. So the growth into that is about a 40x in bitcoin terms not in dollar terms. The in dollar terms is or pound terms it's completely different obviously um game. So anyway so just wanted to add that. thank thank you so much Jesse. Glad to finally have you on uh on one of my five years ago. So looking forward to doing the next um next one of these with you and and we'll talk about what Smarter Web has done in the last few weeks at that point.

**Jesse Myers:**
(1:04:34) Yep. Absolutely. Yeah. I think you mentioned five years ago at Andy Edram's uh barbecue. Um I I recall that we did uh some internal calls um at when we're both actively engaged with with Swan Bitcoin a long time ago. I don't know, probably around 5 years ago as well or maybe four years ago, which is a long time in Bitcoin.

**Anders:**
(1:05:02) Yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's right. Anyways, uh thank you so much, Jesse. Thank you everyone for watching. Appreciate you taking the time. Um and um I'll I'll see you guys in the next one. Thank you, Jesse.
