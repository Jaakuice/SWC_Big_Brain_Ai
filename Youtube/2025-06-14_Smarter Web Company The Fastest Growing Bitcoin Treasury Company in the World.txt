**Tim Cottsman:**
(0:00:00) Welcome back to the Bitcoin Treasuries podcast. I'm Tim Cottsman. I'm here with Andrew Webbley, the CEO of the Smarter Web Company. Andrew, thanks for joining us today.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:00:08) Thank you for having me.

**Tim Cottsman:**
(0:00:10) So, Smarter Web Company's Big Bitcoin Move Adam Livingston just posted a video. And in the description, it says, "The best new Bitcoin treasury, question mark, smarter web company analysis." Smarter Web Company just pulled off one of the most explosive Bitcoin treasury moves we've ever seen. 168 Bitcoin in 43 days for 5,157% Bitcoin per share growth and you began trading over the counter today. Could this be the UK Metaplanet? So, we love Adam Livingston here. We talked a little bit about how much we appreciate and enjoy his material before we started rolling. Um, yeah. What are all the updates? What's what has the last few weeks um been like?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:00:45) Yes. So, it's been busy. Um you know, I actually before I jumped on this call, I I watched the first five or 10 minutes of that. I watched the rest of it later. Um it made me laugh because um he talked about tea and crumpets, you know, very British. Um, and um, and you know, as as far as I can tell, the stats that he's referring to are all very very accurate. You mentioned that we started trading on the OTC today. Um, you know, the volume was pretty good. Um, there was about 4 million pounds worth of stock traded. Um, another five million traded in London, so 9 million in total. So there's definitely demand for what we're doing. Um, if I look at our progress to date in terms of, you know, how we've announced the the the Treasury policy that we've implemented, um, you know, I'm really proud of that. You know, we've consistently stuck to the mission. Uh, we've been very transparent about it. We've declared whenever there's, you know, a significant amount of Bitcoin bought, which has resulted in maybe one, two announcements a week. Um, you know, everyone can look at the cash that we've got using publicly available information. you know, we've done a raise, you know, not quite every week, but almost every week. Um, every single raise that we've done's been at a higher price uh for a larger amount. Um, all of that interlin you see with those stats. Um, you know, and and and I I don't think it's it's um, you know, incorrect to say that we are the fastest growing public company with Bitcoin on their balance sheet. Um we're actually the the um the best performing UK equity as well. Um so so yeah, he you know he's right. Um you know he's right and we're really proud of it and we're you know as I said you know in Vegas when I did the talk a couple of weeks ago you know we are only just getting started.

**Tim Cottsman:**
(0:02:30) One of the questions that came in um from social media was if you could talk at all about um your cap table as far as in institutional investors. Um so yeah, any any uh comments that you can make on that front?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:02:42) Yeah, sure. So um before we listed the business um we had um support from UTXO. Um you know a lot of people know them as Nakamoto. Um now obviously with the tremendous work that they're doing over there um they've supported you know MetaPlanet Blockchain Group you know all of these great companies. Um so we we've had institutional support from before we even listed. Um when we did the IPO um I was very um focused on allowing retail investors to have the same opportunity as institutional investors. So on every raise that we've done um so far there's been retail support and there's also been institutional support. Um we're not at a stage um in the UK institutions need to declare when they own over 3% of a company. Um we're not at the stage um according to the publicly um available information where any one institution um owns over 3% of the company other than the original you know investors UTXO and and myself effectively. Um I so I can't name any names. Um what I can say is that you know we're really pleased with the support that we've got. If you look at the books, um, as they've they've grown, the percentage of the institutional versus the retail, you know, in part because it's been larger amounts of money, um, has got higher. Um, I've had some great calls. I had another great call today. I've got a great call tomorrow. I've got another great call on Friday. Um, you know, with people that, you know, are really keen to get involved. Um, I've had so many calls the last few weeks with different very well-known in a lot of cases investors, but my job as the CEO um of the Smarter Web Company is to try and attract the capital that's right for us at this stage. Um, so so if you look at all of the raises that we've done so far, they've all been at the market price. Um, I'm quite proud of that and you know that that's good. They've all been straight equity. Um so you know everyone's in at the same terms you know the new people that come in and the existing shareholders you know obviously you know in a few months time that will change potentially um you know in terms of different instruments converts and so forth um but at this stage in the business's growth I think um it's the right way of doing it um and you know if some of the institutions want to do it in a different way but it's not right for us then we have to do what's right for us and our shareholders. Um but yeah, we've we've got some good names that have come on board so far. Um some of them have said that they'll support, you know, further funding um that that we may do in the future. Um and I I don't know if you really pushed me and I had to guess, I'd say probably between one month and three months from now, you'll start to see names on the public cap table as opposed to the cap table that I look at, which I can't talk about.

**Tim Cottsman:**
(0:05:15) Got it. And can you run through what the tickers are that are trading? What tickers is Smarter Web Company trading under? just so everyone has that as a reference? Sometimes there's a lot of comments about like what is the ticker? Where is it? How can I h how can I even discover it?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:05:30) Yeah. Yeah, for sure. So, um because the US listing only went live today, I'm just going to double check that one. Um the the the main ticker is SWC. Um everyone calls us, you know, Smarter Web as opposed to the Smarter Web Company. So, SWC, which stands for Smarter Web Company. Um, and then today we went live on the OTCQB. Um, and the ticker for that is, um, is TSWCF. Um, there's a bit of a funny story about that one actually, which um, so that stands for the Smarter Web Company F. Um, and normally what happens is when you list a company or you get an OTC listing, the company picks the ticker. um because there was so much demand for our stock on the pink sheets um in the US before it became you know properly listed um in the US um we didn't actually pick that that was picked by you know the community investors etc etc so so you know I picked SWC as the ticker you know in the UK but the ticker um TSWCF was actually picked by you know the the world um as as opposed to Very interesting.

**Tim Cottsman:**
(0:06:30) Can you walk us through this metric months to cover that was popularized by Adam back and and maybe walk through like what it is and and where you guys are right now um with that metric and why that's important.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:06:45) Yes. So um so months to cover um is is a metric that people look at when they're looking at Bitcoin treasury companies and it's really simple actually. It just means, you know, companies with Bitcoin on their balance sheet trade at the moment at a premium. Um, and then people value the premium based on how they believe that company's executing the strategy and where it might go in the future. So if if you know like I hold six I think at the moment uh companies um that have got Bitcoin on their balance sheet um and when you look at those companies you want to understand um you know how they're going to grow into that valuation. So a lot of people call it months to cover. Um we call it days to cover. Um because if you look at us as a company, you know, dependent on which data you're looking at, it's around about 35. Um which is the best in the world as far as I'm aware. Um and so what that means is that if we maintain our trajectory within 35 days, our valuation will be one on one. Um i.e. you know we will keep acquiring you know the best asset in the world which is what we use for our treasury policy. um and then the valuation will um effectively not have a premium because you would have grown into your valuation. So you know typically the bigger the company the the um the longer that time period is um because of the additional capital required to maintain that trajectory that you're on. Um but it's as simple as that. It's how long is it going to take you to grow into your um market valuation assuming the management continue the pace that they're doing. So obviously if they increase what they're doing you're going to grow into it quicker. Um if you decrease what you're doing then you know it's going to go slower. So if you're an investor and you're looking at it you you want to look at things like how much uh Bitcoin are they buying? How frequently are they buying it? Um, and then you you can work it out. Um, and you know, we'll use one of the many many online tools. We we've actually got a really good community that's um been being been sharing the journey with me. Um, which is awesome. There's almost a thousand members on the X community now. Um, and one of the guys on there, um, Nick B, um, he's actually created a website. Um, and there's loads of things on there. It started as a bit of a joke with the the Webly tracker, which is, you know, the the UK version of the Sailor Tracker, which which was awesome the first time I saw it and and I still like seeing it. Um, but then he's also created this um SWC dashboard and it's it's brilliant. You know, I'm a developer so I like seeing those things and it's absolutely fantastic and and and a lot of the data that we've just talked about is all available there. So you can actually get to all the raw data so you don't have to go through all the announcements that you know independent people have put together and and you can see all of that. Um so so that's worth checking out as well. Um if you go to you know my my website my my X page know AJ Webley um you you'll be able to find a link to it there or just go to the smarter web community on X and you'll be able to find it there. It's a really good resource.

**Tim Cottsman:**
(0:09:30) What if anything has surprised you about the community over the past 30 some days? Because when I was just scrolling today, I clicked on an account and then I went to this YouTube channel and it's like, oh, this is for the community. It has absolutely nothing to do with like the company. I mean, it's covering the company, but it's not like the company's official YouTube channel. It's a community channel or a fan channel. So I mean this stuff is really have has legs and and spirits of of its own.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:09:55) Yeah, it's amazing. Um so as a company everything that we've done is all about honesty, transparency. Um and because that that's the sort of company that I want to invest in and the reason why we listed the company is because I wanted a company like this to invest in myself. Um so that's what we do as a company. Um, now the great thing about when you've got other people saying stuff about you, um, you know, obviously you do get the odd hater. Um, not many actually, surprisingly, considering our success. Um, but you you get people that, you know, want to share the journey with you. Um, and that's been the great thing about about the community that's been built up. You know, when when I went to Vegas a couple of weeks ago for the Bitcoin conference, which was amazing, uh, you know, we met each other there um, briefly. Um the you know lots of our our shareholders and our community came out to that and that was great. You know these tools that I was just talking about that people have set up you know really really good tools that you know takes a lot of time you know to do that development um has been fantastic. Um, one thing that really made me laugh the other day was um some of the uh like the images that people created and and and I I called my daughter down um and I said, "Yes, you know, have a look at this." Um and someone had put a my photo on, you know, sort of a Harry Potter and and she thought it was a bit cringe. Um but but it made me laugh and it's really cool to see everyone, you know, getting behind something that we all believe in. Um and and also with that comes quite a lot of responsibility on me, you know, that I'm sort of, you know, trying to navigate the ship um through through the path. One thing that's been really interesting with the community is in the early days, um I've always been very clear about the strategy, what we're trying to do. You know, we're an operating business and then we have the treasury policy and you know, that's um you know, it's it is that simple. Um and I believe based on being invested in Bitcoin for almost 10 years that my approach to the treasury management is the right one. It's what I believe in. Um I you know it's just a glorified version of dollar cost averaging really. Um obviously with an increasing amount of capital. Um and so I've been very focused that that is the without doubt in my mind the right approach. And in the early days, there were a few people that were saying, you know, spend it quicker, spend it quicker. And, you know, I've always stuck to my guns. We do spend it quick, as you can see, you know, fastest Bitcoin treasury company in the world. Um, but we we stick to that defined plan. So, you know, when I, you know, invest our, you know, our our cash into Bitcoin, um, I I I don't, you know, really look at the price, you know, I'm just slowly sticking to the plan. And you know, so that responsibility, the way I deal with it is, you know, I just stick to the mission. Um, and you know, so far, you know, everyone seems to like the mission.

**Tim Cottsman:**
(0:12:30) I guess I'm trying to understand, let's say you have x amount of cash that comes in and you kind of know, hey, I have a week before I'm going to have more cash. Would it be fair to say that you just kind of dollar cost average in over that week to accumulate that Bitcoin or whatever that period of time is before you think I'll probably have more cash in a week? So, as as opposed to just like smash buying over like an hour or a day. Is that fair or or do you mean something different?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:12:55) Yeah. No, that's pretty fair. Um, so, you know, it's a little bit longer than a week, but not much longer and we deploy the capital. um you know not it's not exactly dollar cost averaging but it's not that different to it um over that period of time um and and and then that gives it so one thing that everyone needs to be aware about is that as you become bigger and bigger and bigger that smash buy strategy becomes better um but when you're trying to build a company you know we want to be one of the biggest companies in the UK that get taken seriously globally um you know and I believe we're on path to do that you know in the not too distant future. You know, people are, as we've mentioned, people are already starting to take notice, but you know, my target has been a thousand Bitcoin is the the line when people take you seriously, you know, with this this particular strategy. Um, and um, you know, it's it's it it's just the way that that that we're doing it. But but so far so good, you know.

**Tim Cottsman:**
(0:13:45) Absolutely. [Advertisement break]

**Tim Cottsman:**
(0:18:00) What questions does Andrew get from investors? Can you share what questions investors have for you or prospective investors on these calls that you mentioned? Are there themes to the questions? Is there sometimes an education piece? If so, how often? Um, and yeah, I think that might just be helpful cuz if one person has a question or you see a theme in the questions that you're having on these calls on a daily and weekly basis, um, that maybe you know, some people listening might have the same questions.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:18:30) Yeah. One one of the questions that I get asked quite a lot is, um, you know, how capital raising works. Um, and the thing that I always say to that is that in the UK it's fairly similar to most other countries. Um the one exception that you've got is in the US um where you can do an at the market offering, an ATM offering. Um so that's when the company effectively sells the stock into the market rather than selling it to someone who will either hold it or sell it, you know. Um so um but largely speaking in the UK, you've got all of those sorts of tools and we're working with our advisers on some quite innovative solutions um for some of these different ways of doing things. you know as I said earlier to the benefit of the shareholders. Um so that that question comes up quite a lot. Um the other question that comes up quite a lot is what we just talked about which is the approach um you know in terms of how we deploy our capital. Um sometimes people ask us about the operating business. Um you know and because that's worth remembering as well because you know the operating business is important because it covers you know a large amount of you know the the the costs that the business has got for you know just existing you know staff and you know this sort of stuff. We haven't actually got that many costs other than you know a minimal amount of stuff but you know there are costs in any business and and and you know you either raise money to pay the costs and then to do whatever else you're doing or you have an operating business that can either pay the costs maybe make a profit maybe make a loss you know obviously I can't comment on that other than to say that we've been profitable for 15 years every single year without fail um but but that that is quite important and sometimes people ask about that because they want to understand, you know, how that's going to change over many, many years. And we've got some really good things that we're doing on that front as well. Um, I think that's probably the main questions that come up most frequently. Um, you know, in the early days, people used to say, you know, when's the next update and all that sort of stuff, but if you look at the updates that we do compared with most public companies, you know, it's it's quite hard to keep up with them actually now for for an investor. So nobody's saying to me when's the next update because, you know, they're probably getting, you know, at least as many as they would want, you know.

**Tim Cottsman:**
(0:20:30) Yeah, definitely. How do you think through the media side of the business, right? Traditional media, social media, these podcast sorts of interviews, the community, like like how do you think through it and how do you balance all of it? Because you have the call. I mean, I would just think there's almost an endless amount of things you could do um on the capital side or the communication side, if you want to call it that.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:20:55) Yeah. So, you know, being honest, it is a bit of a challenge to keep on top of everything, but again, we've got a plan on that front as well. Um so, you know, my job is obviously, you know, it's got lots of different elements to it. Um so you know typically you know a lot of the operational aspects um you know do consume more of the days um but then you know you book in the time to speak to different people um and you know you just do it on top of everything else. Um you know longer term um you know whether that's two weeks, one month, three months, whatever. Um, you know, clearly there will be more people in the business, but one of the things that I've been doing for the last couple of weeks is, you know, I've been taking the time to meet as many people as I can to find the right people because, you know, I believe a business is only as good as its people. Um, you know, I don't know whether the people are the very very most important thing in the business. You know, is the strategy the most important? You know, you know, it doesn't really matter. But without doubt, I think the people are one of the very most important things in a business. So what what I said to myself is that you know, you know, I can work pretty hard. You know, anyone that knows me knows that I get things done and I work good hours and, you know, all the rest of it. Um, but I've said that I really want to find really, really exceptional people to bring into the business. And if it means it takes an extra two weeks, four weeks or whatever to to to get those people, you know, once I've met them, met them, met them, you know, um you know, that that's worth doing. So, you know, I I I'm fortunate that we've got some really good adviserss. You know, we've got um an excellent um you know, broker. We've got an excellent an excellent um you know, nominated advisor. We've got great lawyers. Um you know, we use multiple firms for the lawyers, you know, accountants, all the rest of it, you know, and I can lean on those people to get things done as well. Um, so it's it you you just find your way at the end of the day. You know, when when you're in a business that's got quite a good sort of um you know, a growth story behind it, you know, clearly it it you know, time is is a bit precious. Um, you know, I um, you know, and I'm doing all right. There is quite a funny story about it though where um you know one of our um shareholders who's actually a really wellrespected chef um you know he's got a great business um and it's not actually that far from where I live um and he's organized the meal um and he he invited me to to speak at this meal in September and you know the food looks awesome you know um and and he he said to me you know would I like to bring my wife so I was I was out the other day and I said to my wife you would you like to come, you know, to this this event? You know, it'd be great. You could meet some smarter web company shareholders. And she said, um, she said, why would I want to spend, you know, an evening in the room with smart web company shareholders who have effectively stolen my husband from me. So, um, you know, but, um, you know, I'm not sure whether she's joking or whether she's being serious. Um, but you know, it's, um, you know, it's good. But, you know, as as the business grows, you know, there will be more people. So you won't only be speaking to me.

**Tim Cottsman:**
(0:24:00) Yeah, absolutely. So we have a question here um to the effect of how do you plan to handle investor relations? Certainly it seems like you've been handling a lot of the communications to date. Um so you know what are your thoughts on communicating engaging with shareholders? um and the investor relations piece, uh would you re label it shareholder marketing and branding or how how do you think about investor relations?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:24:25) Yeah. So, um so if if anyone emails us, you know, they'll get a reply. And um if you look at our emails, we haven't got any job titles on our emails. Um when I used to work at HL um before I set up the Smarter Webb company, HL being Hargreaves Lansdown, the largest investment broker in the UK. Um you know, one of the most successful companies ever in the UK. Um I was always told, you know, that that job titles were, you know, not so necessary. Um and so, you know, that that's that's how I sort of grew up in my professional life. Um, so in terms of investor relations, I I wouldn't really think that it needs a label. Like at the end of the day, your shareholders invest in your business because they see something that interests them, you know, whatever it may be. Um, and you know, fairly obviously the the potential to profit from that, which is why they trust you with their capital. Um and you know I think the investor relations side of things is core to everything that we do. How people think internally, how they make decisions, you know how the you know the you know the management decide to you know sort of reward staff you know like the shareholders should be at the forefront of every decision that a business makes you know and I think that's where a lot of businesses probably go wrong to be fair. So, so I think the way that we've done it so far where clearly, you know, I I do a lot of that, um, you know, we've taken a modern approach because, you know, the community which has, you know, come out of nowhere, you know, um, you know, they, you know, they're kind of like a modern way of doing investor relations and they're better really because you don't pay them. So, that's great for the business and for the investors. it's more genuine because you know they don't have all the information obviously but you know they're very good at research and they can work things out. So they're giving an an independent view really. So so so yeah I I I get the question but I don't think that it needs a different title. I think that we just need to keep doing what we're doing where we put it at the first at the forefront of everything that we think about. um you know you know clearly it would be good to have you know maybe one other person working alongside me because it's not just the investor relations piece um but there's some other things where you know I think um you know I I'm obviously you know like like like us all not not perfect on a lot of things that I do so you know improving the presentations that we put together and all these sorts of things as an example um you know and then they will speak to people as well but I I I you going back to what I said about setting the company up. I believe that people want, you know, transparency, honesty, hard work, all these sorts of things. Um, and and I think they just they just want people as far as a public company can give them all the information, you know, because obviously there's a bit of a lag sometimes on stuff because you're not allowed to say certain things. Um, I think that that's the right approach and, you know, hopefully most of our shareholders would see where I'm coming from there and support support that viewpoint.

**Tim Cottsman:**
(0:27:00) Yeah. That makes sense. Where do you see the most amount of inbound from? Is it or inbound in activity? Is it like if there was a top three or top five, is it like email, uh Twitter X, LinkedIn, uh some something else that I'm not thinking of?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:27:20) Yeah. So, um before we started speaking today, I was actually looking at our web stats. Um because you know I look at all the different stats for all the different things that we're doing. Um and you know that metric like every other metric is going up. Uh which is great to see. Um we put a lot of work you know obviously we're a web design company so it'd be a bit worrying if our website wasn't you know sort of up to date and you know relatively easy to use. Um so we do put a lot of work into that and you know we make sure that it's always up to date with everything you know where wherever possible. Um, so we see a lot of activity on the website. Um, you know, and and this isn't just about shareholders. This is about potential inquiries for the web design business. Anyone that emails into our business, whether we can help them or not, um, we will go back to those people, you know, with with with, you know, it used to be, you know, sort of within the hours. Sometimes it might take a little bit longer now. Um, but still, you know, much quicker than most companies would, you know, within two hours, three hours, whatever. Sometimes out of hours as well. Um, so yeah, we do get a lot of emails. We an awful lot of stuff on X, which is great. Um, because that that's probably the most alive bit of the whole thing. Um, I've been quite surprised by LinkedIn actually because LinkedIn's a lot more active than than I I thought it was. You know, I I haven't used so LinkedIn so much in recent years. Um, but it's, you know, it's it's pretty impressive. not as impressive as X um in in terms of the interaction and things, but what we always do is we put our content out on both of them set separately. It's all done manually. Um and you know, that's surprised me that that there's so many people, you know, that use that, you know, and and and contrary to what some people might say, LinkedIn isn't just people contacting us to sell us stuff. We get very very little of that. Um you know, it's just a different type of investor that probably uses that instead of X. Um, X is my favorite one out of the lot though, apart from obviously websites.

**Tim Cottsman:**
(0:29:15) Yeah, I would agree. X is my favorite place to hang out if I had a choice. Yeah. Um, are you able to see any sort of uh ratio of investor base in the US versus the UK or around the world globally or is it a smattering or is it like nope, it's mostly in the UK?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:29:35) No. No, not at all actually. Um, so you know, obviously we're, you know, we're a UK company. Um, but we've got a global audience. um you know if I look at the the trades for today for example you're talking you're talking almost 100% you know you know from from 100% of the volume you're talking you know I don't know what that is 40% 45% of the volume is actually in the states you know with the OTC listing going live um we get loads of messages from people across Europe um some from Asia and the Middle East of people asking how can they buy the shares you know or you know do you know a broker that we can use and things like that. So when I look at the web stats I can see that there is a you know there is obviously a focus on the UK and US in terms of you know and I think that comes from you know our directors um you know our investors you know our marketing you know people that are interested in this model but um you know there's a lot more people in different areas than than you would think um and and that's really cool to see as well um to see you know what we said at the start is that we wanted to have a really successful company that you the UK could be proud of. Um, and you know, in our own small way, I think we're we're doing that and we're showing that, you know, the the UK is an innovative place. It has got, you know, um, you know, people that work hard. It has got, you know, a thriving Bitcoin community. Um, you know, and all these sorts of things. We wanted to, you know, lead with positive stuff rather than negative stuff. You know, I obviously I love the UK most of the time. Um, but you know, sometimes it can be a bit negative about things, you know, whereas what I love about all of my American friends is, you know, they're so positive all the time about everything. Um, and so we wanted to, you know, have that attitude, you know, positive mental attitude and then, you know, good things happen, good things come and and and and that. So, but but but it's been great seeing the support from all these different people in all these these different places and, you know, hope hopefully that will only grow.

**Tim Cottsman:**
(0:31:45) Yeah. [Advertisement break]

**Tim Cottsman:**
(0:35:00) What are your takeaways from MetaPlanet still being the only Bitcoin Treasury company in Japan? I mean, they've been at it for a while now, well over a year, and there's still no other pure play Bitcoin treasury company. Of course, time is of the essence like all the time in business. Um, but yeah, what's your take on that? What your take your takeaways? Like it just seems wild to me.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:35:25) Yeah. So, their execution is fantastic. You know, they're hardworking people. Um, you know, they've they've what they've been going 14 months with the strategy, 15 months, something like that off the top of my head. Um, you know, it it's it is a bit surprising. Um because if you take the UK as an example, you know, there's there's a a number of tiny tiny little companies that have have have sort of, you know, came out with a sort of a, you know, halfass for one of a better description attempt at doing the strategy, but they're not really doing the strategy. They've missed the point. They haven't got the memo. You know, the point is that we do this because we believe in it. We believe Bitcoin is the best asset in the world. we want to keep our our our our cash as Bitcoin as opposed to as pounds or dollars or whatever. Um and and I think that's that's where um you know some of those companies are are going wrong. You know, you you know there's no point in doing something in this world unless you believe in it. You'd be better off you know doing whatever it is that you believe in. you know, um, you know, I I can't say why there hasn't been, you know, you know, one or two other companies come out in Japan or, you know, even in France, you know, with the the blockchain group, you know, they've done fantastically well as well. You know, absolutely amazing. You know, that that's similar as far as I'm aware. Um, then there's other countries, you know, like Germany is a good example, I think, where there aren't any yet. you know, there's obviously rumors of ones coming soon, but you know, as we're speaking today, there aren't any. Um, you know, whereas if you look at the UK, you know, we came out with with our strategy and then, you know, you got, you know, six, seven, maybe it's a sort of a reflection of the capital markets um, you know, in different countries. So one thing that you need to um understand when you work in capital markets which is obviously part of my background is that you know every capital markets got rules and it's also got certain quirks um and you need to understand that side of things and may maybe in Japan the there is there isn't and I don't know this I'm speculating but there is an you know an abundance of of you know sort of zombie companies or whatever you want to call them um which could then be utilized for such purpose. Um or or maybe no one's done it. Or maybe MetaPlanet has got so far out of the gate, you know, in their their um probably, you know, without being rude, probably not their early stages because their their growth was slower to be fair. It's really the last, you know, six, eight months when it's just it's just it keeps going. It is amazing to watch. Um so maybe that's, you know, scared people off. they thought, well, you know, why bother? We can't compete with that. Um, I I I don't know really. Yeah. I mean, it seems like it's just quite the opportunity for a MetaPlanet or a smarter web company when there's seemingly very little to no competition around. So, I mean, the thing the thing that I've learned, um, you know, is, you know, I'm very lucky. I absolutely love my job. um you know before we listed the business you know I left the business with the job of what it was at the time um and you know I think you know without getting too philosophical on on you that you know a lot of people don't absolutely love what they do um and and I think to do something like this well um to execute it properly you know it it's you know it's a it's a marathon not a sprint you know that sort of a thing so So I I I think you know those sorts of people that can do something like what Simon and Dylan have done at Metapanet for example. Um you know there there may be you know fewer and further between than than than you would think. And you know it takes you know I was having a a meeting actually um about two weeks ago with um an institutional fund manager who um you know didn't actually invest in that round. Um and you know I've spoken to him at all the rounds and you know he's he's a great bloke um you know apparently um you know one of the best fund managers who sort of obviously missed the very best UK public company opportunity. Um but what he said to me was um you know fair play Andrew you know this this takes real balls to do this you know and but you know I look at it in in a different way. If you believe in something um then you should go for it, you know, um you know, and and you know, keep working away to to make it work. So, you know, I I've never actually been to Japan, although I would like to go. I've been to lots of different parts of Asia, but never Japan. But maybe it's not a culture where you get the risk takers or the entrepreneurs, you know, and maybe that's part of the the case. But I think, you know, I think you'd be pretty brave to try the strategy in Japan at the moment because, you know, they're executing brilliantly.

**Tim Cottsman:**
(0:40:00) Where do you see the smarter web company going? Both the operational side and the treasury side um from here on out, say the next 6 12 months or so.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:40:15) Yeah. So, um so we've got three prongs to the business. We've got the operating business which is um you know going well. Um you know it works well well you know one of the team who leads that side of the business Alex is is doing an absolutely amazing job. Um clients are all happy. Um I think quite a few of them have bought shares in the company as well. So they're probably even happier now. Um so so that's quite cool. Um then we've got the middle prong which is our you know medium to long-term acquisition strategy. um you know, not really allowed to talk about that too much, so I won't um you know, there's there's there's different things going on there and we're we're evaluating lots of things. Um you know, we won't rush though. We'll only do the right thing at the right time. Um and then of course we've got the um the the approach to um treasury using Bitcoin. Um, so you know, I've said to everyone that my first target is is a thousand Bitcoin that I would like to have within the business. Um, you know, one of my fellow directors, Tyler from UTXO, um, who actually sits on the board of MetaPlanet as well, he um, and I have always said that, you know, we we we'd like to beat the, you know, the, you know, you always need a target, right? So, we we'd like to beat what MetaPlanet did, which was a thousand Bitcoin in in six months. I've always said that I'd like to beat a thousand Bitcoin in four months. Um, pretty sure that that's still doable. Um, might even be less than four months, you know, but let's not shorten it too much. Um, so I think that's the first milestone. You know, I I believe in continuous improvement. Um, I think that's evidenced by our performance to date. Um so you know all I would say on the treasury side of things is that we just continue improving the approach that we've adopted to our treasury management. Um and you know grow and grow and grow. Um and then those three different parts of the business should all you know fulfill my vision which is becoming one of the biggest companies in the UK. Um you know we've already ticked the box of the best performing UK equity but you know it is early days. Um and you know we've got really really big plans. So um you know will I be able to do it within the first year? Probably not. Become one of the biggest hundred companies in the UK. I think you know that would be quite difficult for anyone you know. Do I think I can do it within you know a couple of years? Yeah I think I can. Um you know and and and yeah we just keep trying to get better trying to keep treating people with respect. Um and you know just trying to do the right thing. you know, obviously we will make the odd mistake because that's, you know, us being human beings, but as long as we can keep, you know, the mission in the right path, um, you know, hopefully everyone will be quite happy.

**Tim Cottsman:**
(0:43:00) Some people are saying that um the move from $50,000 Bitcoin to $100,000 Bitcoin was in large part due to the ETFs and that the move from $100,000 Bitcoin on up. Let's not give a a higher number than that um will be due to Bitcoin treasury companies. Would you largely agree with that or are there other factors that you think are are like you know at least significant um contributors potentially to that to that move higher?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:43:30) I I think um you know I I think about this slightly differently to maybe some people but if we look back you know sort of let's say for as long as I've been investing in Bitcoin so almost 10 years you know there's always things that people can pin you know an up move or a down move on. But at the end of the day what those things all have in common is on the down move fear and on the up move adoption. Um, you know, I I think everyone, even people that aren't mega into Bitcoin, will will will accept that the adoption is getting better and better and better all of the time. So, you know, the way that I describe Bitcoin to people is, you know, it's like the, you know, you know, the sort of, you know, the money, you know, the internet money, you know, effectively. And I don't mean that as a medium of exchange. I mean you know if we go back 25 years you know when I started my career um and we think about the internet and then we think about the internet today and how we use it you know I'm talking to you you know on the internet obviously um you know we all use smartphones you know you know on the internet um you know we do everything on the internet so you know if you think about the Bitcoin network as you know the internet is a network you know it's no more complicated than that so I would just always refer to adoption rather than trying to pin a particular narrative on something like you know if we're honest yeah you know ETFs have been helpful you know Bitcoin treasury companies helpful load loads of things are helpful you know maybe this year we see lots of other sovereign um you know holders of of of Bitcoin perhaps um you know and you know the it's all about adoption it's no more complicated than adoption and then The other thing that you've got to think about when you're thinking about adoption is you've got to think, you know, in simple terms, you know, one of the reasons why I love Bitcoin more than anything else is, you know, the inflation busting properties of it. Um, you know, we all hate going to the shops and seeing that, you know, we're paying 20% more for this, 10% more for that, 50% more for this, you know, and and you know, it's it's Bitcoin succeeding or is it fear failing? you know, it's obviously a bit of both. I I suppose um but you know, it's all about adoption. Um and you know, you know, without being too cheesy, you know, the phrase that we're still early is so so true. If you look at all the people that you know, even with with you know, our business and you know, our treasury policy in terms of Bitcoin, there's a lot of people that can't understand it. It's not that hard to understand. you know, as Michael Sailor says, you know, you know, if you put the time into understanding Bitcoin, you know, you will realize that it's the perfect solution to so many things. And and and and and I think that that that is evidenced by the fact of what people say when they're looking at Bitcoin or companies that adopting Bitcoin on their balance sheet. Um you know, you you know, we are still early in that adoption curve, but it's getting better. Um, and I couldn't be more excited for the next 5, 10, 15, 20 years. Um, I think, you know, I don't put a target on the price of Bitcoin. I I don't think I need to. Um, I believe it's going up into the millions and millions. Um, you know, in that sort of time period, you know, maybe maybe, you know, years as opposed to 5 10 years, you know. Um, and and and yeah, it just comes down to adoption in my opinion.

**Tim Cottsman:**
(0:47:00) Makes sense. Um, I really appreciate your time. I'll throw it over to you if you have any closing thoughts and if you could share with people where to find you online.
