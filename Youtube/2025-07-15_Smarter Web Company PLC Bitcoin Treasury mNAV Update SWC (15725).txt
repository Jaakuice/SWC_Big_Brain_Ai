(0:00:00) Hi guys, Vostra here. How's it going? If you're new to the channel, make sure you subscribe. We do a daily share price review of Smarter Web Company, PLC. We look at the price action. We try and understand what's going on in the market. We update our financial model. We go through some X comments. And then stay till the end because I'll try and answer some of your questions. With that said, let's take a look at the share price close today, 15th of July on the Aquis website. We are looking at a share price, a bid price of £35. We then take the number £35. We input that into our financial model that we're running in the background. If you haven't had a chance to take a look and play around with the version of the model, make sure you click on the link in the description. We have the financial model here which Financial Model um as you can see is is building out quite nicely as the days and weeks go past. The main reason to update this is to understand where the MNAV finishes. um looking at share price on a daily basis is is not recommended but we'll do that anyway right uh so £35 uh by my model it gives a closing mnab of approximately 5.29 there we go 5.29 29. We can see that the MNAV has come down from the beginning of the U process. I guess you could call it a process. We're buying bitcoins here, issuing shares, raising cash, buying Bitcoin, and the cycle repeats. You want to buy as much Bitcoin as you can, as fast as you can, and raise as much cash as you can. That's the game. As you can see on column V here, we're the aim here is to increase the bitcoins per share. Um the way to do that is to always keep raising cash um at a positive mnav greater than one. And as long as we can do that, you can you can keep increasing the bitcoins per share. The uh bitcoin price currently hovering around $116,000. cooling off since the um God candles we've seen over the last couple of days. So um you can see that this model is quite dynamic. We take into account the Bitcoin price movements, the the capital raises, the share issuances we can attempt to model through and that's what we're doing here in the background trying to make sense of what's going on in the market.

**Vostra:**
(0:02:00) We look at the chart. Let's take a look at the Chart uh trading view chart now. Um the market is live currently over in the US. You can see the whole sector actually is taking um a bit of a cooling off. You could say profits, people selling, you know, price only goes one two two ways, right? Up or down. Generally, when it goes down, it's people selling, somebody's selling. Um everyone's selling in in the treasury sector. it seems. Um, so let's take a look at the US chart here. Blow that up a little bit more. You can see that it's kind of attacking attaching itself to the 0.7 support line there. Just trading below it. Wants to get back up. There is a little bit of a gap down here around the 350. If you ask me, that would be a very quick quick move down and take it take as much as you can type situation. But I think this wants to come back up um up through the the 0.7 and and towards the 0.618. I I can't really see see it staying hanging around these these areas for extended periods. Um, if I click to the uh UK chart where the action has closed for today, you can see that there was a a very clean bounce off the um 290 just below the 290 where the last book build was. So, it does want to support that last book build where the um uh go back to the model. You can see on book build raised number seven on my chart here on my uh um model 2.90 £41 million was raised at that point everybody not had a book build since then the ATM closed at £327 that was the the first trunch and then the subscription private subscription for 3.1 million happened for £325 you can see the books have tended to um potentially double each time. So, very interested to see if there is a uh a book build coming um soon. And we do know that there is a 14 million shares in the market being sold on up days only. So, that's something new that wasn't always prevalent. I um uh yeah, drawing your attention to the uh the book build there, that would take uh if that did happen, it potent. Who knows? Let's see. Um who knows what Mr. Webbley is cooking this week. Let the chef cook is is what I say. But as we as we seen here, the last book build has been protected quite well. um speculation, entertainment. This is no financial advice here. Never. I would think if there was a book build in in motion and you're trying to position in, would you not snap up these prices? Um I mean, could you not snap these prices up? And then that would be bid back up through to the 0.5 above through that. and then depending on whatever price it closes, finish the rest of the book build on a high. Um, just putting thoughts out there. Could happen. You never know. Anything can happen. So, hold your horses.

**Vostra:**
(0:05:30) I know some of the comments coming through on my YouTube channel is like, "What's going on in the market? Bitcoin price is ripping. SWC is tanking. The rest is tanking. Everything is it's yeah the markets are can be detached from the Bitcoin price. It's a volatile stock as I keep saying but we like the stock. You can see the structure of it. Um the trend I would say if if it this picks right back up then it would still be in line with trend. Let's see what happens over the next few days. Um anything can happen with that. Let me move across now to our next point on the agenda. X comments. Let's see what X is saying. We normally Comments take a look through X um on the Smarter Web company there right now as of recording. Andrew Andrew Webbley is on this live with Adrian Morris. So, I'm sure you guys are are listening with intent on on that. That'll be an exciting interview to see what the latest is coming directly from the man himself. Uh Wayne there saying expecting an announcement tomorrow could be you know when we look at some of the um previous announcements it feels like announcement could be around the corner um Meta web BTC bull if I'm being completely honest I respect Meta's first move meta planet's first move to add marketing t but I'm surprised they are filling they're just filling a contract yeah there's a lot of jobs out there in the in the Bitcoin in Treasury World popping up through um uh this industry that's developing. So that's exciting. Henry Bombie saying, "Great to hear Sri products are around the corner." Um from Asia. Okay. Wow. So that's a bit of news there. So these are the uh uh preferred uh uh equity type pro preferred debt instrument type products which will be um really interesting to understand more about as the time evolves. The uh who else? Excellent interview. So okay lots of good feedback coming up could Adam Livingston I could not possibly more more bullish on SOC even in my bare case is crazy. Yeah the bear case I will speak. So today you've got to tune in and subscribe to the channel. By the way, I interviewed Ragna. Some of you may know Ragna. Really exciting discussions there. One of the things we were talking about is and and this is nothing to do with uh you know what's happening here, but in some of the other treasuries, even if there's um you know, Bitcoin will save the day. Bitcoin is going one way. We've seen the price pumping, right? And even with the uh 1,600 bitcoins that there are there's um when it gets to $1 million, even if the the show just stopped now, you can do the maths. You can do the numbers. It won't it's not going to stop. A but B, let's say if you're, you know, jumping around thinking what's happening with the share price. Um even if you do some very basic maths, you can see that the the business will will will turn this around. Um and and that's uh that's just uh Bitcoin for you at the ultimate level. You I if you're invested in this and don't understand Bitcoin, I definitely suggest you you you start understanding Bitcoin. So yeah, take a look at the X community there for uh Smarter Web. Lots of excite there's I think over 3,000 members now. Um 3,500 members. It's it's building fast. Lots of people. Exciting stuff. Cool. the next points around that.

**Vostra:**
(0:10:00) So, moving on to the community x uh the Community YouTube comments. Keep these coming. These are always fun to um fly through. Devon Devon Kout 4512 reply. Yeah, thanks. Smiley face. Gap at 350 USD might be close. Keep watching. Fill your bags. Uh Dave in power 4512 would be good if you could add talk for your spreadsheet and days to cover says user wx9 whatever that is. Yeah this model is getting to be a bit of a beast the uh additional columns that I've had added in lately which I think I talked about in the other video that I thought okay let's have a look at the trajectory here. Um there's there's some comments out there and model there's so many models flying around so many incorrect models as well. Um be careful. These are all financial entertaining models. Do your own research. Um this metric here that I just want I've added is a very basic metric on the BTC per day run rate and you can see 136 million raised 1.8 8 million pounds per day. Um around 23 bitcoins being bought per day is the run current run rate per what this is showing me. Um as the next financial activities continue by the end of July I would expect to be hitting close to the 30 mark. Um, and that's what you what the, you know, at the end of the day, the more Bitcoin you're buying and and uh sustaining that um trajectory is is what for me is is is key. Um, MNAVs clearly key. But as long as it's uh above one, you can accrete positively, dilute positively, and um always be increasing your bitcoins per share cuz the bitcoins per share is the uh is is the number that we want to always go up. And that there you can see. Um so thanks for that comment. I'll take a look at adding more columns, but it's getting it's pretty robust at the moment. Kraken 88. I just sold my kidney to pick up more S SWC at this price. I would sell Wra's kidney, too, if I could. Hey, look, these uh the price is bouncing about and um you do your models and you do your calculations and and and then you get to your assessments and and at this price uh 5.29 MNAV. Yeah. I mean, this is that book build happened at 290. So you can make your own conclusions, but these are these look like good prices to me.

**Vostra:**
(0:13:00) Um, powerful Wraadamas, thank you for the update, says John Mahoney. Pat Dean 1773. There was a big sell at 8:52 a.m. for £460,000. That put the dampeners, but they can only sell once upwards tomorrow. Yeah, this is the thing. You have a bit of rotation. People that have come in earlier maybe need to take some profits for whatever portfolios they're running. Um and uh new people position in. This is um something that can easily happen. Uh Sandep Star great day was able to buy as low as $430. Yeah, it's like the smart ones are are lapping up the prices and could do with and could do that with BTC at all-time high. What a gift. This is the thing you guys people think okay the Bitco Bitcoin price is ripping and um why isn't this ripping as well. It's it's following a a trajectory but this is still very early days. It's only 3 months in for this company and um it's building the flaws is is the way I look at it. Uh Sandep Star again was able to 3.5x my position today at favorable prices. You know some people are sizing in here and this is retail right? But imagine if you're positioning in for the next build or something. These are very attractive prices and if you do if you you can move the stock quite easily with um positioning in at this level. Uh so something to think about. Sand deep star. I am an American admittedly know nothing about UK exchanges. However, I do recall that when I was a kid somebody said stock exchange. We only thought about the New York Stock Exchange. Then in the 80s MSF6, Apple etc. burst on the scene. The NASDAQ boomed and now the new NYC has lost. Would not surprise me at all to see this happen to the LSC as the leaders of the new economy like SWC emerge. The leaders of the new economy. Um I've got a a small video coming out soon about the Bank of England and how what SWC is doing is um quite uh make sure you subscribe so you get notified of that as soon as it drops. Darren Thomas, I added more today at4 $442 at 357,000 shares. You see a lot of people are adding to their bags. Drunken FR drunken. I do not like the price action as money maxi. I don't care BTC ethos. I don't care SWC having a great CE. I don't I do not care positive SWC community. I don't care cool SWC horse pictures. I only care about money. Hopeful SWC will show me the money soon. Show me the money. Oh god. Antifragilator says, "Then you won't make it. Bitcoin does not reward. Zero work. Your lack of conviction will be sold to me at the lowest price." Oh, drunken FR. What you're saying? Bought it around three and never sold a share. And yes, I don't have conviction as high as you. I only care about money. And no, I will not sell it to you or anyone cheap. It's not about that. It's all about how to get high return short period of time, which is more important. You can make 10x in one year. You can also make 10x every month. What standard you have for yourself? Don't you think you are smarter than nay? Admit you are not the best. Crikey drunken FR. You are certainly drunken FR, man. Um, you just want the money and get out. Get out. Get get the money and get out. Juice and get out. That's uh you got to extend time horizons, my friend. Bro, talk about the price crash. We need to understand why this is happening in the middle of an all-time high, says Dave Ting. We just talked about that. Patience, people. Patience. This is the game. You can see the floors are building. Bitcoin per share. It's not going to be magic overnight, but there's certainly a lot of magic coming through from SWC from what I can see. Everybody, this is Vosra signing off. Ciao.
