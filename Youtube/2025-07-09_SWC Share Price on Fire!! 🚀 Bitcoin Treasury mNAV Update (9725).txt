(0:00:00) [Music] He's about to paint his masterpiece. [Music] Ladies and gentlemen, hope you had a great day. Mr. Andrew Webbley is on fire today, right? Would you not say? We woke up today with the announcement that there was Yeah, just a casual 10.3 million pounds dropped in. What was that? Let's uh let's quickly check the announcement. Then we'll go to the share price close. Then we'll look at the model. Then we'll speculate. We have to speculate to accumulate. Do a quick Q&A. And then that should be me.

(0:00:30) The Smarter Web Company raised£10.3 million at £325 per share. That was through issuing just over 3.1 million ordinary shares. Um, it's expected the admission of the new ordering shares will become effective at 800 a.m. on or around the 14th of July. So, what a start to the day that was. Um, let's now go to the share price. What did we close at today? Let's double check that. 3.73. There we go. Everything seems to be moving in the direction that we've been sort of expecting over the last couple of days. Nothing in this video is financial um advice. So, please bear that in mind.

(0:01:00) With that said, let's check the share price action. Okay, SWC. So, Trading View, the price that feeds in here comes in a bit late. So as you can see the difference between the ADVFM price 3.73 and then um the trading view price just takes a bit longer to update. But you can see ladies and gentlemen the 0.618 last book build 2 pound 90. We talked about that yesterday the other day we've smashed through the 3.54 mark um at a point today it was also trading just um just above there. You can see it got slight rejection, but we did say that the wicks will get filled. There you go. That wick was filled. So, it's settled about round about the just below the 3 0.382. Um, and what we can do with that information is just go over to our model and see how all of that impacts the updates.

(0:01:45) So, bear with me. We've we're taking the 3.73. We now flick across to our live model so we can see what is going on with the action. It is becoming a lot of uh work keeping this updated I tell you because by the time these videos come out there might have been a book build and then this is out of date information but we're doing a better job than the Financial Times. So I'm I'm happy. Um, so let's let's roll with this strategic. I put a question mark here. It's literally just um a direct placement. It's not even a book build. Um, so let's start moving that. That was done at 325. We raised uh issued 3.1 just over 3.1 million shares. Um, and that increased the shares by just over 1%. Market cap there. Capital raised. Great. Great. That takes the business just over 1,600 bitcoins if you're looking at it from a forward forward calculation perspective. That's the word. Net assets of just over 131 million pounds. the business. If you if you just take a step back when you're looking at these numbers dayto day, the you can forget the achievement, but that's 136 million pounds. 136 million pounds in 52 odd days or something. I did make a post about this. That's, you know, just shy of3 million pounds a day. That's the run rate. And and that could be increasing. Um, mind-blowing, mind-blowing stuff.

(0:03:00) Um, okay. And then, so what mnav did the um placement there? Close that. That's just o over six by my calculation. Great. So, all of that gets um greened. Let's put that in. Green. Right. What's going to happen next? So the business is closed at 3:25 373 right now. So 373 376. Okay. So approximately trading at 7 mnav 7 mnav. There could be there could be a book build later today. Who knows this week. The other thing I was wondering is there might not even need to be a book build because with the ATM shares working in the background, the 14 million shares, those get printed all the time. So if the pressure is big enough, they might be getting sold out. I mean, you can only do 20% of the volume. So that ticks across in the background anyway. But let's um let's imagine there's another. So, I can't imagine the next raise not getting over the 2,000 Bitcoin mark. Um, and that would approximately Oh, look. Can you see the performance performance issue? This is um SWC is it's going too fast for my computer. 41.4 4 million pounds could be raised if it just raises it at the at the close price. But we're tracking the Tennyson target in tandem. Now, I know yesterday's video I said when if you get up to 8.54, you would uh you would get to the Tennyson um price target of £425. You can see that that's come down now to about 7.9. So, it keeps coming down and that's because you're adding more assets to the balance sheet because of this strategic question mark um raise that was done today or placed. The MNAV doesn't need to get all the way back up to 8.54 to actually meet Tennyson's target. So, um on that note, yeah, currently trading at 7. Um, if you put in 7.9, I think that's what the pricing we did. Yeah, you get to the4 pound 25. So, this is looking like it's shaping up to be uh moving in the right direction, I'd say.

(0:04:30) There you go. You see this chart moving as we speak, even after close. Um, so yeah, we bounced about there a bit between the 0.618 and the 0.5. the let's take a quick look at the the US chart. The US chart is uh the US market is still live. You see that there in dollar terms it's trading around the 0.618 range where you would expect it to. Um it still hasn't reached the second the next bar the 0.5 which would be about $6. Um, at $6 you would uh quick quick quick quick quick quick maths here that would be about £4.37 then that would take take it across to the tennis target over the tennis target. I wouldn't be surprised if it reaches this. Um, so yeah. Okay. So that's all going well I would say. Would you? Amazing. I mean that's moving up as we speak. This is the problem. We need 24-hour news on this now because uh as soon as a video goes out, it's out of date. It is out of date. This is remarkable stuff. We're watching history unfold. I don't want to be bigging up uh something that's uh um but I've Have you seen things like this? I've never seen anything like this. Um yeah, I'm in awe. There's a bit video. What I did today was as soon as I I saw this drop, I just tried to capture my reaction. So, I'll drop that video tomorrow. Let's see.

(0:05:45) Uh, so 14 million shares are currently being sold in the background. That could be Let's see. Let's see. Let's go back again. So, let's just put this down to imagine this was just the book build running in the background and no more other activity. You you would that's 14 million shares, those two together. It's again sandbagged, right? This is moving faster than this model is. 5th of August across that. That's that's another 60 million pounds. You can see that that builds on the previous raise. Brilliant. Fabulous stuff. Great stuff.

(0:06:15) Right. Shooting through Q& A. Actually, before we get to Q&A, just wanted to shout out Nick. Nick B in the community. He is doing some amazing work on um just explaining exactly how this is working. Um that take a look at his last post. How can you increase the Bitcoin that you hold by doing so absolutely by doing absolutely nothing? Let me show you. So he goes through the how the compounding of the bitcoin is happening and um the big question when people ask what what a bitcoin treasury company is doing is why would I hold bitcoin treasury company over holding bitcoin directly? Now there's a lot of you know I have your own bitcoin as well but have have some compounding going on as well. Why not have have a bit of everything? Um so he explains really well here uh the the company's increasing the bitcoin per share meaning your share of the bitcoin on the company holds constantly growing you're effectively able to multiply the number of bitcoin you hold yeah go through this example this is brilliant stuff

(0:07:00) questions Q&A start at the start at the bottom here there's a few that I know I didn't answer um drunken are how fast do you think SW stock price will hit8 that's 10 11 USD this check my new video out tomorrow if if it does it's going to come out tomorrow um the the stock is volatile as you can see so the the I can I can't predict when it will hit Boston style but what we can look at is the model and the way this is going is the elev. It's like an elevator build. We're getting flaws each time there's new fundraisers. So, it will get there. How fast do you think? I mean, look, let's quickly let's quickly do some Nostradamus. This sandbagged model predicts it by, you know, just before October. I mean, it could happen. It could The thing is this stock can shoot and then it will come down. And then so that you could argue it could trade much sooner than that. But what what this model enables you to do is view the flaws that are building because that they're building the net assets at the same time. You see, and then you have some reasonable um MNAV trading multiples and therefore the share price has to uh get to a certain extent. But in the short term or the medium-term or whatever, you know, this this this can this can fluctuate, but it will As long as the capital plan evolves, this is the key capital plan, then you will get there. Um, no financial advice.

(0:08:15) Where are we going? Here we go. Ah, where where's your question? There we go. How fast do you think? Oh, there's more questions. This this channel there's Okay, I'm going to tick yours because I'm getting confused now. Okay, let's start. That one's done. There's more questions. Uh, Cap Capria 1977, keep the quality content coming, please. Wostradamus. Yeah, that's where I got the Wraamas from as well because somebody mentioned that. Thanks very much. Boom. Andy Smith. Hi from Devon. I'll tell you, we need to get some uh sound effects going on some of these uh videos. I'm trying to You You'll notice at the beginning I tried something there, but experimentation, that's what it's about. Evolve. Hi from Devon says Paul Cotm Kraken 88. Please welcome your 139th subscriber and the best one yet, me. Welcome. Welcome to the party. We want to try and get to 1,000 subscribers so we can go live. I think you can go live before that, but it's 1,000 and we we'll do this live and share the journey. Brilliant updates. Thank you, Vostra. Uh, I really enjoy Wra's non-professional, laid-back approach on this YouTube videos, yet it is truly valuable. This is this is a mixture of financial entertainment. There's a lot of good great entertainment going on out there. And I kind of started this up as a bit of a you get bored watching the share price on its own and and not sharing your thoughts. And I thought I'm I was going mad. I thought I was literally the only one in the UK that's following this. But great great to have found this community and and we can keep each other sane. Um you know that it's volatile right? So one you know one week you might like the other week when it was all crashing people were you can you can sense the uh you can sense the atmosphere in the community but we'll be here where whichever way it goes.

(0:10:00) Um how fast. So I answered that just before this is your most impressive video above all. That's you're referring to the the investor deck. Yeah. Do check out the um so I'll try I'll do these quick updates and then I'll try and do like a bit more of a what they call um things that you can just view in your own time type stuff. This was referring to the investor deck. That's got a lot of information there. Ab I think I remember you. You were saying that you should just do three or four videos a week. If I did that, you would never have got this video. So good job. We we're we're cranking up the volume here. Um, hi Wra please confirm it is possible to get copy of all these slides to my email address in order to understand more of SWC and it's nonBT actually do you think I'm in the investor relations department or something you go to their website you can you can do all of that there amazing mate posted you on X post it everywhere this is gen once in a lifetime generational stuff I I really still think this is early um Andy Smith ASAP. What will your finance friend say when you tell them you're a YouTuber now? Oh, my f They don't know. They don't know what's going on. They think I'm a DJ. Um, a lot of people don't understand Bitcoin. If you don't understand Bitcoin, I don't know how you're going to understand these treasury companies. Really don't. Um, and that's where the people that's where the opportunity is, I guess, as well. If people don't understand Bitcoin, you're front running them if you know what's going on. Uh number one fan here ETSs go buddy so good and very encouraging stuff Vostra thank you and love love the sign off on today's video you like that kind of yes sign okay I'll I'll try and remember to do that uh sirill great stuff keep going fella farmer F4F great content thanks for the hard work

(0:12:00) yeah quick question on the model please playing around with the Bitcoin price times to 218K. So if the Bitcoin price goes to 218K, it seems the share price goes up to £114 at ATM9 compared to £11 when the Bitcoin price itself is left at current level with the MNAV unchanged. Would you accept that expect that kind of difference? No. So what you need to do with this model, so I've like the the live model that I've got like I'm not I can't I haven't got as much time to update the um let's say the example model. Um but what I can say to your comment there is that I would not expect it to get to what did you say it was there £114. I wouldn't expect it to get to 14. What you need to do with this? So, it's all boils down to this capital plan and how you think that will evolve. Can Andrew keep sort of getting plugging the the capital markets to get reasonable level of funding on a trajectory as he is doing so far. So, if you take the model and you're just going to input let's say let's do this live. Um, what was your I thought 218 I think you said. um smash that in there. You will if you keep everything else the same. You're saying that yeah, this this ATM here gets up and I've changed numbers slightly since your the the model you're referring to gets up to 130. What you've got to realize at that point if the Bitcoin price doubles like that which by the way this model the one the pricing that I'm looking at is very sandbagged also because if Bitcoin rips like this you can see the impact it wouldn't be as as um spectacular as this just to calm you down slightly. The reason for that is because if you just look gr glance across and look at the capital raise column to get to those levels of of share prices, Andrew would need to raise like 500 million clips, 700 etc. So what you need to do in that instance is you see this column H the you have to taper those down. Um and that will give you more reasonable levels of what the capital appetite could be like you can then model that to uh model that forwards to what it's been so far. I did have a quick look for you because I like that was a very good question by the way. I love the positive comments, but I also want like like what you've just asked because that will then help us develop this further. So, I did the same just before 218. You're saying if the Bitcoin price rips to 218, what happens to the pricing? Well, you you would taper down the share issue. You would dilute less because your net assets is has doubled uh effectively at that point. So, you're diluting, you're issuing less shares because you you able to raise um a decent amount of capital. And I've had a just a very quick rough um go at this, but you can see then in your ATM9 query, it wouldn't quite get to those levels, but it does get to uh you know, this shows me 51 pounds. Um, and this is a very high level, no financial advice type model, but that would make sense to me because what you get with a Bitcoin Treasury company model is you're getting what's called leveraged exposure. So, if the Bitcoin p if you just held Bitcoin and that ripped to 218, you would double double your money. But if you hold a stock in the Bitcoin treasury company, you would get to three, four, fivex more exposure on your um on your on your on your capital there because this is these you expecting the multiples to be um around the four to five mark at that point if it did rip to 218. So that's why yeah look when you look at a 51 pound and calm your horses people because you anything can happen right but this just shows you the power of the model this is what they call and it's very um let's say because there is no debt involved in this business to call it a leveraged Bitcoin equity play is a very confusing for a lot of people so bear that in mind

(0:15:30) we we've ticked about the you made me fail the 15minute mark test, but that's because that was a great question. I hope that answered it. Vosra signing out. Ciao.
