**James:**
(0:00:00) Jesse, welcome back. Um, first time we've spoken in 2026 and since the LSE up listing. So, um, you I think you've you and Andrew have spoken pretty extensively about that um, on other podcasts and stuff. Um, I actually wanna go back to basics with my first question, which is, um, can you explain to people why they might want to invest in a Bitcoin treasury company like SWC over say spot Bitcoin?

**Jesse Myers:**
Yes, absolutely. Uh, good to talk again, James. Um, we'll have plenty more of these in 2026, I imagine. Uh yeah, so the value proposition of a Bitcoin treasure company is is quite simple. Uh to me, I think this explanation applies to most potential investors. Uh I think there are other fringe reasons why you might want to hold a Bitcoin treasury company, but I think the the main reason is that a Bitcoin treasury company's value proposition is that it can increase your Bitcoin ownership over time. Uh and that is the concept of of Bitcoin yield. Um it what it what it really means is that we utilize capital market tools uh to execute a series of transactions when um conditions are favorable in order to increase the amount of Bitcoin per share. uh and and so that's you know a range of historically it's been mostly equity transactions issuing new equity when our MNAV is at a premium such that we can you know we are increasing the amount of Bitcoin that we hold more than we are increasing the amount of shares that are that are in issue. So you know while it is a dilute dilutive in terms of issuing new shares it is more um there's a greater gain of Bitcoin than there is a increase of shares. So that nets out to a a creative transaction for shareholders. It increases the amount of Bitcoin per share. So, in my mind, that's an incredibly compelling value proposition because for Bitcoiners, um, the the thing that every Bitcoiner wants, uh, and is incredibly elusive is how do I get more Bitcoin? How do I grow my Bitcoin ownership? There's only 21 million Bitcoin. Um, it's it's very hard to grow your Bitcoin once you're once you've deployed it. And and obviously with spot Bitcoin, you you don't grow your your Bitcoin ownership. You have what you have. Uh and that's the value proposition of a Bitcoin treasure company is that, you know, we can a well-run Bitcoin treasure company if it succeeds can grow your Bitcoin ownership considerably. Um for example, Strategy in 2025, I think it ended up with like 22% at a point in time. they were at 27% somewhere 20 to 30% um increase of Bitcoin per share. That's what a mature Bitcoin treasury company can do in a year. So, you know, let's say let's say that uh Smarter Web hopefully is able to deliver 20%. I think that might be conservative um but but that'd be a good outcome too. Uh 20% a year for the foreseeable future. Um, so what is the value of of you know a Bitcoin position that compounds you know that grows at 20% a year for a succession of years. Um, you know that in my view is is worth more considerably more than than 1x MNAB. That's considerably worth more than than than one unit of Bitcoin today. uh because of that future growth in Bitcoin per share. So, you know, that's that's I think how I that's how I view a Bitcoin treasury company. That's its role um is it it it is this capital market tool, this capital market vehicle for um arbitrageing tradisms to grow Bitcoin ownership for shareholders. uh and and and it can do that at a quite considerable rate um that the market currently is not uh pricing in.

**James:**
Excellent. Um, so does that make Bitcoin per share like the key metric then that that we should be looking at? We should be following, you know, comparing. Well, you can't compare uh companies with that, right? Because different share values, different Bitcoin per share.

**Jesse Myers:**
Yeah. You know, I think that's I think the the key metric that we care about is uh you know, strategy calls it Bitcoin yield. um the amount that you are increasing Bitcoin per share in a unit of time. Um and that is volatile. Uh that's subject to market conditions. Obviously, it was a lot easier to um increase Bitcoin per share when our MNAV was considerably higher. You know, in hindsight when uh enthusiasm for Bitcoin treasury companies was was near at or near its peak back in Q2. Um but you know as Andrew points out the our since our our local price top at the end of June um Smarter Web has added uh has increased Bitcoin per share by 50%. um during what has been a a bare market for for the company and and for the Bitcoin Treasury company space globally uh in the eight months since?

**James:**
Okay. And over the next two to three years, what in your opinion changes most for Bitcoin Treasury companies? Like where do you see it going in the next two to three years?

**Jesse Myers:**
Uh yeah, I I wonder uh what'll happen. Um but I think it's going to be some amount some degree of uh sort of narrative consolidation around leaders and well-run Bitcoin treasury companies. Um, and you know, my view is that the that sentiment for Bitcoin, uh, I think it's I think it's not a controversial statement to say that sentiment for Bitcoin oscillates. Um, that, you know, there are periods where people are extremely excited about Bitcoin and its future and and and get greedy. People want more Bitcoin. And then there are periods like recently where the narrative um flips and people are just, you know, the the the broader market is just not very excited about Bitcoin at all. Um and that just keeps happening. There's just a a sine wave of sentiment for Bitcoin. I think that Bitcoin treasury companies are by and large downstream of that. Um, I think when you are excited about Bitcoin, you get you you know, you're highly confident it's going to several hundred,000 per coin. You want as much of it as you can get. At that point in time, the value proposition of of micro strategy becomes very um salient uh and exciting to you because here's a way where you can not only get, you know, have your your Bitcoin exposure because of the Bitcoin on their balance sheet, but the promise of growing that um Bitcoin ownership through Bitcoin yield into the future is very compelling. So that's when sentiment for Bitcoin Treasury companies, I think, swings in the in the positive direction pretty hard. Um, and and and frankly is in a more amplified way than than Bitcoin's um market sentiment swings. So I think that in in times when Bitcoin has been trending up, Bitcoin treasury companies will become hot again. uh this has already happened and people quickly forget that because strategy in in the depths of the bare market in 2022 traded at a 0.7 MNAF um and uh and then in 2024 was at a 4x mnav and and that's strategy you know the the mature juggernaut that already had 1% of all the bitcoin in the world at that time um so you know that's the kind of um volatility that's possible for MNAVs for an already quite large and established Bitcoin treasury company. I I would expect that uh volatility of MNAV is more likely than not more pronounced for a smaller Bitcoin treasury company because you know if you get excited about Bitcoin and then you're excited about the the the model of you know growing Bitcoin ownership uh and then you are dealing with a company that has a smaller market cap has more potential upside because it doesn't hold that much Bitcoin right now and if it was able to achieve you know, metaplanet scale, you know, of of treasure holdings or, you know, get to 1% of all Bitcoin, you know, that would constitute, you know, an order of magnitude more uh upside than for for a smaller Bitcoin treasury company than for the than for strategy. Um so I I think that that you know you can get you can see how the market when it's in that state of excitement about Bitcoin um can very easily get super excited about Bitcoin treasury companies again. Now, I'd caution that, you know, there will probably be a a permanent hangover of um weariness about MNABs getting high and and for that and for that reason primarily, I doubt if um MNAVs will get to 20x again as they as they briefly did. But I wouldn't be surprised if if you know MNAVs for small smaller Bitcoin treasure companies get to 8x the way they did for for MetaPlanet in about a year ago this time this time a year ago. Um so again we'll see. But I think that you know I'm un undeterred about you know the future for Bitcoin treasure companies and certainly for smarter web. I think it's a matter of time. That's my personal view. Um, and it's and it's a matter of time for Bitcoin to trend positively, run hot for some amount of time. And during that period of time, I think we'll see an inevitable um uptick of of, you know, fresh interest in what a Bitcoin treasury company does. in large part because I think strategy will be quite successful during that time. It's, you know, amplified Bitcoin is is their whole model right now. So, they're, you know, they're trying to find like a 50% amplification of their Bitcoin balance sheet. Um, and so if Bitcoin rips, you know, if Bitcoin is up 200%. Then strategy without any MNAV expansion would be up 300%. Um and and then of course if there's sort of MNAV expansion because people get excited about that outperformance then that's even even even more upside for strategy. Um so you know like just kind of taking it back to that that uh you know taking stock of the logic uh and the thesis you know keeps me extremely excited about about Bitcoin treasury companies in general and then especially excited about Smarter Web because of its role in the global Bitcoin treasury space and its you know leadership position. position in the UK. Um, which, you know, recent analysis which will be coming out soon. Um, you know, has me freshly excited about like London is the second most important financial center in the world. And, you know, there's going to be a leading Bitcoin treasure company in every significant capital market. And if smarter web is in that position to to you know to be the leader in in the UK that's a huge opportunity um especially you know with a future of of hopefully getting to um you know preferred equity instruments and uh and and eating market share away from other fixed income products in a fixed income he heavy uh capital market.

Thanks. That's a bit of a a long answer. That's everything that I have to say right there.

**James:**
Well, do we do you want to end there?

**Jesse Myers:**
That's probably that's every all you that's all you all need to hear.

**James:**
I mean, that was kind of the point of the question was to try and get people to revisit the thesis, right? Um why did we do it in the first place? Um okay, so was it June or July that you kind of started with Smarter Web? I know.

**Jesse Myers:**
Yeah. Well, uh I guess June is when it started to be public. I had been kind of helping for about four weeks before that.

**James:**
Sure. Um so since that sort of initial appointment and then your your official appointment um as head of Bitcoin strategy um has the sort of treasury strategy evolved over that time and has it then is it now evolving due to being LSC uplisted?

**Jesse Myers:**
Yeah, it's a good question. um it hasn't really evolved. You know, it's it's quite a simple model. Uh you know, I always point to MetaPlanet because MetaPlanet is the the model of what you can do as the first uh and leading Bitcoin treasure company in a capital market that's not the US. Um you know, in the US you have to compete with strategy. You have to differentiate in some way. Um, but if you're MetPlanet, you, you know, get out of the gate first. You run hard. You develop that, um, you know, retail community of, uh, of, you know, high conviction Bitcoiners who see the model, have trust in management, are excited about it, and you keep building from there. And they've they've done that. And, and part of that, I think they kind of stumbled into. they they just thought it was a great capital market. They was a strategy worth trying and then that's that's ended up ended up being you know the reason for their success is is how they went about it. Uh and so you know we're we're approaching it we have been approaching it the same way from the beginning. That's part of why I wanted to work with Andrew is I saw the you know pattern recognition of like you know he's he's going about it the way that MetPanet went about it. Um and and I think that that's the winning model. Um you know it if anything that the obviously it's unfortunate that the tide went out very quickly um and quite fully for Bitcoin treasury companies as a model. Um, it's frustrating because I think that's, you know, personally I think that 95% plus of Bitcoin treasury companies uh or purported Bitcoin treasury companies um are not, you know, well-run or or are not executing the strategy in the in the way that I think makes sense to do so. Um, I've, you know, I've never been a fan of the pipe model because that the pipe model inherently relies on the secondary market absorbing, you know, being exit liquidity for for institutional investors who get a discount upfront. But how are you going to develop that secondary market of, you know, retail investors who are happy to buy that stock off of the institutional insiders, you know, like like that that never made sense to me. Um, and I think it's being been proven uh to be quite a flawed model in that regard. And you know, no surprise that liquidity has dried up for a lot of those vehicles because retail is smart. Retail doesn't want to be treated like exit liquidity and retail deserves to be respected. Um, and and you can't win without having, you know, the respect uh and trust of retail such that they want to buy the stock when they think it's undervalued, you know, like like full stop. You need you need that. Um anyway, so you know, I think that when you talk to uh sort of everyone who's not a diehard Bitcoiner, um about Bitcoin Treasury companies right now or DATs as they like to, you know, they like to lump in crypto with with it, uh they there's a there's a quite a barrier to um serious engagement because they think that Oh, well that that's not a hot thesis right now. That that's um everybody got burned by by Bitcoin Treasury companies or or DATs. And yeah, they did get burned by the pipe deals and poorly run Bitcoin treasury companies. Um and and you know, like our stock sold off heavily uh you know, because we got lumped in with with all of those other companies. Um but I think that you know I think that over the next couple of years the sort of fundamentals will have time to um continue to to bear out. I mean I've definitely noticed uh especially in our conversations with institutional investors in London how on the other side of the table it's quite clear that they are trying to understand like okay so smarter web is still healthy like first of all why you know why are you healthy and these other ones that we talked to you know six months ago who came into the same office and talked you know sat at the same table and told us why they were going to win. Why did they why did they not have liquidity anymore? You know, it's like so so bit of educational effort there. And of course, you have to be quite polite about it and and not and not say uh that it was doomed from the start because you know you guys were seeking well the the whole model was to to get institutional investors discount and rely on exit liquidity from retail. can't really say that to to institutional investors but um so you know yeah the the yeah I lost my train of thought a little bit there but yeah obviously I got got wound up on that but oh yeah so you know like in in meetings in London um it's quite clear that that they increasingly see smarter web as the name synonymous with Bitcoin Treasury company in the UK. Uh, and some of them understand what that means. Some of them understand like, okay, they're trying to be micro strategy for the UK. Some of them don't know about micro strategy and they're just like, okay, this is like some equitized Bitcoin thing. Um, but but increasingly that, you know, there's liquidity there and not liquidity elsewhere. And you know, so little by little, Smarter Web has continued to separate from the pack uh in the UK during this downtrend. And you know, we we talk about it internally. It's about stacking little winds. um in a time when it's tough to to you know you're not going to get the the big uh splashy wins um of you know you're not going to go out and raise a billion dollars right now but you can you can make little wins that help continue to underline that you're doing well you're healthy and you're continuing to build on that lead uh and others are not. So I, you know, I think that's what's going on right now. Um, and and that puts, frankly, puts Smarter Web in a in a really good position for whenever Bitcoin does start to trend up. And we can talk about that, too. I have, you know, thoughts on on that. um you know whenever Bitcoin does trend up and people get excited about Bitcoin and that sort of 2022 to 2024 shift of sentiment about Bitcoin treasury companies may may hopefully happen again. uh and that and then at that point in time smarter web will be hopefully you a fair bit stronger than we are today and everybody else by and large you know all the the 95% of of Bitcoin treasury companies that don't have a great model uh will be that much worse um and and yeah I think I think the institutional investors are sort of wrapping their head around okay this this may be the winner here in the UK and you know strategy is very attractive and has has succeeded immensely. Metaplanet has succeeded immensely. Um we like the UK market. We think this model could work in the UK market, you know. So what what what are your what are your conclusions from that? and and and and it's also just like a a matter of relationship building and getting that message out in front of um curious institutional investors who, you know, they have to get comfortable and and the only way you get com comfortable if you're not a Bitcoiner and you don't understand it yourself, um is by talking with somebody every six months for for you know a period of time and then and then seeing that yeah they are executing over the course of that period. Um so yeah that's that's what's going on.

**James:**
And um I think it was yesterday or it might have been today uh BTC Inc. and Naka and UTXO completed well sorry Nakamoto completed the the purchase of of those two and 210K Capital who are invested in SWC are a subsidiary of UTXO. So what does that mean now for SWC?

**Jesse Myers:**
Yeah. Uh I I I suppose nothing has changed there. Um uh yeah, so 210K is the fund that it uh that UTXO is the is the GP for, right? So it's the management entity that it's the ad investment advisor that um manages the 210K fund. But the 210K fund is owned by its investors, right? And um so the 210K funds uh position in Smarter Web is is owned by its investors and you know the management entity is now under a different parent company. But um but that in theory doesn't change anything about you know the the ownership and you know who owns um that position in Smarter Web. It is still owned by 210K Capitals uh investors. Um but yeah it's you know it was a cool announcement. I think it's it's an interesting development because you know as they point out rightly um it gives them the you know the second largest operating business out of any Bitcoin treasury company uh because there's a significant business there around all the Bitcoin events um that they host. Uh and yeah, you know, we'll see we'll see how that plays out for them. I know there's been some sort of um blowback about that and I and I don't fully understand the structure uh myself. Um haven't spent that much time digging into it. Um but but yeah, you know, it's a an interesting development. I I think it was kind of the plan from the beginning. Um I think they've talked about that at various points. So, and it always made sense, you know, to have an operating business attached to a Bitcoin Treasury play and and hopefully it works.

**James:**
And someone's just asked in the chat, um, let's see if I can put it on the screen. Uh, when do we expect the start of institutional investors to start investing?

**Jesse Myers:**
Uh, yeah, I mean, in some ways, there already have been institutional investors. um especially back in the the raises that that we did in late summer. Um smaller checks, you know, the yeah, you know, the sort of million pound range. Um and and a handful of them. Um and then you know we did a a significant one in uh end of October, early November I believe. Um with a few institutional investors uh and you know I think I think that if we continue to execute there will be more right. Uh that's part of what has been interesting about, you know, we did a a non-deal road show is what it's called, where you you go around and you talk to a bunch of investors. You're not you're not selling anything, but you're, you know, sort of helping educate them about the company and the general pitch. uh we did that in London when when you know on the week that we had the uplisting and and you know there's there's curiosity is I think how I would describe it um and there are also you know investors who were interested um but couldn't invest when we were on Aquis uh and and you know we had a few meetings with with those uh investors and you know they're still curious. Um, so I I think I think that's I guess a matter of time, but certainly can't um say anything, you know, definitively, but I but I think it's a matter of us continuing to execute and and then putting together some some some um book builds when there's sufficient u appetite from investors globally to get the critical mass necessary for that to make sense. Um and you know that's we we weren't able to do that for some time here um while the uplisting process was going on and now we are able to do that again though you know conditions are much tougher so you know I wouldn't expect it's nobody should expect it to be you know every couple weeks the way it was in in the summer um but it's now possible.

**James:**
Very diplomatic. Uh so you mentioned you've got some thoughts on Bitcoin going up. Um the question I was going to ask you is is what would you tell an investor who's worried about the volatility and timing uh the risk and stuff to kind of tie in Bitcoin thoughts in in that? Um what would I what would I tell people about the volatility and risk?

**Jesse Myers:**
Um well I you know that the the old refrain is still true. Uh volatility is vitality. It is just misunderstood. I think um Bitcoin has good VA. By that I mean that uh if you look at the histogram of of daily returns for Bitcoin over its lifetime, it's a bell curve. Some days negative, some days positive, but there is a fat right tail as they say. Um there's a cluster really of kind of five to 10% positive days uh and and there's not as much of that on the negative side. So what that means is a volatile day tends to be a positive day. Like if and in in Tradfi a volatile day tends to be a negative day. Um so you know when you talk to traditional investors volatility is a scary word for for mo most portfolio managers. especially ones that are, you know, sort of inherently defensive. Like a wealth manager does not like uh the word volatility. Um they want safe and, you know, low volatility because they're trying to, you know, preserve wealth. Uh but if you're trying to grow wealth, you want to be in a high volatility uh stock that skews, you know, to good. And that's what that's what Bitcoin has historically delivered. Uh, of course, it's volatility is down quite a bit in the in the recent era and that's just Bitcoin maturing as an asset. Uh, and that's where Bitcoin treasure companies are quite interesting because they amplify Bitcoin's volatility. Um, you know, there's it's call it what you want like the higher beta version of Bitcoin. you know, Bitcoin treasure companies seem to react um strongly to, you know, Bitcoin trending one way or the other. Um and and that goes into the sort of sentiment about Bitcoin treasury companies and how that evolves based on how people feel about Bitcoin at a given time. Um, but anyway, the you know, Bitcoin's all has been like 35 recently. It's a fair bit higher. Um, and Smarter Web's V has been like 100 to 120. Uh, and that's to me kind of reminiscent of like what Bitcoin's vault would have been like in probably 2013, maybe 2015. like that kind of V and you know it's broad strokes here but I think that's that's you know you that's what it takes to have the kind of performance that Bitcoin had back then is is you need that you know commensurate amount of V um so it's a great thing ultimately that a Bitcoin treasury company offers that um of course it has been very painful in the last eight months where you know that Highval uh has has has been a bare market experience where highall in a bare market is not fun. Um but highall in in a bull market is very fun and we're probably at a point where most Bitcoin treasury company investors have forgotten what that feels like. Um, and that might that might be a good thing in terms of, you know, sort of being indicative of where we are in in a sentiment cycle.

**James:**
And you sort of indicated earlier about you've got some thoughts about Bitcoin going up.

**Jesse Myers:**
Yeah. Well, yeah, I guess that's a good segue right there. Um, I don't know. I'm I I'll I'll preface by saying that I'm always too bullish about Bitcoin. Uh, and and it's something of a deliberate choice I made years ago. Um, that I I I I somebody made the point that you're better off being too bullish about Bitcoin than than than not. Um, you know, than being bearish about Bitcoin. So, and I think that's right. That certainly has proven right. So you being too bullish also help helps you to hold um during downtrends and bare markets and that has been important for for me over the last decade. Um not quite decade but yeah um so where do we find ourselves right now? It's it's very interesting that you know I'm I guess the majority I don't know first of all like I I nothing here with with certainty or clarity um but in probabilities right I I in probabilities I think it's more likely than not that that we have actually been in a bare market for the last actually 14 months for u for Bitcoin Um, and and I think it hasn't felt like that in large part because gold and silver did so well in 2025 that it that it actually kind of pulled up um Bitcoin along with gold and silver. uh even though gold and silver massively outperformed and Bitcoin, you know, looked like a a real lagard, I I think we've been in a bare market and it didn't really look or feel like it because of, you know, those forces kind of contributing. Um, yeah, so 14 months ago, I was at Michael Sailor's New Year's party. Uh and and that in hindsight was peak sentiment um about Bitcoin, about the future. 2025 was was going to be a huge year. Strategy had been running hot. Metanet had been running hot. Uh everyone was super confident that was going to continue. Um and in hindsight that, you know, that that that's that was the climate we were in at that point. um if you look at the RSI and I don't put put much stock in um indicators or you know whatever with regard to markets and especially Bitcoin um but it is interesting to look at the sort of RSI chart of Bitcoin versus gold uh and if you look at the you know weekly chart in the RSI indicator um every four years, it dips into oversold and right now is the lowest it's ever been. Uh, and the last 14 months has been a a downtrend from from overbought. You know, the last time it was overbought was was December um 2020 gosh, whatever that was. 2023 uh 2020—

**James:**
24.

**Jesse Myers:**
Yeah. 2024. Yeah. Um that was that was when it was last you know on the top of the the bands and and it's been kind of bouncing and trending down for 14 months and if you go and look back at you know the 14 months that preceded each of these bottoming points where where you know RSI reaches oversold on that chart. um 14 months of bare market, you know, of sentiment downtrend more specifically. And that's not quite perfectly aligned with bare market, but you know, you have peak enthusiasm and and then that fades and you know, it may not occur to you that you're in a bare market for most of the time, but you but turns out in hindsight you were. Um, so you know the uh I think that's probably that's possibly what has been happening uh with Bitcoin and and if you think about it that would be kind of in line I need to put a post together about this but so you're getting kind of all the half half form thoughts here but um the 2020 2017 bull market so the the Bitcoin having was like I think June 2016 and then you had 18 months before the peak.

Uh and then the next cycle so the next having was May 2020. Uh and you had um you had actually 11 months until the enthusiasm peak which you can see in in various metrics like you know like like Google searches for Bitcoin and um and RSI too like that was the enthusiasm peak right before the China mining ban in May 2021. So that was that was 10 months um post having. So you had accelerated the time frame or where the market had I think gotten excited about the having and digested you know that changed environment more quickly than it had previously. Um and in part because the the change you know is half as big of a change from uh from you know the prior having. And then if you look at the 2024 um having that was in April and we may and it sort of seems like we had sentiment peak uh December 2024. So like eight months later. So again, a quickening of um how long it took for the market to digest the impact of the having and get excited about it and and and price it in because there was a strong track record of bull markets following havingss. So you you know you you say, "Oh, okay, a having just happened. Well, I'm I'm going to get bullish now rather than let it play out slowly as it did in 2016." Um so anyway that that is increasingly how I am thinking about it that you know sentiment peak for the for the you know the 2024 having happened really quickly. Um and and of course this like overarching problem too of of uh AI investment and you know AI sucking the attention out of the room. Um I think probably contributed considerably. Meanwhile, you know, you you've got a bunch of OGs holding Bitcoin who were always going to sell at 100,000 because they've been holding for 15 years and, you know, they're 50 years old now or or whatever, 45 and and they're super rich and they want to cash out half their stack. And so I think there's a lot of that happening, too. Um, so all those things I think added up to we had a a much more muted bull market than expected and and I think a shorter one than people anticipated. Um, but anyway, fast forward to to now. I think that we may have been in a, you know, in the sentiment downtrend for 14 months already. And historically that's that's the extent of of it when you look at the this you know chart versus gold. Um so you know 12 months from now I think it's more likely than not that Bitcoin outperforms gold. Um I think it's more likely than not that you know sentiment is better than it is now. Um, and and I also think that it's quite possible that, you know, here or near here, maybe it's another quarter away, who knows, is a bare market bottom for Bitcoin, which is historically followed by three years of uptrend. Um, in which case that's a fantastic setup for for smarter web. you know, if if this is if if we manage to to, you know, live through a bare market and we're we're still making progress and relative strength in the UK is continued to grow, then, you know, we're set up in a great position to continue following the sort of metanet trajectory that that we're still in the early stages of, but it's it's all still right in front of us. I do point back to like you know the IPO for smarter web was uh in April late April last year and the sentiment peak globally for Bitcoin treasure companies uh was late June. So you had you had two months. So smarter web has enjoyed two months of like favorable conditions and managed to get you know probably at that point 2400 Bitcoin or whatever it was um maybe 2,000. Um, and obviously MetaPlanet had at that point enjoyed 15 months of good conditions and and had managed to get to like 30,000 Bitcoin because of 15 months of of good conditions for Bitcoin Treasure Company. So, you know, put all those pieces together, right? And at some point here, Bitcoin trends up and slowly with some lag, I think enthusiasm for the Bitcoin Treasury Company model creeps back in because people get excited about Bitcoin. They want more Bitcoin. And Smarter Web is in position to continue doing what it has been doing, but it's a lot slower going now. And you could, you know, follow the metaplanet trajectory in the next, you know, 12 months of of quite good conditions for Bitcoin treasure companies whenever those arrive.

**James:**
Yeah, I think I think this cycle's been pretty wild in the fact that um there's never been so much positive like thing things going on for for Bitcoin, you know, Trump getting in and the positivity that's brought potential SPR, other nation states getting involved. Um, and on top of that, we haven't had maybe yet Touchwood, um, any of the big like blowups of FTX or Luna or any of that kind of stuff. Um, and and yet we didn't get the euphoric kind of blowoff top uh for for Bitcoin. Anyway, um what are your thoughts about quantitive tightening being sort of a part of that? Um it's the first cycle that was kind of fully within a quantitive tightening uh window.

**Jesse Myers:**
Yeah, it it's a great question. Uh, I guess I've always been such a big proponent of uh the havingings and Bitcoin supply schedule being I cheekily um refer to it as the prime mover for Bitcoin um to borrow that sort of religious term but you know I I think that Bitcoin's indogenous supply schedule properties its you having of new supply issuance uh force the world to to you know process that variable as it changes over time. Um and and and the only you know assuming that demand doesn't go down by half you know that that forces the price to go up over time. And um so I've always been a you know an an acolyte of uh the havingings's importance uh and yet this cycle disappointed on that front considerably um and and that happened in in you know the first time that Bitcoin's really faced quantitative tightening conditions and also um not favorable conditions for you know the business cycle which quite related but um so you know those theories that are that that you doesn't really matter so much what the having does but instead it's all about global liquidity and and that's you know really about being in a quantitative easing environment which is good for the you know business cycle uh and all that like those theories have been out there um for a long time and didn't really hold much weight. But now they seem a lot more plausible. Um but then but then again I I I always come back to that, you know, the first principle of like well the only reason people um the only the first reason that people care about Bitcoin is that it has increasing scarcity of new supply issuance. So it's, you know, it's harder to get a unit of Bitcoin in the future than it is now. So that matters and that's the first thing that matters and then the game theory from that you know plays out too. Um, so you know, I don't know. I I think it's a good setup for I've seen a chart of you know the business cycle appears to be has has been in a you know in a tough period for a couple years and um sort of looks to be it's historically you know where where it bottoms and and you know at the same time there's all this pressure for you know switching to QE But there hasn't been any like calamity that has sort of kickstarted it um as there usually is. So we'll see. But uh if it turns out that that matters a lot and we've been in a tough climate and again and and then that happens to line up with a you know a switch to good times um that that could bode very well for Bitcoin. And then obviously smarter web is in my view because of the things we've talked through uh downstream of you know sentiment about bitcoin and importantly amplifies sentiment about bitcoin.

**James:**
Yeah I think with the um with the quantive tightening quantive easing business cycle all that kind of stuff is that if that is what causes it then it's looking pretty good for next cycle. Yeah.

**Jesse Myers:**
And and the point that I I'd make in there too is that I feel like uh um Twitter generally feels like we just started a bare market, you know, could be because because people were so bullish in Q4. Uh and we had an all-time high in Q4. you know, that was that was October that we had an all-time high of $126,000 per coin. Um, so, you know, and if you apply this the sort of historical pattern of like, okay, now we're going to have a year-long bare market and and maybe we're two months into it, that's that's pretty bleak, but but I don't think that the the sort of um sentiment metrics line up with that. It it seems like we've been in a a rough uh market and and people are being thrown off by the fact that that gold pulled us up to a new time new all-time high in October when sentiment wasn't there. Um and you know momentum for Bitcoin was was was like mid bare market kind of pattern. Uh, so anyway, I think that's I I think I'm considerably more optimistic than the average Bitcoiner on Twitter right now because I have this this view that I think we're at or near a bottom for Bitcoin rather than starting a year-long bare market.

**James:**
Okay. And I want to ask just a couple of quickfire questions and then we'll talk about I don't know events and and upcoming. So, um, quickfire. What's what's the biggest lie businesses still believe about Bitcoin? Um, so like when you're talking to investors or something like that.

**Jesse Myers:**
That's fun. Yeah. Uh, huh. I mean, all the classic m, you know, misunderstanding of Bitcoin is is still out there. So, you know, that's a full range of um of things I could I could could say, but I think the overarching thing that's still surprising to me is that that the default position continues to be that Bitcoin is just some collective Beanie Babies kind of value, you know, like like Pokemon cards or something that like people have just decided that this thing has value for no reason. And and I think that's, you know, obviously that causes a a considerable hesitation to invest in a Bitcoin treasury company. If if you are an institutional investor and you have that sort of default mentality about Bitcoin, well, you know, you can talk about how great we're doing all day, but if they don't if if they believe that your treasury is built on Pokemon cards, that's a problem. Uh, and they're not going to get over that. So there's, you know, a big educational lift necessary with most people out there, most prospective investors. Um, and again, you know, luckily that's where Bitcoin is is quite uh compelling because because of its indogenous properties is increasing scarcity over time. Bitcoin will continue to be that prime mover. Uh in my view, my my mental model of Bitcoin is that it forces uh prices to go up over time and people have to process that reality as it happens to them. You know, it doesn't it doesn't that that in my mental model of Bitcoin, it doesn't uh Bitcoin doesn't need people to believe it. It will keep doing what it's going to do uh because of its properties of increasing scarcity and and then people have to um adjust to that. So, it's it totally switches. You know, I think most most people out there think that Bitcoin needs them, you know, like like like a Ponzi scheme would. Like you would need people to keep coming in in order for it to to, you know, keep being fueled. But Bitcoin doesn't need new adopters. It just needs time to keep playing out. And I think that's part of the process of coming to Bitcoin is is understanding those mechanics and realizing that it's going to keep going up so long as as Bitcoiners who believe in it don't radically exit. Uh and and then when you make that switch of Bitcoin doesn't need me, it's going to keep going up without any new adopters necessarily like you know all else equals sort of static. uh then I want it because I want to be a part of something that goes up without relying on any inputs and it totally flips it. So, um anyway, I guess that's the the biggest m misconception that's still out there and and will be for quite some time. But luckily, the great thing about Bitcoin is that it it imposes its reality on people. It doesn't it doesn't ask it doesn't plead for people to adopt it. It will impose its supply schedule on the world and the world has to adjust.

**James:**
And then another quickfire one. Why will Bitcoin native companies win over time?

**Jesse Myers:**
Yeah, I I really got to find the the time frame for this, but um I think it was Jamie in the community uh who pointed out that it was over maybe it was this century, maybe it was over the last 10 years um that Footsie companies have averaged 6% a year returns. And then if you believe the Michael Sailor model of Bitcoin is going to go up at 29% a year for the next two decades and and and you just stop there, right? Like what's the performance of of smarter web assuming we don't add any more Bitcoin? Um and and Bitcoin does what Michael Sailor believes it it will do. Well, then that's 29% a year of price appreciation for smarter web. Meanwhile, if if you know the sort of footsy average continues into the future, you know, 6% for for other companies on the stock exchange. Um, that right there is a winning story, right? like and and and I think that's what that's what uh is so obvious to a Bitcoin treasure company investor, but um everyone else doesn't hasn't thought about is that is that if you have a treasury, if you have a balance sheet built of Bitcoin, then it will perform with Bitcoin plus whatever you can do in terms of adding Bitcoin per share. So, you know, that that's the that's the real value proposition of a Bitcoin treasure company is if you're bullish on Bitcoin, it will track Bitcoin plus, you know, you're layering on this risk that that causes it to be uncorrelated with Bitcoin and hopefully outperform Bitcoin because you're adding Bitcoin per share.

**James:**
Fantastic. Um, so tell us a little bit. I know you you've spoken about events and stuff, but tell us what events are coming up. Is it strategy world next week?

**Jesse Myers:**
Yes, it is strategy world next week. Um, uh, Sailor has invited Andrew uh to to speak on and andrew uh roped me into that which I'm looking forward to. So, we will we will be uh I think we've got like a 15 minute time slot. we will be speaking about smarter web and the UK um as a as a market for a bitcoin treasure company. Um so quite excited about that. Uh Sailor has also very kindly um invited us to um you know a dinner um where you know who knows who else is there. I think a curated set of uh individuals. So looking forward to that. Um, I think that alone speaks to, you know, sailor's opinion of Smarter Web and especially of Andrew. Um, and I think that's uh quite a significant I I mean, literally the most important stamp of approval you could you could hope for in the world, I think. So, you know, if Sailor's right um about things, as I think he generally is, then um that's a good sign. Um so, yeah, that's that's next week. And then the next event will be the AGM um in Bristol in March, mid-March. Uh, and then in May, we have the um the Bitcoin unconference UK coming up at at May 29th. You can get tickets on on the website. Um, very much looking forward to that. uh looks like we will have the CEOs from you know a handful of the the biggest Bitcoin treasure companies in the world including strategy um speaking and so that you know that was a great event the first edition was a great event in New York City in October um and very much looking forward to having the second installment be in the UK the the second most important financial center in the world.

**James:**
I think that's your your favourite stat at the moment.

**Jesse Myers:**
Well, you'll see why. I mean, I I put I put together I put together the the analysis of uh you know what the global asset landscape chart but for the UK. Um and sneak peek it's it's 6% 6% of of global assets uh is commanded by the UK. That doesn't necessarily mean owned by UK individuals or entities, but um doiciled in in the UK basically um or or or held by UK individuals or entities. So um that that's significant that you know the in the course of doing that research I've found out that uh in terms of like financial plumbing so the sort of amorphous umbrella um description of of capital intermediation which is which is kind of equivalent to financial plumbing. uh the UK has like 20 25% market share of like all the financial plumbing in the world including 40% of all foreign exchange volume um so currency trading and 90% of of global interest rate swaps uh occur through London clearing house um so you know all these like exotic um financial activities and and you know being the the preferred banking destination for half the world really you know the developing world in particular um that's that's where the gold is stored that's where the the bank deposits are held and and that is uh very good for um yeah that's very good for a potential future where you're trying to understand how much capital is within a regulatory regime that might be interested in a preferred equity instrument.

**James:**
Awesome. Yeah, I'm really looking forward to the unconference. Um the lineup looks amazing. Um I kind of wish it was May already to be honest, but—

**Jesse Myers:**
Well, the weather will do that to you, too, huh?

**James:**
Yeah. Well, maybe you're going to get to enjoy that soon, too.

**Jesse Myers:**
Yes.

**James:**
Um thank you very much, Jesse. Um we we kind of gone over the hour, but um really appreciate you taking the time to talk to me today and I hope it's been useful to the investors and people watching at home.

**Jesse Myers:**
Yes. Look forward to next time. Thanks, James.

**James:**
Yeah.
