**Anders:**
(0:00:00) Good evening from Copenhagen, Denmark, and welcome to a new name of this show. This is not, this is no longer Smarter Web Wednesdays. This is actually, Andrew, I'm not sure if you're aware of it, this is the fourth episode of Smarter Webly Wednesdays. All thanks to you. Um, welcome to the show. Welcome to the audience. Full disclaimer, I started with a tiny bag which is the whole reason why this show started. Um, I wanted to discover more. People were pushing me like do that. And then Thursday I kind of tripled down. Friday I doubled down on my triple down. And today I got a little bit more. Granted my portfolio is very small compared to some of the screenshots I've seen. But here we are with the faster horse in the race, Mr. Andrew Webley himself. Good to see you again, Andrew. Thank you for being back. How's it going?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:00:55) Yeah, it's pretty good actually at the moment. You know, we've been pretty busy today. Um, you know, every day is quite busy. Um, but you know, another good day, I think. Um, yeah, we've got a few more things that we need to get done today and then, you know, we've got a very busy day in London tomorrow, which I'm quite looking forward to. Um, so yeah, it's going okay. It's going okay, as you say.

**Anders:**
(0:01:20) How are you doing— let me add further to that preface of where we are. We spoke two weeks ago when I was sitting in Prague working at BTC Prague. Um, your, uh, the community size on X of SWC investors has grown 50%. And the Bitcoin on your balance sheet has grown 50%. 50%, Andrew, is a lot in two weeks. What is going on? What are you doing? How are you the faster horse?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:01:50) Well, we're just sticking to the strategy really. So, um, you know, I haven't been on X much today because, you know, I've been so busy with various different tasks, but when I did look first thing today, it was almost at 3,000 um people in the community, which is really cool. Um, and you're right, the Bitcoin has grown. Um, last week, um, we did our biggest fundraise to date. Um, you know, over £40 million pounds in a couple of hours. That was quite cool. Um, especially as earlier in the week we had one single strategic investor who um invested um you know a smaller amount but still a significant amount of money. Um, so you know, last week when you add the two figures together, you're talking um you know somewhere around about £44 million pounds, a little bit more in fact.

Um, so you know, we do have plenty of capital. Um, and when we announced our Bitcoin buy earlier this week, we also started showing people the capital because, you know, I'm very keen that everyone can understand everything that we're doing. And that's um in a small way what we're, you know, trying to get released later today as well, actually. Um, which I think people will like. I hope they'll like it anyway.

Um, so what we decided to do is to start, when we announced our Bitcoin purchases, to very clearly approximate the cash that we've got in our treasury for Bitcoin purchases. So we did that as well this week which I think everyone liked seeing. Um, so yeah, you know, it's definitely heading in the right direction.

**Anders:**
(0:03:25) Yeah, I um, it very much is. And, uh, wait, let me put it back on the other setting there. Um, because you're touching upon something that I know, uh, like some of my friends that also bought into SWC because like I can't be quiet. Let me speak nicely. I can't be quiet if I see something that I think is good, um, good for them, good for humanity, good for Bitcoin. And SWC is one of those things I do believe.

Um, and the question that I'm getting is, um, so you raise capital and then it, you know, that is sizable on your balance sheet and it may take like a week or two or something for you guys to deploy that. And right here I have, um, from the smartinvestmentguy.com, one of your community members, where he has shown, so people understand that the net asset value of your company not only is the Bitcoin but also the cash because that's going to be deployed to Bitcoin. Do you want to attach any words to that?

I think, ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be a test because Andrew just dropped off. I'm sorry. It's— Andrew is back. Um, I lost you.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:04:30) You did? Uh, it felt like I lost you, Andrew, but anyways, here we are.

**Anders:**
(0:04:35) Yeah, very quick reconnect. Go ahead.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:04:38) Yeah, well, I've got three internet connections actually, so I'm quite fortunate in that regard. So, um, you know, I tend to sort of like change them as things change. Yeah. Um, so yeah, when we were looking there, the thing that I was looking at when the screen went was the, um, you know, if you add the cash that we've got and the Bitcoin that we've got within our treasury, it's quite, um, yeah, it's quite— well, everyone can see what it means, can't they?

**Anders:**
(0:05:05) Yeah, I guess so. And I think it's really good that the cash that is going dollar for dollar— well, not dollar for dollar, pound for pound— into Bitcoin, of course, is accounted for in net asset values. Um, and it is on this website. And you are now communicating that clearly, transparently, which you have a history of in your press releases.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:05:28) Yeah. It's just— to give you the reason why we did it, I saw some figures before and they were a few million pounds lower than we actually have got. Um, and we work really hard to raise the capital and a lot of that capital is raised, um, you know, with quite low rates of commission, um, none in some cases. Um, so I wanted to try and share that as transparently as I could so that people realize that, you know, we are working really hard on getting really good capital on really good terms. Um, because, you know, that's an important part of the model and you've got to look at every little detail in the model for that model to be great as a whole. Um, so that's why I wanted to share that figure.

**Anders:**
(0:06:10) Absolutely. Um, and I think that, you know, it gives investors more clarity. Um, let me bring this back in a second. It gives more knowledge about exactly where you are in the game plan. And, um, if I may ask you the question, so when you raise funds, you don't buy immediately same day or the next day. You spread it out over a week or two. Is that something you can explain to us?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:06:40) Yeah. So when we started, um, I felt that the right approach— and it had nothing to do with like trying to smooth out any figures or anything. It was literally what I thought the right approach was and I still think it's the right approach for us. Um, so I decided that we would deploy capital that was held in our treasury into Bitcoin in a short time period but not all in one day. Um, so a short time period is probably around about two weeks in the context of what we're talking about.

Um, so you know, it's very important to realize what our understanding and our ethos is— that, you know, I personally don't believe in the pound, the dollar, the euro, whatever. Um, I believe in Bitcoin. Um, and because of that, that's why the company has this treasury policy. So, we're not saying that we want to hold, you know, 10 million pounds cash for the next six months or anything like that. That would be ridiculous. Um, in my opinion.

Um, what we're saying is that we don't want to put it all in one day because when you're a smaller company like us, you need to exercise a bit of caution with the volatility of the asset. Now, at the moment, Bitcoin isn't very volatile. It's probably got a vol of like half a percent or something like that. Um, so it's actually incredibly unvolatile at the moment. But, you know, things do happen. Um, and when you're trying to build a big business for the long term, you know, the worst thing that could happen is you've allocated all your capital to Bitcoin and then it drops 20%. Because the reality there is that it might be very difficult to raise money for a month and a half, two months or something like that.

So, you know, two weeks isn't a long time. You know, it's not as quick as one day, obviously. Um, but it's the approach that we've done from the outset and it's an approach that I believe in longer term. Um, you know, as the treasury grows, that additional capital may go in much quicker, but at the moment, we'll stick to the plan. Um, you know, which is working.

**Anders:**
(0:08:35) So far it certainly is working, Andrew. Um, and that's why I personally invested more. Um, and I guess what you're describing, to me, it essentially reduces downside to the stock if you don't put in all the cash immediately, but you buy some and then you spread it out over two weeks maybe, because if Bitcoin goes down and all the Bitcoin accumulating companies also move down, um, then— and sometimes faster because of the way it's built up and you're paying a premium to the Bitcoin— but then if you have cash on hand to buy at lower prices, it kind of reduces your downside. And if you have a high MNAV and the Bitcoin starts running up, it's kind of like a positive problem. Um, so it's— I mean, I personally, I appreciate that. I think it makes sense for sure.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:09:25) If I can just share here quickly. So again, this is on the website, the smartinvestmentguy.com. It's bitcoinbtc2 on X that is putting this website together. It is not live update. It's not real time. It is MNAV updated once daily. Um, but if you're looking here at the white line, it's the MNAV— the MNAV, I said— it's developed since you guys went online or IPO'd. Um, and then the orange is the price.

Um, and so Thursday last week it really got historically cheap. It was the cheapest multiple to net asset value since you guys went public, the first week after you went public. Um, and that's why I added more of this. And it may be, you know, maybe it's wrong, but I think that these things will oscillate higher again.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:10:15) So, well, I wanted to talk about that graph actually, funnily enough. Um, I wanted to talk about that graph, funnily enough, because it's a really good way for people to see what we've been doing historically as a business and then the opportunity.

So, um, you know, last week, um, you know, I bought more shares as well on Thursday and Friday. Um, all disclosed to the market as obviously you have to do as a director. Um, and you know, it was fascinating to see, really, um, you know, after our biggest raise to date, um, which effectively lowers the MNAV overnight. So you would expect the price, you know, all other things being equal, to actually move up, not down. Um, and it was, yeah, it was fascinating to see actually.

But I completely agree. Um, you know, when I was looking at my spreadsheet, um, before I checked it on Nick's website, um, to see the line. And then Jesse, who works with us, shared some charts as well, which illustrate exactly the same thing. And you're right, it's basically— if you're interested in MNAV as a metric, which most of us are— it was looking as cheap as it's been for, you know, since the start really.

**Anders:**
(0:11:20) Um, since the market kind of realized what you were doing about one week in, it's the cheapest. Um, so attractive in my opinion, not financial advice.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:11:30) Yeah. Yeah. Same here, you know, in my opinion. Yeah. Um, so, I obviously, you know, believe in that opinion incredibly because, you know, I own a lot of shares in the company and it's very, very important to me. Um, and I spent the best part of £100,000 on stock in the market um last week because, you know, I thought it was a great opportunity.

I actually said to my wife, we've got this cash in some of our accounts and I can't actually think of a better company than our company. And it's just unfortunate that we've got a load of it anyway because, you know, it doesn't spread the risk. But you know, what can you do?

**Anders:**
(0:12:05) Yeah, what can you do? Um, because I guess you kind of know what's going on and you're feeling comfortable with the management, Andrew.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:12:12) Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think they're doing okay. They're doing okay.

**Anders:**
(0:12:18) Good. Um, so overall, I personally as an investor, I look at MNAV which we just spoke about, and I also look at, well, how fast is the company accumulating more Bitcoin per share. At the moment your days to cover is one of the fastest, and that's I guess why the community is calling you the faster horse in the race. Right now I think it's around 30 days, maybe 39, I don't know, but—

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:12:45) I'll tell you the thing that I look at as well, if you want, which is quite interesting I think. So I look at all of those same things, but then I also think what else is the management doing that can increase the exposure of the company, i.e. the liquidity. Um, because if you think about things like our, you know, ATM style thing that we've got, um, you know, the more liquidity you've got, the more beneficial that is to then grow the company further from there.

So, that's one of the reasons why I like MetaPlanet so much. You know, their execution is unbelievable. Um, and that's because they've got liquidity and that's because they make sure that they are, you know, out and about in all the different places. Um, you know, to sort of grow that, you know, it's marketing, I suppose, you know, it's communicating, showing the world that you exist.

Um, and that's one of the reasons why we do a lot of things like, um, like this week, we were able to tell people that we had the German line of stock to make it easier for European investors. Um, and lots of these things, you know. So tomorrow morning I'm going on the TV, for example. Um, and that's all about, you know, reaching out to people that wouldn't know that these sorts of companies exist and things.

So that's the thing that I look at alongside, because otherwise what you've got is a position where those companies aren't growing. And if they're not growing in terms of marketing, then it's harder for them to maintain that growth in terms of capital, which is clearly quite an important part of the model.

**Anders:**
(0:14:10) No, absolutely. But also, Andrew, I actually— regarding like raising capital and everything, where the ATM-like thing at this point or raising privately is so crucial. Um, in just this short time, you're available for investors on the— well, not the London, but Aquis in UK, over the counter in US where I'm buying through Fidelity. Um, the Stock Taker was spoken about earlier. I'll just throw that on the screen quickly. But now also you're in Frankfurt. So tell us what's going on in Germany.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:14:45) Well, it's— I'll say it in English because I can't actually speak much German. Um, but it's all about just making the access easier for people that want to invest in the company. Um, so we get emails all the time from— I get a lot from Asia actually, which is one of my next tasks to sort out. Um, and investors want to share the journey with us all. Um, and so it's my job to try and make it easier for them to access the stock.

Um, and that really is the reason behind the Frankfurt line that we've got, to make it easier for people across Europe. Um, you know, one of our institutional investors was very, very pleased um when I told them that we had managed to get that completed so quickly as well. Um, you know, and it's just making it easier for people to get involved really. And then from the company's point of view, that's just everything that adds to the liquidity. That's what it's all about.

**Anders:**
(0:15:40) So this happened just— was it yesterday?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:15:45) Um, Monday. Was it Monday?

**Anders:**
(0:15:48) Monday. Okay. So you had three trading days in Germany. And what are you experiencing there?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:15:55) Yeah. So I've been flat out today. So I haven't actually checked today, but I had a call from the people that set that up for us earlier today. Um, and they confirmed my understanding which was the second day was better than the first. I'm yet to check the third day.

Um, but it's a bit like in the US and in the UK when a new stock becomes available, it does take a little bit of time for the various different brokers to switch it on. Um, so I would say within, you know, like the first week, you know, then most of the platforms or many of the platforms would start to have it available. Um, and you've obviously got teething problems as well. You know, for example, how they're setting the trades and things.

So, we've been working with them on that side of things, and looking at my emails this afternoon, I think that's all been sorted out as well. Um, you know, so that they can make that market. Um, because that's the other thing that people don't necessarily see. And that's the work that we do with the various different market making functions in the different markets to allow them to have the confidence to make the markets, which then lowers the spreads, um, you know, and therefore improves liquidity as well.

So, yeah, I think, you know, next couple of days and then it'll be bedded in a little bit and then hopefully we'll see that improve, um, just like we've seen the volumes, you know, sort of get slightly better in other territories.

**Anders:**
(0:17:15) Yeah. Um, and where you are now with Bitcoin and cash. So you have— was it 750 Bitcoin?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:17:25) It's above 700. 740. Yeah, it's about, um, 770, I think, was the announcement.

**Anders:**
(0:17:32) Okay. Yeah.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:17:35) The announcement was— I have to make sure I say the right line here— 773.58 was the announcement. Total Bitcoin held.

**Anders:**
(0:17:45) So, is this relatively correct that combined with cash that we know is going into Bitcoin, we're talking ballpark 1,260, this is from the website, that top line?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:17:58) Yeah. Yeah. It's a ballpark to the extent you can say. Yeah. It's ballpark accurate. Um, which is good because, you know, the line that we're very, very focused on right now is getting past a thousand, and it's— you know, everyone knows that we're as good as past that line, you know. And then, you know, if you think about it, 1,250, let's call it, um, which I'm not saying is the number, but that's the number roughly that was on the screen— um, you know, that's a quarter of the way to 2,000 or almost a quarter of the way to 2,100, um, which is, you know, the next milestone. So, you know, it really is, um, yeah, it really is, you know, going on a good trajectory.

**Anders:**
(0:18:40) It certainly is. Andrew, and so Asia— what you're telling us with Asia is that would be the next market where you would try to get listed and be accessible for clients?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:18:52) Yeah. So, you don't have to necessarily do a full listing. Um, so, we're explore— I think all I'm allowed to say is we're exploring options to make it more accessible to investors in Asia, for example. Um, you know, and we'll continue to do that because, you know, we're all about continuous improvement and— but yeah, I, um, I can't— I'm not at the stage, even if I was allowed to say it, I'm not at the stage where I could confidently promise someone that we can get access in a particular market. Um, but we're, you know, we are making good progress on what we have to do on that.

**Anders:**
(0:19:30) Yeah, absolutely. And I want to tell the audience, well, first of all, thank you very much for watching. Appreciate you all. And Andrew, I know, has some tasks to take care of and it's in all of our interest. Then, instead of— as much as we want to watch Andrew, we first and foremost want him to be the fastest jockey on the fastest horse and actually get work done. So Andrew has more work to get done today. Um, so we— you know, we got two minutes left. Um, so I want to ask you one question and then whatever final thoughts you have. And just thank you again, Andrew, for being on. Hope we can do this again in two weeks' time or so.

But the question I'm thinking is, apart from all the financial things we're talking about and how you're accumulating at a very fast pace, what is the funnest part as a person to be part of this? Because so many things are happening in your life now personally, professionally— like, what is the unexpected, like, coolest thing or nice thing that you experience? Is it a sense of purpose? Is it, you know, what—

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:20:35) I think the thing that I wasn't expecting with all of this was the nice messages that I've had from people where, you know, they've taken the decision to invest in our stock and then that's had a very positive consequence on their life. Um, you know, they've taken the risk at the end of the day. Um, you know, to do that, you know, I've just done my job, that's all.

Um, but I wasn't expecting that side of things and that's been, you know, amazing. Um, to see that side of things. Um, because, you know, we're on this mission to build a very, very big company and to do everything that everyone knows about. Um, and we need everyone's support and we want everyone's support.

Um, but then that wasn't the focus. The focus was to have something that I could invest in, that other people could invest in. And but I never really thought about what that meant, you know, um, you know, in terms of, you know, someone getting enough money to go on a holiday or to buy a new car or to pay their mortgage off or anything like that. I never actually thought about that side of things. And, um, and it's really cool to see that. Really, really cool.

**Anders:**
(0:21:45) I can only imagine. Thank you so much for that, Andrew. We all want to let you actually go back and jockey that fastest horse. Is there anything you want to add or just— again, thank you for being here. I really appreciate it and I hope to see you again in two weeks if you're down for that. But anything you want to add before we go?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:22:05) Yeah, just to apologize that I've got to dash off because, you know, we've got a bit more work that we need to get done today. It's something that I want to get live on our website today. Um, you know, I don't want it to be a tomorrow job. Um, so I'm currently incredibly focused on that. It's almost there. There's just one little bit of it that needs to be done and I have to check that.

Um, and then, you know, I think tomorrow should be quite an interesting day. You know, I think some people are coming to this event in the afternoon in London. Um, so I hope to meet some people there and, um, you know, we'll just do our best to keep on doing what we're doing.

Um, and, you know, next time in, let's say, two weeks, we'll try and make it the full hour because I feel that I've cheated you a little bit of the time here, but I'm grateful that you understand.

**Anders:**
(0:22:50) Andrew, I want you to just win the race. So, by all means. But I appreciate the time and I want you to associate coming on Smarter Webley Wednesdays, which is kind of tailor-made to you, a positive thing. So, it's all good. Thank you so much. And, um, I wish I could be there tomorrow in London. Honestly, I was in Vegas. I didn't meet you.

I have Alexander Leay from Block, the Blockchain Group, on tomorrow for anyone who's interested in that. That will be 6 PM. I think similar time actually. Yeah. Anyways, it's tomorrow on this channel. Andrew, thank you so much. And go knock it out the ballpark.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:23:25) Thank you. See you soon.

**Anders:**
(0:23:28) All right. Cheers. Bye.
