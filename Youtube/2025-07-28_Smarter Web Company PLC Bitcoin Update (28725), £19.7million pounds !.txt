**Vostra:**
(0:00:00) Hello everybody, Vostra here. The smarter web company continues continues its Bitcoin purchasing cash raising game. Welcome to the daily updates or pretty much daily updates. We had a bit of action. Hope the weekend was good. Let's do share price. The announcement of course from this morning£19.7 million from the ATM that had us surprised. We'll do the model update, the review, do some X commentary. Let's get straight into the close price. Today, 28th of July, the Smarter Web Company has closed trading. Let's refresh. There we go. A bid price of 240 on the 28th of July. And yes, everybody, the RNS this morning, £19.7 million was raised. This, if you all recall, was through the ATM type facility that Smarter Web Company has in play with Shard. What that enables the business to do is sell shares in the market on up days. Now, this had been active in the background. 14 million shares had been placed out there. We were under the assumption that this could only be completed if the full 14 million shares were sold. Now, given the market activity over the last few weeks, that has taken a bit longer than one would have liked and that's uh that's fine. That's natural. So, we in our model had thought when would that be coming in? We did not anticipate that this would be called in earlier and that that was available to do that. So as you can see the proceeds of the 6 million shares 19.7 million they were sold at approximately £325. This was clearly when the MNAVs were awarding that premium. Um the company receives 97% 3% are the fees. uh the shares were placed in line with the agreement over a 3-week period. There you go. 7th to the 25th. So, it took three weeks approximately to get to that level. Um, and the company has decided that an update every 2 weeks from this announcement would be helpful for shareholders and enable the company to receive funds earlier and therefore the company can now intends to announce subscription proceeds accordingly. It is also expected that once the current branch is complete the whole 14 million a new subscription agreement will be signed. So this is indication confirmation that the ATM will be continuing as expected and that's amazing. So this is now every two weeks we can expect money's coming in. So that's an amazing development £325. We've closed the share price today. Let's go across to our model. See what all of this is doing and trying to make sense of this world.

(0:03:00) So here we've modeled in the 28th of July, the uh 19.7 million, the increase in shares. And guess what? That takes us to total BTC if everything was being smash bought to over 2,000 bitcoins. Over 2,000 bitcoins. This is just felt like yesterday. It all started 2,000 bitcoins and over 180 million pounds of net assets. The uh business is trading at close of play today at about 3.4 on the MNAV at 240. There we can see if we move across the increase in shares so far with the 6 million now fully paid for equates to about 2.4%. and just scroll across with that and the bitcoin assuming everything gets translated into bitcoin. The way I've done my model here is sort of a forward basis if you like um assuming everything gets flushed through and that would give you a increase in sats per share from the prior raise of about 9.6%. So we've gone from 730 sats per share to 800. That's amazing. That is beautiful accretion. That is accretion in play. That is capital efficiency. This is what we talk about every day here on this channel. Do you have a capital plan? I think the smarter web company seems to have a capital plan. Look at this track record. This is just I mean I'm lost for words even replaying this now. Look at that. This is just like a a beautiful ex acceleration. We've got lots of graphs. I I like what looking at these just seeing the numbers tick up. Um that sort of gets you to a 70 p net asset value per share and you can see how that's been increasing. Lovely. Beautiful.

(0:05:00) Let's let's see what else I can show you here. My beautiful spreadsheet. 94 days since the start of the game total raised of 173 million. It's 173 million daily raises about 1.8 million pounds as now and that if you just put that into Bitcoin perspective is just over 22 bitcoins per day being bought. That's the run rate. 22.9 bitcoins per day. Um, brilliant. This is just amazing to see develop. The next tranch there would be the remainder of the 7.9 million which would take it up to the 14 million total shares. Currently they can only be sold on up days. Today was the ATM was very much active as it was an up day. Remember only 20% of the volume can be sold. So the rest this would if it's trading at about this price we can expect another 19 million pounds to come in. Will that come in? When will that come in? It depends. It depends on the trading. Um that could take a while to come in still. A week maybe two. Let's see. Let's see how that develops. But if that were to then add to all of the previous raises this month, that would take the business to just shy of 90 million pounds, that would compare with the previous month of 88 million approximately. So that's not a bad place to be. No, not a bad place at all to be. Uh will will Mr. Webly surprise us with another cheeky fund raise between now and the end of the month. Let's see. I mean, you cannot rule anything out now. We did not expect this ATM to be pulled in so early. So, I mean, I would we would all like to see one another another book build or another placement.

(0:07:30) Um, let me take you across to the some comments from our ex community here. We've updated the model. We've done the review. We've done We've seen its accretive. Highly accretive. We've seen that. That's a excellent capital efficiency there. I wanted to bring your attention to um Ollie Perry in the community. Give Ollie a follow. Ollie's done a a a brilliant analysis here on uh the um the raises, the MNAVs and the frequency of the raising. Let's take a look at this, the capital raised. He's done a 10day rolling average. So, you can see how this is moving across and then you can there was a peak. The peak coincided with the market conditions um came down and now we're here. We would I would want this to tick back up. Let's uh let's look at the the raises. As you can see, raise 9 10. It's building back up. Beautiful graphs. MNAVs. Yeah, look at this. Is the the game. The MNAVs are coming down. So, that has an impact naturally on the amounts being raised and the frequency. days since previous raises. You can see the activity continuing the 10 to 12 day mark. No, no more than 12 days goes by. Maybe 13. There's always something happening. This is so key. Uh what does Ollie say? Looking into the only three things that matter in the business. Raise amount. Yes, it's coming off its high. It looks slightly under pressure because of the market sentiment. Supplementary book build need this week to support that wouldn't go a miss. That would be really good. MNAV at raise. Yep, that makes sense. It was five corresponds to the what we've checked here. The 19.7 million at the£325 was approximately averaging about five on the MNAV. Um let's see frequency of rays. We just talked about that. Good stuff. Good stuff. Jesse Myers, what does he say? I like your three points. I'd add that the raise amount does correlate with sentiment, too. That sense a healthy and growing BTCTC would see higher highs and higher lows with raise amounts over time. The key is to just keep moving forward. Keep moving forward.

(0:10:30) Let's look at the graphs. So, let's look at the Trading View charts. Keep moving forward. You can see the price came down over the last week trading at one point at 1 80 even. It got to 1.70. Did anybody get those dips? It's now moving across to the 240 above. Can we get back up to the 0618 to the 290 level? It does not take much. As we've said before, if a book build were to happen, it can happen. We can go back to our previous raises. 295 was the last book. 290, the one before that, we're at 240. Does not take anything at all to move this stock in the last few minutes of play. In fact, if I go back to some of the trading activity, let's check through trading activity today. You can see some of the trades coming through. 10,000 15,000. Yes, there's cells on the sell side. 20,000 190,000 25,000 25,000. This is the buy side. 25,000 5,000 25 20 10 10 25 These round number clips to me look like positioning in people. These look like positioning in people and that's when liquidity gets built, floors get built. So this is very interesting to see. Let's go. Let's go.

(0:12:30) Right, moving across. X comments. So, that was great. Give Olly Perry a shout out everybody. Olly Perry's numbers are very aligned with the work we've got in the model and it makes sense. He's exploring the future of money, Bitcoin. Formerly a partner in management consulting. That makes sense. Specializes in tech and telecoms. He knows a thing or two. Everybody, let's go. Right. Moving across X comments. What else is happening in the X world? David Reid, pleased to announce that the Smarter Web shares are now available on Best Invest. Okay, that's good. Yeah, no financial advice. Never any financial advice on these channels. It's all financial entertainment. John Thor saying, "Andrew speaking at the inaugural Bitcoin Treasuries NYC conference." Oh, wow. Amazing. That's the a new conference. Hey, these conferences are picking up. Is anyone going? Drop a comment. Let me know if you're going. Why is the trading volume of TSWC so low? People are on holiday, I guess. Should we go to the United States for a road show? Oh, and also the Middle East. Why not? Let's go everywhere. Dr. Bitcoin repo reposting this. I'm going to do a separate video on this ATM. I did let Mr. Bitcoin know. Dr. Bitcoin know I was doing this. This is really excellent graphs and charts and explanations on how the ATM and the book build and the differences work. Excellent. Ragnar, give Ragnar a follow. Everyone, we did an interview with Ragnar. He's got the Ragnar Treasury going 600,000 SWC shares. John, highly recommending Micro to Macro. Scottish Mick. Yes, let's get the USA going. Make sure you catch the Ragna says Vostra. Simon hater enjoying today. Jamie Smarter quality. Excellent stuff. Yeah, the vibe is picking up. The vibe is picking up. Let's go.
