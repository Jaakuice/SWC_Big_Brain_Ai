**Wra:**
(0:00:00) Hello, Wra here. Hope everyone had a good day. If you're new to the channel, we do a daily share price update here. Check the price at close. We update the financial model. Do a bit of Q&A. I forgot to write the second agenda point, but depends on what's going on. We'll do a bit of uh on this one. Let's just take a look at what's happening in the um the X community. Cool. With that, let's check the share price. I know a few of you was mentioning yesterday about the pricing I was taking. So, I was making sure today that we get Aquis loaded properly. So, let's flick across to Aquis, the website where we're checking the close price. Here it is. And then we shall take the bid price, right? £360. So, the market's closed at £360 after a uh exuberant wouldn't say exuberant after a a fire day yesterday. And now you're thinking what why doesn't that continue? Well, let let's let's break this down as we do.

(0:01:00) Firstly, I want to go across to the financial model to see what MNAV this is um now uh hovering about. And as you can see, it's just just approximately I'll zoom this out as well because starting to realize when I watch these back on my mobile that this is probably I don't even know if half of you look at these numbers on the screen. So, I'm going to voice them out. Um my by my calculations, we have got uh MNAV closing MNAV trading of approximately just over 6.6. six. Um, yesterday we had the uh announcement of the subscription that raised 10.3 million pounds. And a video went out earlier today where I talk about sort of some of the intraday uh price action that we see and how sometimes it's good to just take a step back and and see the overall picture. look at the structure. Are there any major alarm bells ringing from that perspective?

(0:02:00) Um, we can just take a look at that now. I Here we go. This is the SWC chart for uh today Trading View. As always, the pricing doesn't update um straight away. So on this it shows £3.74, but we've clearly seen the close there just before. Nevertheless, you can still see that we are bouncing just under the 0.382 um line. Um and the 0.5, which is the 3.54 seems to be protecting it reasonably well. Um, if you if you ask me, I think the the 0618 they call the golden pocket that's we're well clear of that. That was 2.90. Um, £3.54 blasted through that. Um, I suspect as soon as it starts hovering above the or approaching the £419 mark that you could see a quite a a bullish spike through there. Um, that's what I think could happen.

(0:03:00) Uh, let's have a quick look at the US chart while it's uh live in play. There we go. On the US chart, we are bouncing around the 0618 currently and that is at a share price of just uh $5 approximately. So very interested to see what happens um closing the week, but I'd say this is going into the um right direction still. Um the three the European the uh this is the Frankfurt chart. There's not a lot of volume I think still coming through. So, it's hard to tell how that is um measuring through, but seems to be going in the right direction. I I mainly look at the the GBP and the USD, but you can see that the other um companies also. So, we're also tracking MetPanet that's just got off your screen there, but that's down currently 4%. The old BG group down 3% currently showing. So it seems to be a sectorwide flatness. I'd say I wouldn't even say this is this is just what could we say little bit of profit taking along the way.

(0:04:00) Um have the is there a little bit of shorting for the old BGS guys on Aquis? It's not so easy to do. We're I'm I'm learning. Um, but yeah, so I there's there's uh all every time people run through a bit of a runup like that and you come slightly down, you just got to be patient, right? Going back to the model and this is why I have a live model running in the background because I can can tell that the activity the the direction and as long as the book builds are happening the yield is building um the sats per share is increasing you can see the mnavs yeah all good it's going back to the share so that's the share price update.

(0:05:00) Let's um flick now very quickly to the X community. See what's going on there. Jesse Meyers recording a podcast with Brank. Have a look at that. Sign up, subscribe. Um what will he be talking about? There should be a fun fun angle since there's a lots of misconceptions I can help clear up. Yeah, Jesse can help clear up lots of misconceptions on the criticisms of investing in BTC treasury companies. That'll be in a two weeks time at Zinc. What else is going on? Did I free up a little dry prow? But yeah, buy the dips. Uh Zinc, what's Zinc saying? Let's talk fellow shareholders. UTXO involvement in another UK. Yeah, I I heard about this. What What are you guys thinking? um Satsuma UTXO potentially or have they invested in that? Somebody asked me as well and I was like again competition is is is good competition is is is fine. I mean there's more to be potentially learned about that so not quite sure.

(0:06:00) Um, but as we always keep saying, execution, right, you can have the same people back in the same different teams, but what we're seeing here is is something that um I'm Yeah, I'm wondering if other other companies can replicate at at scale. We've also seen how um the businesses when they start off smaller, they tend to um gavven a lot more retail support, momentum, energy, mnav, fuel, whatever you want to call it. Uh retail matters, right? If you're building a book um directly privately with with without that happening, yes, you you'll start off with the the bigger institutional sizes and and get get I don't know how much how much it is exactly, but you you'll start off on the blocks with a lot more Bitcoin, but jury is still out on whether that model is um as effective as as what we've witnessed here and will continue to witness. So, be more interesting to see what happens there.

(0:07:00) Um, cool. Let's go straight to your questions and comments. I see quite a few coming through. Thank you very much for those. Keep them coming through. Um, start at the bottom. Andy Smith, another informative video, mate. Thank you very much. This was the Jesse Meers was right about Bitcoin treasuries and what everyone misses. Yeah, MNAV valuations. If you haven't seen that video, check it out. It's uh got a lot of good knowledge in there about um how you value these businesses. Um and to bring it back to the point of just uh what we what Zinx was talking about there, like how how do you how do you map those MNAVs up to um slightly larger well businesses that are are starting on um the bigger exchanges? It's it's not Let's see. Let's see. I'm not sure.

(0:08:00) Um, Timmy Adamson 279. Love it. Vostra with the orange heart. Cheers. I'm I'm enjoying the love that you all guys all throwing this way. Right, next. Let's go. Chris Pink 8712. Let's go. Hey, production getting an uplift with the share price. This is to do with yesterday's share price. So, I was just playing around with um something there in the uh in the beginning um on that uh video, but yeah, let's see. Top marks for these updates. The wise are watching and accumulating SWC. I'm one of them. Diamond hands definitely. What's next? Did you see Jesse's prediction on SWC? I'm pretty convinced S SWC TSOC will hit $3550 before SA. What is your thoughts? Yeah, could do like what? Check out tomorrow's video as well. I'm trying to model or understand potential impacts of BTC ripping up as we've seen new all-time high this week. So, let's factor those things in. I haven't I I'll try and double check this um Jesse's prediction. I can't can't recall. Jesse has really got behind the stocks. Yeah, he has. He's invested in in the business as well by the way if you guys um didn't know that uh when I come around too. Love the videos. Keep it up. Thank you. We'll do. Yeah. Thank you, Vos. Incredible insight and brilliant videos. You are a godsend. Oh god. I think Andrew is the godsend around here, right? With what he's doing with SWC. We're just the the messengers.

(0:10:00) Awesome content. Wostradamus. Yeah, that's picking up this Wastradamas thing. What would you say is the approximate minimum capital injection of criy? What what capital injection into QUP that would make it financially viable? Cuneup. I had a quick look. This is you're talking about qualifying um uh overseas pensions, right? Uh no pensions advice here. Um so sorry. Um, is your spreadsheet shared somewhere so we can reference it outside your videos? I couldn't find it linked in the YouTube videos or on X. Thanks for your Yeah, there is the um I might not have linked it everywhere actually. I need to update some of the descriptions, but uh let me try that and and then check back. Thanks for your comment and thanks for reviewing.

(0:11:00) 30th like, great stuff, Midwest Cannabis. Uh, nice. Would love it if MNAV stayed at 10 for decades. I wonder if that's possible. Yeah, 10 for decades. We would love that as well. There's a there's a natural decay in in MNAVs. Check out my other videos on that. Um, there's a lot of information there. Thank you for your excellent SWC coverage and insights. Much appreciated. Yeah, sure. Beautiful. Brilliant. We'll keep it going if you're loving these. Cheers. Micro touch low today. Yeah, brilliant. Thanks for that feedback. I did realize I have fixed it and um hopefully this one comes out okay. The one tomorrow, the first one might not because that wasn't fixed by then, but the the rest should. Trying to up the game here on this side, but um bear with me on that.

(0:12:00) Great stuff. I'm a convert from MSTR to SWC, so not new to the space, but definitely a noob to the real mechanics. Can you explain what a book build is in a little more detail as part of one of your new vid vids? Yeah, sure. I can go into that if you want. Um, cool. Thanks so much, Wra taking the time to reply. Looking forward to the next update. Yep. Bitcoin Treasury MNAV update. Uh, what was that in relation to? Oh, this was I think you were asking about the model. Um, good stuff. It's crazy. Apart from the Bitcoin Ether Reserve who have the most coins or strategic planning to increase BTC yield without much darling are going red in the market but the ones who have just speculate going parabolic. Anyways, I'm holding Meta Planet and the stock for longterm. I'm not interested in day trading and chasing trends. Thanks for the nice vid. Cool. Yeah, look, there's lots of different factors that going into um share price movements and uh the ones with the consistent strategies I think will win out in the end. It's um it's a model.

(0:13:00) Um Andy Smith saying I'm crazy, too. This was when I Yeah, I got shocked when the uh the announcement started coming out. So, I thought there's still a lot of people talking about this. 36 million pounds has been raised since um since a April UK buy I'm Steve the dreamer of dreams is saying I'm in the UK buying SWC on hard griefs lands down at AG AJ Bell both have quite a high commission charge yeah makes makes little and often buys very unattractive where is everyone else buying I think there is a a list in the group um do check that out in the community Steve if not maybe someone else can reply here to say where they these are the ones I'm aware of as well So, um, yeah, thanks for your comment, by the way. Keep commenting.

(0:14:00) Uh, Pricey 23100 is just, uh, 54. Hello, Vos. Love the channel and your model. I'm glad glad the model's getting some love. Um, yeah, no financial advice. This is just an entertaining model, so play about with it. I read about this stock that randomly came into my newsfeed one day in June, not really knowing or understanding the stock. So, I looked online for all the videos, got to know Andrew Wembley and the team through vids and stats. Two weeks later, your channel popped up. This channel is popping up. It's going to pop bigger. Uh, as I was looking for more info, I've been watching and learning ever since. I really don't know what I'm doing. Do Do you think I know this is a DJ channel? Only joking. But what I'm doing, but I just feel like this should stock could go up any go anywhere, anytime. Yeah, this this is why this is why it's so interesting. Can go anywhere anytime. Strapped in. ready for the ride so far. Now trying to sell the house to put more in. Oh my goodness me. My parents are thrilled that I'm moving back in with them. Anyways, thank you for your work on this and have a nice day. PS would like greater control to edit the model, specifically the share price column and the share sold column. I would really appre Okay, I'll take a look at that. Also, could you do 10 videos a day? Just joking on the You joke about that. I can do 10 videos a day. I mean, I I I've got the content. All I need is just uh an editor. Um 10 videos a day. I actually thought about that and what what it would take to do that. Not a lot would needed be needed. So I'm not going to do 10 videos a day.
