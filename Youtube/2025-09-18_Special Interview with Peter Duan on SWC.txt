**James:**
(0:00:01) Hey, I think we're live. Um, thank you for joining me, Peter. It's it's great to have you on. I've been following you for a while and and you know, reading your tweets and all that stuff. Um, and you know, more recently, you've you've got into the world of SWVC, which I'm pleased about and I think the community is pleased about. So, um, why don't you start uh by giving us a bit more of an introduction? Yeah, a bit about your background, but more about how did you get into Bitcoin? How did you get into MSTR, MetaPlanet, and then now SWC?

**Peter Duan:**
(0:00:33) Yeah. Um, long story short, I've worked in traditional finance for all my adult life, which up until this point's like 14 years. Um, I didn't like I learned very briefly about Bitcoin during the last cycle in 2020, 2021, but like a lot of people, I was trying to probably chase the dragon and uh got into altcoins and lost a bunch of money. Um, so I kind of like put it on the back burner like just thinking like, "Oh, it's all a scam." Up until the fact that a couple years ago, um, well, early of last year when the Bitcoin ETFs were announced through Black Rockck and Fidelity, that reinvigorated my interest because in my opinion, uh, Fidelity and Black Rockck, Black Rockck is the largest asset manager in the world, Fidelity is the
[01:32] third, uh, Vanguard's the second. Um but I would I thought that the number one [01:39] and the number three largest asset manager in the world would not risk their financial reputation on a pump and [01:47] dump or a scam. And so that um and also I had a couple colleagues who were Bitcoiners uh not you know crypto stuff [01:54] but Bitcoiners and so I just started debating with them and they just recommended me a couple books. So, I [02:01] kind of went down that rabbit hole and yeah, became a Bitcoiner um early last year. Uh and what really drew me to the [02:09] Bitcoin Treasury space was uh my algorithm on YouTube knows me probably better than myself. Um so they showed me [02:17] Quant Bros one. Uh so shout out to Jeff Wen and Rag Quant for showing me uh you [02:24] know what MSTR was doing. That really uh was a very big light bulb moment for me [02:31] simply because I already knew how amazing Bitcoin was. But then for Bitcoin to be effectively the financial [02:39] backbone of this new financial world that we're entering in was very very [02:44] exciting. Um so I just jumped head in. And then fast forward to strategy world [02:51] early this year in Orlando. That was my first chance to meet everybody including Simon and Dylan. And yeah, when I um [02:59] spoke with Simon I and Dylan, I was just very blown away on their conviction, [03:04] their execution, but more importantly like kind of their goals. like um just [03:10] to give you some perspective at the end of last year for MetaPlanet there were around 1,700 Bitcoin and then they were

**James:**
[03:18] talking some crazy numbers at that point of they want 30,000 at the end of this [03:23] year um and then 100,000 by the end of next year and then 210,000 by the end of [03:30] um 2026 and I was like how are they going to get there? But then if you look [03:35] at like their execution and how they were the number one performing equity in 2024, [03:40] uh clearly they can execute. And so yeah, I was part of the first wave to [03:45] jump um pretty heavy into MetaPlanet. I just increased my conviction over time. [03:52] Um but yeah, I I've been in that space and then uh I observed that one of the [03:58] key metrics in the Bitcoin treasury space is the fact that the community size is really important. Uh the reason [04:05] for that is because I have that traditional finance background. Um, I know that I'm being generous here when I [04:12] say that 95% of Wall Street don't fully understand Bitcoin and 99.99% of Wall [04:18] Street definitely do not understand Bitcoin treasury companies. So, what that effectively means is that you need [04:24] the first wave of investors need to be pretty hardcore Bitcoiners who most [04:29] likely already have an existing Bitcoin treasury position in a a stock like MSTR [04:36] or Metanet. Now, um when Metap Plan when uh Smarter Web ran up, um I I don't [04:42] know, it's a six or seven dollars, I thought, "Oh, I missed that train." Uh but, you know, here we are where I have

**Peter Duan:**
[04:48] the opportunity to to dive in. And I was very impressed by the the community growth. Um it's the third largest community behind MSTR and Metaplanet. Um and so, yeah, and when I entered the community, it was very warm. Um very positive. Uh, and that only kind of contributes to um, yeah, the MNAV, which which is the thing that drives uh, Bitcoin yield.

**James:**
(0:05:13) So, okay, cool. Um, and by the way, to everyone who's watching, it's down to the people in the community um, that make it that way. So, thank you very much for everyone that contributes. And if you haven't contributed, please get stuck in and uh, and and make your first posts. Um, okay. So other than community, what what about what what was it about SWBC?

**Peter Duan:**
(0:05:38) Yeah. Um I like to say that a good bakery treasury company uh needs to have what I call the holy trinity of growth, but I've now recently revised that to I don't know what to quite call it yet, but you need four major factors. Um the number one factor is you having a laser focused CEO who has both great communication style uh in in uh clarity as well as consistency which Andrew does that in spades. Uh I think he leads the Bitcoin treasury space in communication with the community. Um and then you also have someone like Jesse Meyers who uh while not Wall Street per se, he was a Bane consultant. So he you know he has clearly a lot of uh financial knowledge um and he's also been a known quantity in the Bitcoin treasury space. So uh the first leg is a laser focused CEO who's good at communication recruitment. Second leg is a Bitcoiner who can traverse the trady world with the um with the Bitcoin world. Uh and preferably having that person having a pretty significant social media following. And then only after uh clear communication and execution do they deserve a rapid community which we are lucky to be a part of. Uh because again it is that rapid retail community that gives us um the ability to be above 1 M. now to allow us to play the accretive dilutive game. But then recently it came to my attention especially and I'm sure we'll talk about this later uh comes to my attention at this conference where I asked pretty much every single major Bitcoin treasury company CEO what is um the bottleneck for growth and everyone had pretty much said the same thing which is fundraising. So, you need all four of those to um execute very successfully. Um yeah, and thus far I've been very impressed with Smarter Web in all four domains.

**James:**
(0:07:42) Awesome. So, um based off the last couple of months, you know, you got your opportunity to get back in or to get into uh SWC. Um

**Peter Duan:**
[07:57] you know, it's a sectorwide contraction. Um uh obviously not that long ago there are [08:05] only a few companies that we could look at that on primarily MetaPlanet really. Um what do you what's your thoughts on [08:12] like the cyclical nature because you know a lot of people have mentioned four month cycles uh for MetaPlanet. Um where [08:19] are you at with that? Uh I I don't know. Um, I think we got to be a little bit careful of extrapolating [08:27] past data into the future simply because there's so few data points. So, for example, like a lot of people would talk [08:33] about the Bitcoin four-year cycle. Well, yes, that is primarily driven through the having cycles, but again, that's [08:40] literally what three data points and we're in the middle of the fourth. So, yeah, you got to be very careful about [08:47] drawing such broad speculation with so little data points. Uh but that being said, I do see that these um time frames [08:54] are much much shorter for Bitcoin Treasury companies. Um now, uh I don't, [09:00] you know, I would never recommend I one way or another to hodddle through it or trade it. Um you'll get cut both ways if [09:07] you don't do it well. And uh if if Bitcoin is a speeding bullet train, um [09:14] then uh or if Bitcoin is, you know, like a like a fast car, right? Um then I [09:21] would say Bitcoin Treasure Company is F1 racing. Uh you you got to be you got to [09:26] have very high skill, very deep knowledge, very high conviction and if [09:32] especially if you can trade this well, I mean you got to be you got to be some of the smartest, you know, retail investors

**James:**
[09:38] in the planet. Okay, cool. And what talking of cycles? [09:43] What about uh Bitcoin cycles? because you know uh like you say three data [09:49] points but you know that's all we've got to go on with Bitcoin. It's only been [09:55] around 16 years. Um do you think that's going to change now? [10:00] Uh I don't know. Um I don't really think too too much about [10:06] the cycles. I I do know that out of all the data points and this is something that Lynn Alden points out is Bitcoin [10:14] has a very very high correlation to u global liquidity and so uh the one [10:20] person I follow pretty closely on that is Michael how uh he I've written a [10:26] thread about him he comes from Solomon brothers uh he [10:32] measures global liquidity very closely uh some people just kind of have a broad stroke and measure measure global [10:38] liquidity using the M2 money supply, but he uses many more metrics. Um, yeah, [10:43] some people can argue that he does this so that he can, you know, pump his own company's research. Uh, but at the end [10:50] of the day, uh, everything that he said is very logical um, and data based. So [10:55] yeah, if you were to follow the Bitcoin money supply, uh the liquidity supply to play the cycles, I'd follow Marco How, [11:02] but I'm not particularly keen on trying to trade, you know, these cycles too

**Peter Duan:**
[11:07] aggressively myself. Sure. And what about um uh if we did an [11:15] assumption, you don't have to answer this if you don't want to, but um an assumption that we're on a 4-year cycleish. Um what would be your end like [11:23] your cycle peak kind of prediction? Uh yeah, I yeah, I I guess I'll in [11:30] America we say I'll play the fifth on that because uh it's kind of similar to um price predictions. You can't really [11:36] win either way. Um, again, uh, this is according Ben Workman. He says, um, you [11:44] know, investing is an individual sport. Um, so I I I I never play the price prediction game. [11:50] Okay. Um, that's fair enough. Um, okay. What [11:56] What was the NYC unconference like? Um, you were there yesterday. Um, spill the [12:03] beans. Yeah, that's what we say in the Brit. Yeah, we say that too here um in [12:09] America. Uh first of all, shout out to um Tim Cottsman and Julene. Um and then [12:15] shout out to Adrian who's running the tech behind it. Uh it was a very very well-round conference. Uh as you as we [12:22] talked about before this call, it was a very nice intimate setting. There's only probably about 250 to 300 people there. [12:29] Uh but it was primarily, you know, who you think is going to be there was [12:34] there. Um for the Bitcoin Treasury space, of course, not everybody was there, but I would say 80% of the big [12:41] names were there. Metanet wasn't there. The Nakamoto team wasn't there. Um but pretty much everyone else was was there.

**James:**
[12:48] So, it was really nice to um see people face to face and uh really get to bend [12:55] their ears a little bit off things that, you know, are not public on X to really [13:00] get their sentiment. Um to be honest, everybody is very uh [13:06] bullish um not in the hype kind of way, but rather just excited about helping [13:12] shape the financial future of tomorrow. So it was not exuberant, it was not [13:17] depressed at all. It was very even killed. And that's what I like. I I I myself am a very I try to be a very um [13:25] stoic person when it comes to investing. And so it was just really nice to uh go [13:30] beyond the emotions and into kind of how can we build together, which is very exciting. [13:36] Okay, cool. I guess uh maybe it's slightly easier when you're running the [13:41] company and you're not uh owning the shares in the same way as a retail investor to be [13:47] well well you know the it can cut both ways right like Andrew himself has uh I [13:53] mean of course he he has Bitcoin but the rest of his assets are in in Bitcoin [13:58] treasury companies so you can it's fair to say that these guys have even more skin in the game than the average retail [14:04] investor. So, um, of course it depends on the CEO, like some CEOs don't, but, [14:10] uh, I can, at least according to what Andrew says, you know, most of his net worth is in Bitcoin and smarter web. So,

**Peter Duan:**
[14:17] yeah. Okay. Awesome. And what what are the [14:22] sort of, you know, uh, there's a few kind of upcoming things that we're speculating about. Um, there was some [14:29] speculation, was it last week, about uh, acquisitions. Um although Jesse kind of [14:35] put a dampener on that saying they're not actively pursuing anything at the moment but you know acquisitions [14:40] potential LC uplisting maybe even footsy 250 qualification or anything else you [14:46] know what are the future things that you're excited about? Yeah. Uh I definitely think that the [14:53] right track for them and I'm sure they've already kind of telegraphed that that's the direction that they're going. [14:58] Uh especially through the hiring of their new CFO who has footsy 250 [15:03] experience I think um is that that's the general direction you want to go. You you're starting off at these call it [15:10] lower liquidity smaller markets just to build momentum. But as you build that momentum, as your volume, your trading [15:17] volume increases, you want to obviously play in a bit bigger uh you go from the pond to a bigger ocean. So that makes a [15:23] lot of logical sense. Um now I don't know what that uh involves on the back [15:29] end, but yeah, I just rely on the the leadership to try to execute on that. I [15:35] don't have a particular time frame. um everything's very market driven and and [15:40] I definitely don't know the regulatory space in the UK. Um so again, I would never speculate on a timeline, but that

**James:**
[15:46] is a general direction that I think they're going to go. Okay, cool. Um and yeah, so just talking [15:54] about the the hire of the CFO, um there are a few things announced in a short sort of space of time. new CFO, um the [16:04] change of auditor, um what was that? I can't remember what the third one was now. Um [16:11] they got a new marketing manager as well. Yeah. Yeah. I think there's another [16:16] anyway and and so there, you know, and my first thoughts were, okay, great. That's that's prepping for LSE up [16:22] listing. Um but then uh Bourja from [16:28] Roxom said uh or or they put out a tweet saying this is actually structuring um [16:37] for larger capital deals uh for for bigger equity raises etc. Um what what [16:43] are your thoughts on that? um in regards to like uplifting. Yeah, [16:49] that that makes sense, right? Like as you get uplisted, you get more uh access [16:54] to the capital markets and so that increases liquidity that allows us to [16:59] play this accretive dilution game even further. So yeah, um that's definitely [17:05] in line with the thesis of uh just trying to get bigger and bigger. Sure. And [17:11] how was it actually meeting Andrew in person? Um, and how how was he received [17:17] in general? If you if you notice, I I think um Andrew and Jesse

**Peter Duan:**
[17:23] uh are what you see online in the regards that they're very humble, uh very dedicated, [17:30] not pretentious, um and just yeah, very hardworking people. The what I saw [17:36] online was exactly what I I got in person. There was no Jackal and Hide uh [17:42] impression. It was just Yeah. They're they're the they're softspoken as I said to Andrew. Um when I first saw him on [17:49] stage at Bitcoin Vegas event earlier of this year in February, uh there was [17:55] quite a he was on a panel with quite a few other Bitcoin Treasure companies. Um and every single one of them were [18:01] saying, "Oh, like we're trying to get to 1%, you know, we're trying to be like the largest this, largest that." and [18:07] Andrew was just kind of the last one who says like, "Hey, um yeah, we're just going to work hard to be in the top 10 [18:12] and hopefully we get there." And he was just very soft spoken. So, at first, um [18:17] I was a little bit um that's actually one of the initial reasons why I wasn't so keen on smarter web initially. It was [18:25] because like, oh, like he's so softspoken that I felt like he didn't he lacked ambition. But really what he is [18:31] is uh I told him this. I said, you know, you speak quietly but carry a big stick, which I think is actually much more [18:38] impactful in the long run. Yeah, for sure. Um, and so for you, are [18:46] treasuries kind of a long-term conviction play? Like you're looking way [18:52] into the future rather than the dayby-day share price kind of thing. Yeah.

**James:**
[18:58] Okay. and and um there's been some discussion in the UK scene about what uh [19:05] Bitcoin treasuries become. Um do you have any thoughts on that kind of [19:11] thing? I mean I'm not in the UK so I guess why don't you share with me some of the [19:17] things that they said and then maybe we can uh dissect it. So, you know, I think [19:23] a lot of CEOs and stuff have kind of said, well, that's that's something to deal with in in 20 30 years kind of [19:29] thing. Um, but you but it's the usual thing of, oh, [19:34] they're going to be the Bitcoin bank or, you know, that kind of stuff. I was just wondering whether you had any thoughts [19:40] on Yeah. Um, what they're going to do with this massive stack of Bitcoin. [19:47] Uh, I think that the biggest players are going to be Bitcoin banks. [19:55] Um, the way I think about it is there's three levels of Bitcoin treasury companies. Level one is [20:03] you're a company owner. You're a Bitcoiner and you simply realize that the cash you're sitting on is a melting [20:09] ice cube and therefore you convert a certain portion of that cash pile into Bitcoin. Um, now that could be a [20:16] combination or that could be either a private company in which obviously you cannot play the creative dilution game [20:21] or a public company. But if you're a public company, but you do not have a massive following and you're always [20:28] floating um at or even below one MNAV, then you're kind of stuck in what I call

**Peter Duan:**
[20:33] level one. Level two is you are definitely a publicly traded company. [20:39] You also have some sort of retail investor base that believes in your execution and vision to reward you with [20:46] something that's above one MNAV. So you can play the accretion dilution game. Level three is um you are everything I [20:54] mentioned in level two but you have a certain size uh of stack of a bitcoin [20:59] stack and now you are um a innovator [21:04] who's tapping the institutional markets uh relying now primarily on the institutional markets as your [21:10] shareholder base rather than the retail base. So definitely MSTR is in that bucket. Metaplanet is pretty much [21:17] transitioned there. uh if if not in the next at least couple of months but pretty much there but then everybody [21:24] else is scrambling to um try to get there. job. And what's your view on uh multiple [21:32] BTC's in uh a single jurisdiction like do you [21:37] think a juris jurisdiction can cope with multiple [21:42] uh a couple things uh one depends on the size of your capital markets. So [21:48] obviously if you're looking at the US we have the deepest capital markets with I don't know $30 trillion of uh equities [21:55] and blah blah blah blah blah. So it's very deep and therefore you can differentiate yourself very well and I [22:00] don't know if you had a chance to watch the live stream from the on conference yesterday but sailor's initial speech is

**James:**
[22:07] effectively that um the fixed income market is 300 [22:13] trillion and that pretty much is that's $300 trillion of dying capital and so [22:23] Bitcoin treasury companies done well and issuing preferreds are can can provide a lot a lot of [22:32] services to that. So, it's going to be many decades if not like even in our [22:38] lifetimes where that would be saturated and we're using a baseball analogy. There's nine innings in baseball. We're [22:45] at the top of the first inning. Like we like the game hasn't even begun. Like maybe Metaplan, sorry, maybe MSTR is [22:52] bottom of the first inning. Metaplan is like in the middle of the first inning, but I mean we have such a long runway. [23:00] Okay, cool. And um I know you said you don't kind of get into timeline [23:05] predictions or price predictions and stuff, but um when Andrew and Jesse were on your show last week um and to anyone [23:11] who hasn't watched it, go and watch it. It was great. Um you they mentioned uh Andrew gave you [23:19] his gut feeling even though you didn't ask for it. um of that SWC would get [23:26] into onto the into the 250 before um [23:33] strategy got into the S&P 500. Um I was kind of thinking strategy would [23:39] get in next time round. I don't know what your thoughts thoughts are that. Yeah, I mean that's very hard to [23:45] tell simply because it's the S&P 500 is more on a go to old boys secret

**Peter Duan:**
[23:51] committee level rather than a metric level. So I don't know how that process [23:57] works. I I doubt most people know how that works. So again I I I [24:03] really I I very rarely think too much about anything in in one year time [24:10] frame. Um I'm just know that like Bitcoin is going to go up. we're going to get in. It's just a time of when. So, [24:16] I don't really sweat the details on on timing, per se. Sure. I guess that's bullish for SWC [24:22] because of it doesn't have that committee decision. It's just purely done on [24:27] on the metrics. And exactly. And to be honest, like if you are a SWC investor and not an MSTR [24:34] investor, you'd actually prefer them not to get in, right? Because if MSTR gets in then immediately that's I don't know [24:42] 1520 billion dollars of capital that what do you think MSTR is going to do with that? They're going to smash by [24:48] Bitcoin. Uh that's going to jack up the price so that our our average price per Bitcoin that we acquire is at a higher [24:55] rate. So you know but at the end of the day what's good for Bitcoin raises all [25:00] tides. But yeah, if you're just thinking about on a shareholder perspective, you would actually not want MSDR to get in [25:06] the S&P 500 before you do, you know. Yeah, I think I think most of our investor base probably are in MSDR as [25:13] well. So, sure, it's kind of not all of them. Um, okay, cool. Um, [25:21] I think that's kind of me with questions. Is there anything you wanted to add? Oh, no, sorry, one more. I think

**James:**
[25:27] I read online that you uh sort of have online marketing experience. Um [25:34] and so I was just thinking, have you got a message for the SWC community about [25:40] the things that they could be doing to help kind of uh grow the community, spread the word, get more people in, [25:47] that kind of thing? Yeah, that's a great question. Um it's not just the SWC community. I think it's [25:54] the entire Bitcoin Twitter sphere is um [25:59] because Bitcoiners are very logical people. They rarely think about [26:04] marketing uh building a social base um because that's very qualitative and if it's not [26:11] something that we can easily analyze through numbers, we don't emphasize. However, [26:17] um however, we're in the attention economy. [26:23] Uh there's a very specific reason why this current AI boom started off from a [26:30] paper written by Google that's called attention's all you need. And so with [26:35] attention comes the capital. Whether that is for yourself personally as a personal brand or if you're a Bitcoin [26:42] treasury company, you want to increase your reach to therefore get more investors or if you're a Bitcoin service [26:49] company where you want to get more people to buy your products or services. Everybody needs to have a distribution [26:55] platform. And so with that, you need to know how to play the social media game.

**Peter Duan:**
[27:02] And so uh I have a wide range of experiences but one of them was I had my [27:08] own investment education company uh for two and a half years. Uh during that [27:14] process it was effectively getting an MBA in online marketing. Um and so if [27:22] you think about it right like online marketing in general you can think of it as a funnel. [27:28] That's because uh the statistics are you need about eight to 14 touches for [27:35] somebody to like each touch point is like you seeing their content, right? It's like uh and obviously the high the [27:42] the ticket the the product the more touches you need to gain that person's trust. [27:48] And so social media is the top of the funnel. And then you need to effectively [27:53] win them over to like, oh, like I see their content to like saying, oh, like I actually like what this guy says. Like [27:59] after I see his content a couple times, I'm going follow them. Okay. Then then you lead them down to um to the middle [28:08] of the funnel. So for me, um I'm building something called the Bull Standard Academy, which is actually to [28:14] help uh Bitcoin companies and Bitcoin content creators and Bitcoin Treasury companies increase their social outreach [28:22] on X. Now, that's in beta right now where I'm still incubating it and I'm I'm just building that out. But that's [28:29] the middle of the funnel where you get to learn the best practices because the algorithm changes. As a matter of fact, [28:35] the algorithm just recently changed where I'm scrambling to figure it out still. Uh, but I'm aggregating some of

**James:**
[28:41] the best content creators in the space to share their knowledge and then as we [28:47] codify it and there's more um analysis done uh um and and we get the results [28:53] then we're going to convert it into a course within the community which you can access for free. Um, and so that's [28:59] kind of the middle of the funnel. And but then the bottom of the funnel is, well, there's companies who's going to join that community and they're like, [29:06] "Oh, I'm trying to learn it. I'm trying to implement it, but I don't have the time. I don't have the bandwidth. Maybe [29:11] you can do it for me or you can you can do one-on-one coaching." And that's more high ticket, right? And that's not [29:17] isolated to me. That's going to be people who's already in the community contributing. They can, you know, make [29:23] money that way. So that's what I'm building on my end because I as you know [29:29] yes I have a 14- year traditional finance background but actually my specialty in the Bitcoin space is [29:35] marketing and distribution. I've I created my ex account a couple years ago, but I only got active in October of [29:42] last year. And so in that time span, I grew it to roughly 22,000 followers. Uh [29:48] which, you know, I ran it through Grock and it's in the 99.9 percentile of of [29:54] growth and follower base. So that's my specialty. And if you're looking to [29:59] increase your influence, um, not so much like for your own glory, but rather like you have, you know, you have something [30:05] to say, you have a product, you know, you that you you you want to talk about your investments to hopefully pump

**Peter Duan:**
[30:11] everybody's bags, you know, that's a way to go where you increase your social outreach by learning how that game is [30:18] played. Okay, cool. So, so on a community level, are we talking about members of the [30:24] community liking, reposting, replying, sharing with friends, I don't know, [30:30] adding commentary, putting things in other communities maybe? I don't know what is that. Yeah, good stuff. [30:36] That's a great question. That's So when I first entered the space, um I was just [30:41] like posting for fun and it was gaining a good amount of traction, but I really like at first I was just cracking a lot [30:47] of jokes and then like I noticed some people were saying like, "Oh, like this guy's kind of a meme guy." I was like, "Well, I don't I have more to say than [30:54] just being a funny guy, right?" And so I was like, "Well, okay, like what do I really want to be known for?" Well, [31:01] well, I just want to like provide a lot of like value and if I'm already trying to learn from the space, why don't I [31:08] just take the little bit of extra time to kind of distill what I'm learning? And so, what I've what I did is I call [31:15] it borrowing leverage, right? So, if there is a bigger account that um that [31:23] creates good content, that's already like doing podcasts, that's already like showing up consistently um to like get [31:31] their message out and you and you like their content and you're already studying it, then what I would do is [31:36] just summarize that uh in my terms for other people. And inevitably if that uh [31:43] content, you know, blows up, uh oftentimes that person will actually

**James:**
[31:49] retweet it themselves and then if they really like you, they'll follow you back. And so that's how like, you know, [31:56] it's kind of like a fish analogy, right? You're like a little guppy and you're just trying to like ride the waves of [32:01] someone bigger. Uh but inevitably if they like you, like they're going to like add you in their in their group, [32:07] right? And so that's exactly actually how Jesse and I became friends is um he was on a podcast and uh I wrote a thread [32:15] that went super viral and then he asked me to write another thread for something [32:20] else he created. Um and I was like oh like cool I'm happy to do it and then yeah we we became friends that way. So, [32:28] um, if you're already doing the hard work of of taking the time to, um, study [32:33] the space, uh, from people you admire, then like help winners win, right? Help [32:38] them amplify the message and in return um, they'll probably follow you back and that's how you gain social social clout, [32:45] if you will. Fantastic. Thank you very much. So, community members, you know what to do. [32:51] Um, okay. Just a question that's coming on the chat. Um, have you ever been [32:56] asked to join a Bitcoin treasury? Um, and um cuz you would be an asset and if [33:05] you weren't interested, why not? Why why weren't you interested? Uh, thank you. Uh, that that is a good [33:10] question. I I've had uh a few conversations. Um, [33:17] uh, well, first of all, I'm a Christian, so I think everything happens for a reason. like one in particular fell

**Peter Duan:**
[33:22] through that I thought I was going to get. Um but I think in hindsight everything happened for a reason and um [33:30] just taking a step back from why that fell through like and having a little bit further distance like I'm actually [33:36] glad that that fell through simply because I didn't like certain things that was being done. But I also think [33:42] that we're in this wild wild west stage where just because it's a hot trend [33:49] doesn't mean that you should jump onto everything. Matter of fact, I think it's much wiser [33:56] to survive a bare market together. I mean, we're we're experiencing bare market now despite a Bitcoin run. Just [34:03] imagine like a Bitcoin bare market with a amplified Bitcoin Treasury MNAV [34:09] compression market. That's going to be a bloodbath of epic proportion, right? [34:15] Epic proportion. And so if that's the case, then uh unless you have an iron [34:21] stomach and this this place, you know, the Bitcoin Treasury Company has amazing [34:26] amazing people that will help you ride through it. Um there's going to be a lot of deals that blow up and a lot of [34:32] people's reputations are going to get ruined. And for me, I don't really care about money that much. Not that like I'm [34:38] a gigga multi-millionaire, it's just that I care about my reputation more than um anything, right? Uh well not as [34:45] much as like my relationship with with God and my my mom and my friends but [34:50] that's like besides that that's my most important thing. So it's better to be

**James:**
[34:57] the tortoise uh as opposed to the hair uh where you get to observe best practices and um using another baseball [35:04] analogy is waiting for the fat pitch so that when you swing you make sure you swing for the home run rather than just [35:10] take everything that was offered your way. Sure. And you know, assuming there isn't [35:16] a a Bitcoin bare market, um it'll be the strongest that survive, right? It's [35:22] going to weed out, correct? Weed out quite a lot of them. And that was uh you know, to your [35:27] question earlier about what are some takeaways from the Bitcoin conference. [35:32] Uh there have been so many conversations that I had where it's like, dude, uh all these guys are obviously seeing all [35:38] these deals and they're just like there's so many bad deals. So, so many [35:43] bad deals. Uh, everybody's trying to make a quick buck. Um, and it's only those who are patient, strategic, which [35:50] I I bucket Jesse and Andrew on them waiting for the fat pitch. They're not just taking any money that's thrown [35:57] their way. U, that is the winning strategy. You don't want to be swinging [36:02] for the fences and um trying to be the gold medal winner. Like I heard another [36:07] CEO talk about like they actually have a bronze medal strategy where it's like, "Hey, as long as like I'm in the game um [36:15] and not get blown out, that's actually how you win in the long run." [36:20] Yeah, for sure. And I think Sailor reiterated that yesterday as well, didn't he? Um about uh taking the right

**Peter Duan:**
[36:27] money. It's easy. The money the money that comes to you is is the money you [36:32] don't want. It's the money you got to go out and work for. Yes. I I'm glad you brought up that point cuz yeah, he named off like, oh, [36:39] Three Arrows Capital, FTX, Celsius, every single one of them pitched him. Um, but I'm glad that he [36:46] didn't take those deals. Yeah, for sure. Okay, Peter. Well, thank [36:51] you very much. It's been a pleasure to have you on. Um, I hope we we we keep in contact and um and I'll I'll keep liking [36:59] and sharing your stuff because it's good. Oh, thank you so much. Thank you so much. It was a pleasure speaking to you. Um, [37:04] shout out to the smarter web community out of I I'm a part of many communities on X, but you guys have the best um [37:11] attitude. Uh, you guys are very positive despite the recent price action and if [37:17] you are willing to stomach it, you will get rewarded in the end, I believe. Um, but yeah, you just got to be patient and [37:24] believe that uh Andrew and Jesse are doing everything in their power uh to to [37:29] really drive shareholder value, which I fir I firmly firmly believe. Brilliant. Thanks, Peter. [37:36] Nice talking to you, James. Thank you, everyone.
