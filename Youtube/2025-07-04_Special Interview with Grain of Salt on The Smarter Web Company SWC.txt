## Key Topics:
- Why SWC attracted Grain's attention: UK first mover advantage, Bitcoin treasury playbook, early-stage mega returns
- Technical investing vs fundamental investing: moving averages, death cross/golden cross, momentum trading
- Tax strategy: IRA vs brokerage accounts, different plans for same stock based on tax implications
- UK tax-advantaged accounts: ISA (Individual Savings Account) and SIP (Self-Invested Pension Plan)
- International retirement account comparison: NISA (Japan), ISA/SIP (UK), TFSA (Canada), 401k/IRA (US)
- Bitcoin education simplified: house price example (500 BTC in 2017 vs 10 BTC today for same house)
- Hardest part of investing: waiting, not due diligence or trading
- Different pools of capital: UK exchange (pounds) vs US OTC market (dollars)
- Market inefficiency = greatest profit opportunity: "Most amount of money made when market is most inefficient"
- OTC uplisting progression: Pink Sheets → OTCQB → OTCQX attracts larger pools of capital
- Arbitrage opportunities between UK and US exchanges for SWC
- Options trading: inevitable but not yet available for SWC - creates price discovery and volatility
- What SWC needs: charismatic CEO constantly communicating (like Saylor), relentless public presence
- Convertible bonds analysis: delta hedging problem, converts create resistance via puts/collars
- Preferred stocks vs convertible bonds: debate on skipping converts and going straight to preferreds
- Early-stage advantage: no derivatives market = pure price discovery, higher volatility, better returns
- Strategy comparison: MSTR's $8B in converts, covered call strategies (MSTI), market maturity effects
- Goal of sovereign nations: make citizens as rich as possible to reduce government dependency

**Grain :**
[00:00] It was the narrative and I'm like, "Wow, this is in the UK." And I do think that in each sovereign nation, you're going to have a few winners. The hardest part is waiting. That that's the hard the hardest part investing is is not the trading or the due diligence. You could read that or throw into AI. The hardest part is waiting. The goal for every sovereign nation should be to make their citizens as rich as possible to compete in the world environment. And so the first mover advantage for the smarter web company for me is I was like, "Wow, the UK people are going to go crazy about this. I got to buy this." That's the most important question. We we'll end after that question. But you just asked the most important.

**James:**
[00:45] Hey G, thank you very much for joining me. Um it's it's good to meet you finally. Um, as you know, this channel's kind of dedicated to Smarter Web Company, but we will talk around a few bits and pieces. Um, I guess I kind of wanted to start with you. You posted on X uh couple of weeks ago when you went to Prague. Um, that you were you were interested in the smarter web company. What what what about it uh gained your interest?

**Grain :**
What gave my interest is that um investing in Bitcoin or Bitcoin treasury companies is about mental flexibility. It's about understanding that there will be companies that will follow what Michael Sailor has done with with with strategy is the Bitcoin treasury playbook. other it was well known that he wanted to build this ecosystem of other companies and they would do it in other other uh sovereign nations obviously United Kingdom and when I saw that I was like wow this company I looked at it from the price action so I'm what's called the technical investor and I looked at I'm like well since they're starting out and it what what sailor has done this is very important for a strategy they're going to be in this for a half a decade five years but the mega returns tend to happen early and that's why there's startups and IPOs and so forth. And so for me, I saw what happened with the smarter web company like oh they're following the playbook. I'm like I'm investing in that company because how much due diligence can you do? And the other the other part that I always tell people is that when you're doing something like this, I don't yolo all my money into it for for me at my at at where I am because I've been this for eight years. So, I put a portion into it that I that was interesting enough to do it and I was like, I'm now gonna watch this. So, that that's what was interesting to me was the price action. It was the narrative and I'm like, wow, this is in the UK. And I do think that in each sovereign nation, you're going to have a few winners. It'll be the top three companies that first mover advantage. But that's what I saw about it.

**James:**
Okay, cool. And you know you mentioned about uh technical trading and I listened to to a spaces you did with plank constant uh a week ago or so. Um, can you tell us a bit about like momentum trading and and just to give people because I I'm I well my theory is that I'm a value investor and I'm looking at the fundamentals of of you know the MNAB and and stuff like that but um yeah so

**Grain :**
so there there's there's simply two groups of people. There's uh the fundamentals and and they'll look at look at MNAV. They'll look at the balance sheet. They'll look at the income statement. The fancy term is IBIDA, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, which is the cash flow. They'll look at the income statement I just explained. Then they'll look at the balance sheet and say this company's worthy of investing. And there'll be other factors that'll happen that this the price might rocket up for these for these particular reasons. If it's a a a a pharmaceutical company, they'll release a new drug. They think it'll get approval and then they'll sell lots of that drug and stock price will go up. Therefore, buy it now. It's a value. That's fundamental investing. Technical people will look at, well, we like we like moving averages. The 50-day moving average, the 200 day moving average. That's your death cross and golden cross. Golden cross is when it goes up. The 50-day goes above the 200. The death cross is when it goes below. And so, people say this is voodoo science. Well, you're comparing it against itself. If so, if you see something has a 50-day moving average of $2 and it jumps up to eight dollars, it's four times the 50-day moving average, that is a massive jump. Typically, a company cannot survive above a four or fivex there. It has to correct. And so, you become about this. So, I want to be very clear about my my trading. I bought a position and I have not sold any I have not sold anything in the past two three weeks. I I bought a big I I announced that I bought some then I bought more in Prague and I don't day trade. I never go in and out in the stock in the same day. That is a weird that last time that happened was in 2017.

So I don't So while people call me a trader, it really is I will rotate or trade out of one stock and then I'll buy this other stock. And and this is the other important part to understand.

I can have two different plans for the same stock. They're like, "What do you mean by that?" I have a a brokerage account where I pay normal taxes, regular ordinary income taxes on that. It could be long-term capital gains if it's more than a year. in the IRA account, individual retirement account, the retirement accounts we have in the US, I could if I own something, I could sell all of it, trigger no taxable events. And so I'll be more aggressive in my IRA account than I will be in my brokerage account because my brokerage account on the exact same stock because I'm looking at the tax implication there. Whereas in the IRA account, that's the long time horizon and and I'm I'm 58 and and so from that perspective, if I'm not going to take that money out for years in the future, I have a very long time horizon. So in my trading, it's very important to understand the same stock, the smart I own it in both accounts. But if you talk to me like, well, how do you how do you look at the smarter web company? And I'm like, well, in my brokerage account, the regular taxable, I want to hold that for more than a year because I want to get long-term capital gains in the IRA account. I'm like, oh no, I think it's going to run. I'll sell something else and I'll put more into it faster. So, I'm the same investor, all the same information, but I have two different plans. I don't want to use the word strategy to confuse with with my with the company strategy. I have two different plans for the same stock even though they're in two different accounts and I want people understanding, you know, to hear that part. So, I'm not really like a

**James:**
That's great. Go ahead. That's kind of uh exactly how what I wanted to understand. Um and you mentioned about taxable accounts and stuff and obviously the UK um not dissimilar with regards you know your IAS and and things. We've got the SIP um and then you know Japan's got its own versions and Meta Metal Planet have seemingly done quite well out of that. Um you know does that has that was that an influence in in choosing a UK company to go after or did that kind of come to light later?

**Grain :**
So it it came to light later, but there was a there was a um an interview or pod with uh with Richard Bworth and Simon Gerovich. And what happened was Simon just admitted this that they did not realize that the Nissa account in Japan, which is the equivalent of the retirement accounts, was that people were buying this in in the retirement account in Japan and the light bulb went off in his head. Now that that was a big deal. So what I did then is I immediately I used chat GPT or Grock I use AI and what happened was there was a change in the way they do the Nissa account in Japan in 2024 which allowed people to be more aggressive with stocks in there in order to buy it and so there's also sometimes the you know good timing that just happened to happens. Now, also in the UK, I'm old school. I take notes and I write this down. And in the UK, I'm like, tell me the countries in in in Europe. And you got the SIP and the ISA account in the UK. Canada has the TFSA. Sweden has the ISK and and KF accounts. Germany, France, Netherlands, nothing. They don't have those accounts. And I'm like, oh my god. I'm like, that that's not good. And so, um, anyway, so does that sway me? Sure. Because if you're making all this money in your retirement account, it's this is counterintuitive. Why would somebody put a Bitcoin treasury company in their retirement account if Bitcoin is risky and volatile? It's volatile. I don't think it's risky, but then you have a long time horizon, which is great. And so, I think that that I think that that's important. And so for me, I think that what's going to happen to people in the UK, I think people like you, you're going to go tell your friends, you're like, "Wow, well, looks like James is going to retire in two years because he invested in the Smarter Web Company in his in your SIP account or your ISA account." And they're like, "How did that happen?"

I mean, that's the way I see it. So, I think I think there's going to be other people like you that are going to be like, "Well, this makes sense."

**James:**
Yeah. and and and we touched on it a little bit before we came on air about um financial education um and I think you know being completely honest there isn't much financial education in the UK um certainly and then and then you know without that imagine how low Bitcoin comes down the list right because you got to kind of understand finances to to to get Bitcoin um

**Grain :**
So, I guess let's un let's unpack that for a minute. I I I will give the the one minute pitch on Bitcoin and and and explain this so so people can understand so you could help explain Bitcoin to other people. Um if so with Bitcoin in Jan on January 1st of 2017, Bitcoin was $1,000. I like using the round numbers. It's $1,000. So, if there is a $500,000 house in America on January 1st of 2017, you need 500 grand. Now, assuming, just assume there's no taxes. It would take it would take 500 bitcoins to buy that house. Okay? Let's assume Bitcoin is $100,000. Now, it's a little bit more, but let's just assume it's 100,000. It only takes five bitcoins. So, the Bitcoin did not go up in value. it takes more dollars or more euros or more yen to buy that same bitcoin. So that same house I and let's say that house did appreciate to a million dollars. It only takes 10 bitcoins. It took it took 500 and now it takes 10. And so that's where the the money printing comes into this. I didn't need an hour or two hours explaining to you Bitcoin. It's that simple. And once you see that, you cannot unsee that. And that is when they go, that's where I change my unit of account. So people are like, let me who's Satoshi and what's the difficulty? What's the heck? I'm like, now if you can't understand what I just said, we can't go forward and talk about Bitcoin anymore. And that's the easiest number. You're like, oh, well, it took you eight years. I'm like, think about that. eight years and now you can go buy a if you only bought 50 bitcoins back then, right? How much that would be worth today? And and so that's can you wait eight years? The hardest part is waiting.

That that's the hard the hardest part of investing is is not the trading or the due diligence. You could read that or throw in into AI. The hardest part is waiting. So that's the part I want, you know, get back to what you were saying here is that when somebody talks about this financial literacy, it's one part. The other thing that I when I talk to people about Bitcoin, it's like, do you own Microsoft or Apple stock? Not an ETF, not a mutual fund. Do you Oh, no. I I don't own Would you buy Microsoft stock? No.

I'm like, I'm gonna go grab a It's not a Diet Coke. I'm gonna go grab I can't talk to you anymore. if buying Apple stock is too risky for you, there's no sense in talking about Bitcoin. And people are like that, but that's terrible, but you're not giving them the financial education. They are not intellectually curious enough to understand what's going on. So, it's a long-winded answer to what you're to what you're asking about financial literacy, but it's that simple. If you're if if if Microsoft or Apple or Netflix stock is too risky for you, that that person needs to look inside and say, "Oh, why are you so adverse to just buying Microsoft, let alone let alone some magical internet money invented by some guy who we girl who we don't know who it is, right? That nobody determines the price of and has no cash flows. if if you can't buy Microsoft and then I got to convince you of this.

**James:**
It's an interesting point actually because um something came out in the last uh maybe 48 hours that the So there's two types of ISER in the UK. I'm going to give you a little bit of financial education on on the UK. There's a cash ISER which just pays you interest. So it's literally a a cash savings account and you have a limit to how much you can put in each year and and the interest is paid taxree and then you have a stocks and shares is okay and the stocks and shares is whatever happens within that ISA whether it's dividends or capital appreciation you don't it's all non-T taxable even when you take it out.

**Grain :**
Yeah, even when you take it out

**James:**
and you're allowed to put up to 20,000 a year into each, I believe. I need to check that. The the UK government just announced that they're looking at um reducing the allowance for the cash ISA from 20,000 down to 5,000 a year.

**Grain :**
Okay, I I got to chime in right here. That is when you have to tell your politicians to all the UK uh citizens, that's when you tell your politicians to go [ __ ] themselves. And let me explain why.

The goal for every sovereign nation should be to make their citizens as rich as possible to compete in the world environment. And you say that to the politician. Isn't your goal to make us as rich as possible where we don't need to use government assistance so we're self-sufficient? We could pay our own things. Do you agree that that's a good thing? And if a politician says no to that, you just have to vote them out. Like, oh no, we're just going to give entitlements or whatever they call it in the UK. You have a you have a different word for it. What do you call that word? When they get benefits, we use use the word in America benefits is when you have a job, that's your health benefits. But in UK, you get benefits. Would it be better if we had less people on benefits? Yes. Okay. Let's get people Well, if people have no money, then they don't invest. No, you're you're you're not setting the goal the right way. It should be 50,000 and people 50,000. Well, I don't have 50,000. That's the goal for you to achieve to save and then you put into these accounts and then when you retire, you reap the rewards of that. That's the same way it works in America. It's so anyway. So, so with that, how many people we can ask chat GPT, but out of your friends or your circles, do most people have these accounts, the cash ISA and the stock and share Isa?

**James:**
Yeah, I'd say sort of most people have an ISA. Um I I wouldn't be able to tell you whether it's a stocks and shares one or a cash one, but that's how most people save. Um, so I don't know if they're saving for their first house or, you know, um,

**Grain :**
Well, no, no, hold on a second. If you're saving for your house in this, right, and you want to buy a house before you retire, when you when it comes out, do you pay taxes on it?

**James:**
No. No, really.

**Grain :**
So, in America, on a Roth IRA, you have to be, you know, past the age of 59. Let make sure I get this right. 59 and a half. Um, in America, you have to pay a penalty when it comes out. And then in a regular IRA account, you pay ordinary income taxes. So it's not the long-term.

**James:**
Yeah. So So this is differentiating an ISA from a SIP. A SIP or or is a self-invested pension plan. That's the same sort of idea as your IRA. Um but the ISER is an individual savings account. That's what it stands for. and it's a tax-free wrapper uh that allows people to either save um and gain interest taxfree or save by investing in stocks and shares.

**Grain :**
We could talk a lot about this, but the important takeaway for the people of the UK is to understand the um the rules and regulations or laws or how these are set up in order to take advantage of this. So I don't need to know any more detail than this but there are different types of these accounts and and what I will go back and what I told you before I've said this before the reason why and I I just say this now the the reason why that I am wealthy is that in America you have something called a 401k account that's sponsored by a company when you leave the company you can roll it into your individual retirement account the individual retirement account um has a limit with how much you can put in each year I think it maybe it's $6,000 per year in the US. I could look that amount, whatever it is. But when you work for a company, they do a match. So, right now, I believe it's about $20,000 a year. Your company can match. It's 25 grand a year. So, it comes out pre-tax. It goes into your IRA account. You can also do a Roth 401k if your company offers it. And then you roll that. Now, when the company runs it, they typically have very few stocks that you could buy in mutual funds, so people don't lose it all. Some companies like Cisco here in Silicon Valley, you can buy anything in your company 401k, any stock and buy options. You could do that, but that's an anomaly. Once you leave the company, this is the biggest hack ever and it's completely legal. Once you leave the company with the 401k, you roll it over into IRA. There's no taxable events with that. I'm not giving tax advice. There's no taxable events with this. And then you're an IRA account. You can buy any stock or any option or anything you want in it. And now you're free to choose. And so if you want to buy the MAG7 companies, you can buy that or you can buy Bitcoin Treasury companies. And I can buy the Smarter web company here in America. It trades OTC. And I get the advantage of buying in my tax-free account. What has first mover advantage in the UK, the Smarter Web Company, I can now buy that on the US exchange in US dollars. Now, some people said, "Well, would it be better if you could buy it in the UK exchange in pounds?" That's a little clunky because there has to be a currency conversion from dollars to pounds. It's just easier when they crosslisted on our exchange.

So, somebody asked this question, what's the difference between the Smarter Web Company, Smarter Web Company, SWC, and TSWCF, which is on the US exchange? Two different pools of capital.

Smarter Web Company trading on the UK exchange attracts UK people buying in British pounds. Awesome. But TSW TS WCF trades over the counter in the US with US people buying in US dollars in a different pool of capital in a different time zone. And so now all of a sudden this becomes interesting to me. Why do I like buying it? Well, I could just buy it in US dollars and it's the stock and and it's in my account ready to go and it doesn't trigger a taxable event for me in my IRA account, but I also bought in my brokerage account because I'm just that way. And so I have two different plans for the same piece. But going into this, so you said, why is this interesting to me? It's interesting to me because I get to see what's going on in the UK, but I get to buy it in the US. And same thing with with Metaplanet in Japan. I don't live in Japan and I don't have Japanese yet, but I want to be involved with what they're doing there. And so anyway, so go ahead. So that's how I see this is why this is so interesting.

**James:**
Yeah. And and and something you touched on there about different pools of capital and I'm tying together again something you said in a spaces a week ago. Um you know, moving from the pink sheets to the OTCQB um opens up a bigger pool of capital. Um, would that be the same if it moved to OTC QX?

**Grain :**
Yeah, let me tell you how important this is. The same thing happened with Grayscale Bitcoin Trust in the olden days, 2017. The same thing happened with GBTC. And the funny part was when I first bought it, it was $200 and went to $300 in two days. 300 if we're if people were like, "Oh, that's a penny stock." I'm like, "Well, it's $300 a share." Where did it end up at the end of the year? $3500 a share. And I'm not saying it's gonna have a smarter web company, but people like, "What do you mean there's a penny stock and it's trading at $3,500 a share?" They could not issue shares fast enough. They couldn't issue shares because they they had to have individual investors buy it to create the shares. And this is this is very very important.

The and I've been saying this and and this is uh um original for me. The most amount of money is made when the market is most inefficient.

The most amount of money is made when the market is inefficient. And what that means is, oh, the smarter web company does its IPO, comes out, Bitcoin Treasury, hits the market, it's brand new. All of a sudden, now it trades in the US and it's clunky. The stock goes up and down is very volatile because there's not enough shares in the OTC desk to bring over. And now the stock is going up and they're like, "Oh my god, you got these big swings." And I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, that's where I make the most amount of money." Like, "No, you want to be efficient." No, when it's efficient, I make I make squat. That arbitrage, the difference what's happening in in the UK and in America is very interesting to me. The arbitrage exists. Arbitrage is is looking at the inefficiency between the same thing in two different places. The arbitrage in 2017 was Grayscale Bitcoin Trust was arbitrageing the difference between securitized Bitcoin and native Bitcoin and they were the only game in town. And so the first mover advantage for the Smarter Web Company for me is I was like, "Wow, the UK people are going to go crazy about this. I got to buy this." I'm like there this this is like this is it's like 2017 all over. I'm not saying that smarter web comes like GBTC, but the arbitrage is I'm arbitrageing the difference and I don't play both and I'm not using computer trading. There's inefficiency in the market by taking those shares and putting the OTC in the US. I got to buy it. I just h that's the way I see it. And it's like you're a gen I'm not a genius. I've just been paying attention.

I mean, am I making sense? You tell me. I mean, think about it. You guys are buying it. I'm like, I love it. Buy it. Buy it. I'm buying it. I'll buy I'll probably buy more, right? But I have to The other thing is I don't have cash coming in. I don't have a I don't have a job. So, I have to sell something else to go buy it. Now, in the brokerage account, I'm going to trigger taxes. I'm like,

do I want to pay taxes on something I made a whole bunch of gains on? Or in the IRA account, it's like, which one's going to run faster? And then I pick the fastest raceh horse. It's not all or nothing.

So, but go ahead. Your next

**James:**
I I think this is great. I I'm very excited to talk to the UK people. Hopefully, they can understand my accent.

**Grain :**
Yeah, I think your your accent's pretty clear.

**James:**
Um, so the something else I I kind of wanted to touch on and get sort of an American uh, well, a knowledgeable American uh, input on is kind of options trading and things because at the moment it's not possible to options trade SWC as far as I'm aware. Um, you know, would that be a good thing for it? Would it be a bad thing?

**Grain :**
So would it be a good thing or bad thing? um it's inevitable

the market will always what they always want to do in order to track we talked about the pools of capital so as you go the up listing from the pink sheets to the gray sheets to the to the QX the highest status on on trading the OTC market um you attract different pools of capital and when you don't have a functioning uh way to do a carry trade whether that's I want to go long and short on the same PE on in the same stock. The Wall Street people want to make a risk-free return and pick whatever number that they pick 4% 8% 10% per year risk-free.

And they will look at that by saying, "Oh, I want to be able to go long and short, be delta neutral, do this." Obviously, they got to be a little bit positive or negative either way to to make that gain. So, your question is, is the option market is it good? It's inevitable. Now people like me, we like the distortions in the market. We remember that with GameStop or in look, Nvidia is down at a hundred bucks or under 100 bucks eight weeks ago. Then it retakes the all-time high is up 50% in eight weeks and it's one of the largest market cap companies in the world, right? Did I buy the options for that? No. Should I have? Yeah, probably.

So, you can make um you can multiply those returns. So someone like me where there's not enough volatility left in Bitcoin because Bitcoin's been trading sideways for whatever 8 eight weeks 10 weeks now I look for that volatility and I'm like oh I'm going to buy some of that and someone's like oh you went all I'm like no I didn't go all in I take a small position $100,000 and I'm like and and feel that's a lot of money. Now this is important in the options when I buy options I don't buy $100,000 in one position. They're like, "Oh, you don't?" I'm like, "Now, I could divide that up. I could divide that up. Let's say I divide up 10 different ways. I'll do 10 positions. I'll pick three expiration dates, right? And then I pick three different strike prices. Now I have nine positions. That's 90 $10,000 each. That's $90,000. And now I spread it out because I don't necessarily know which expiration and which strike is going to be the best return. So I divide that out. And so for me, do I like an options market on this? Yes. Do I think I'm going to make enough money on this where the option market, you know, when it comes out will be great? Sure. And then I'll see the track record as it as it trades. So, it's inevitable. It's going to attack larger pools of money, including my sell, but I want to see that option market get built out. I don't go long and short. I'm long only. If I'm not long, then I just don't buy it. I mean, if I don't think the price is going up, I don't buy. I don't shorten anything but anyway. Go ahead. So, I think that's the way look at the option market. It's inevitable. Whether it's good or bad depends upon if you're making money or losing money.

**James:**
I'm wondering what you would like to see SWC do going forward? Like what would make them exciting? What would make them stand out? um and and you know potentially be in the top I don't know few treasuries in the world.

**Grain :**
I I I think I think what we have seen what what the successful formula is is you have to have a charismatic CEO that's constantly out there publicly talking about this which is different than most corporate CEOs and the reason why is because because Bitcoin itself is a commodity because Sailor can talk non-stop as much as he wants about Bitcoin but he cannot talk at all pretty much about his stock price. can't if you if you watch all of his videos, he never talk and unless unless he's doing the metrics on his quarterly call, he never ever talks about uh strategy, their different prices for the different instruments that they offer, MSTR, strike, strife, and and and so forth. Uh so from that perspective, he can talk as much as he wants about Bitcoin. So you have to have a corporate CEO that that is uh fully bought into it is is on the talk show. They got to talk about it every day a little bit every day and and that that that takes a lot of effort. So what can they do? They have to be relentless about every day about oh this is Bitcoin. This is what we built. is going because they're trying to shift the mainstream traditional finance to believe that not only did Sailor do it for strategy and it's a hundred billion dollar company and and they they they will have eligibility for S&P 500. Whether or not they get it, who knows? Probably not, right? I don't I'm not banking on the fact that you're going to get it. But that is that that that non-stop talking about it. And a lot of corporate CEOs don't want to do that. Like I don't can't remember last time I heard Tim Cook talk about Apple. He does like one presentation a year, doesn't he?

**James:**
Yeah. It's like one presentation you never hear him talking anything about.

**Grain :**
And now Steve Jobs always did these great presentation. You can find 50 hundred Steve Jobs presentations. A thousand clips on on YouTube on Steve Jobs and he's charismatic. And some people would say, "Well, Steve Jobs can't write any code." You're like, "Yeah, you're right. He can't write any code." But he ran a brilliant company. He understood what people want. Look, I could tell you what people want. And and I I used to say this all the time when I worked in tech companies. I would show up there go, I know exactly what our customers want and what they care about. And people VPs, how do you know that? How do I know that? I go, once I tell you this, you're not g you're gonna be, oh my god, it was obvious. Customers care about themselves. People care about themselves. The first person that James Peg should care about is James Peg. First person that grain should think about is Grain, right? I care about myself. I care about my company. And I'm not going to do something I'm going to buy your product, whether it's Bitcoin or whatever we do based upon will it make my company money? Will will increase productivity? Will it reduce expenses? And I just say this in Silicon Valley all the time and I know I come across quite passionate today because I was fired up on a call last night, but I would tell people if our product that we're selling in Silicon Valley, okay, does not make the company money, does not increase productivity, does not reduce costs, they're not buying it. And they're like, "Oh, so Mr. VP in the executive briefing center because we're going to be there tomorrow talking to such and such customer. I can answer that. Do you have the conviction to answer that in 60 seconds? And they're like, Mike, you're a dick. And I'm like, no worries because the CEO gave me stock options and that's why I'm here and why I've never been unemployed. And so that's the reason why I maintain my job because I know the customers care about themselves first, which is the way it should be. James, you should care about yourself. You should care about your family. You should care about your fam and your friends first. That's who comes first in my That's who I think it is. And that's the way it is for me. I care about myself. I care about my family. And then I care about my friends and the community as as a whole. And so with that, that's what I looked for that they have to care about their company and they have to be relentless at pursuing that goal. And if they follow what Sailor did, the company's worth over hundred billion dollars. And he did. It was a zombie company. They coined the term a zombie.

He could have retired in obscurity, right? and he was a very he was a a billionaire at that point, right? He could have done that sailor, but anyway, we're almost he's two years older than I am, but he wanted a different path. So, we've been going on it's 32 minutes in. What What else you want to talk about?

**James:**
I guess uh the one last thing I kind of wanted to look at is um kind of convertible bonds and preferred stocks, right? because, you know, let's be honest, SWC are are running the sailor playbook. Um, and and he's the goat. But, um, you know, in my mind, it's it's too early for convertible bonds anyway for S SWC cuz uh the leverage would be too much.

**Grain :**
But hold on. So, keep on going. But, but that's the most important question. We we'll end after that question. But you've just asked the most important the people that are listening that made it to the 33 minute mark will hear the most important part about investing. Go ahead.

**James:**
So I'm wondering actually with uh the way the the industry or the the sector is going if it's best just to skip them out altogether. Um go straight to the preferred stocks. Um you know copy the solar playbook but but but skip that step. I know what do you think about that?

**Grain :**
So this is the inevitability. Why did I like the new companies that came out, the MetaPlanet, the smarter web company that came out? Because of as of right now, they're not easy to hedge. It's very hard to borrow those shares to sell it short. And for that means you get true price actions. The problem with the converts, so strategy has approximately $8 billion in converts. You can go to their website and look at it. They there's a column you look at the bottom they they column they they add up the column it's about eight billion dollars what happened with the converts and what we learned Richard Borthart people follow Richard Bworth that guy's a gem he's he's incredibly smart guy I'm not an investment banker and I'm not a bond guy but I am a stock guy and this is the most important part that you made it here 35 minutes in

those convertible bonds are delta hedge and what that means is not only do they give the billion dollars or hundred million ion dollar to strategy. Once they give the money, there's a bond and there's a conversion clause and in most cases there's no coupon rate, right? People like, oh, well, Strategy doesn't and and and they're non-colateralized, which is even crazier, right? So, they're non-colateralized and they typically don't pay a coupon. And Sailor borrowed money for no coupon, but then there tends to be a 35 to 40% conversion rate within five, you know, five years. Now sailor cannot force on many of those he cannot force the conversion.

Now the conversion may not be a taxable event but this is where the problem comes in. James you I I believe in the smarter web. You work in the smarter web company. I'm just a guy with a with a billion or a company with a billion dollars. So you do a convert. They give you a billion dollars and what you do is you then go buy the Bitcoin and the smarter web company. It's convertible B. It matures in five years. There's let's say a 40% uplift. Everything's great. I now go delta hedge that position because it's uncolateralized.

So what do I have to do? I have to buy puts to make sure that in the event that you guys go belly up, I don't lose a billion dollars. Right? So I delta hedge the position. Right? Now what happens is I got the long side of the bond and I got the short with the put and basically it kind of collars the stock and the collar is because you have an upside and a downside. The upside is a 40% convert but then I got the put against it also. So now you have to fight that resistance on both levels as the company. So, the convertible bonds,

is it good because you get the to buy to it's debt and you get to put on the balance sheet and you borrowed at a 0% coupon? Sure. But that that hedging is rough. And so, I like companies where they're not doing the converts yet because there's no hedging going on on it. It's pure price discovery. You get more volatility. So, that's very important to me. Now, it would be better if they had the equity styles like uh strike and strife. That would be better because from what I could tell, those are not delta hedge. And so, from from that perspective, I like this better. The converts unfortunately were a necessary thing that Sailor had to do and he built the market. I think now hindsight's 2020 with all this delta hedging. like you the other thing that I don't like right now is Misti because Misti is it took the buying pressure off of M and this is all aimed at the smarter web companies should learn from what happened. So Misti was built to have covered calls on MSTR stock and I'm very I'm very particular if I talk about strategy I talk about MSTR stock or strike or strike. So very particular for MSTR. So MSTR is a covered call strategy by YieldMax on that. So they have these synthetic positions. They have these covered calls on it. And what they do is they try to make a yield off of this. Now the problem is because that's the fund is at $4 billion. It tends to collar the price and so you need a bigger swing on Bitcoin to force it to break out. So that is a mature market. That's where they're looking to get these returns so-called

risk-free. I wouldn't consider Misti risk-free, but they want to have this risk-free returns. This idea that's a mature market where MSTR is now playing into it. It'll be five years in August. What I say at the very beginning of the call, you make the most amount of money when the market's most inefficient, which means is there's no option or derivatives market right now in the smarter web company. And that's where you have the price discovery and the volatility. Oh, the volatility is crazy. I'm like, "Yeah, because they can't hedge the positions." And that's where you tend to make the most money. Back in the old days in 2017, Bitcoin would move Bitcoin would move um it would move 20% down and 20% up, which would be a 40% swing in one day and everybody would be like, "Wow, right." And that was the volatility, but that volatility has been dampened because of IBIT and and options on iBit and and and doing this. So in so rounding out this whole conversation,

it's inevitable that's going to happen. But in the three months, six months, year till that happens, till the end of 2025,

no, I got I I've got large physicians, smarter web company, and these new these newer startups. I know they're not startups. Some of them that like Metaplanet have been around, but um that's what's exciting to me. And I think the takeaway from this phone call is people have to understand that the UK versus the US, I'm buying into my pool of capital in the US and US dollars. And that's interesting to me. It's interesting to you because it's your native play in the UK. It's your own company, homefield advantage. There's always

**James:**
Right. Right. Thank you very much for coming on. Um it's been a pleasure to meet you and and and to chat to you. Um, where can people find your ex if if they want to follow you?

**Grain :**
Yeah. So, so, um, a grain grain of salt, it's at Z06 or Z06 Z07.

It's a Corvette thing. I had a Corvette Z06.

And so, or Z06 if we're speaking in the Queen's English. And so, um, and then I it had a Z. I'm a car guy, so any any car guy will get what it was. It's the worst handle to have, but I really can't change it now because so many people know it. So anyway, that's where you can find me on X. Um, I'm on spaces. Jump on. Um, you can't you can't DM me unless I follow you. But if for some reason someone wants to talk to me and I don't follow you, you could always go to James or somebody else and they'll get to me if you have a direct question. But the more important thing is if you want me to do a space and James do a space live, reach out to us and then we'll do a live space and we'll take questions live. I'm always up for a space.

**James:**
Okay, cool. Thank you very much, Green. Thank you. Take care. Have a great day.
