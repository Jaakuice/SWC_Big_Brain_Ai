A North Korean hacker group is being blamed for a hack that took down a UK cryptocurrency exchange. Thailand is opening crypto payments to tourists. Amsterdam based crypto firm AMD has announced the launch of a Bitcoin treasury business and the latest on Adam's Bitcoin treasury moves. All that and much more. Plus, we have Andrew Webbley with us today, CEO of the Smarter Web Company, and Borja Martel Seward, CEO of Roxom. That's all coming up right now on the Roxom Report.

**Ioney Butler:**
(0:00:49) [Intro] Welcome to today's episode of the Roxson Report. Today is Monday the 18th of August 2025. I'm your host Ioney Butler. Right now, Bitcoin is trading at $115,41. So, it's a shame to see it down. It's gone down a little bit over the week weekend. Uh but right now, we're joined by Andrew Webbley, CEO of um the Smarter Web Company. We were supposed to have another guest on earlier, but they uh unfortunately uh were weren't able to make it. Um but Andrew um founded the Smarter Web Company in 2009 after serving as head of online at Hargraves Landdown. He has over 25 years of experience in internet web development and digital marketing. Since 2023, he has positioned his uh profitable web services business as the UK's first Bitcoin treasury company, adopting a strategy of accepting Bitcoin payments and holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Under his leadership, the company listed on the Aquis Stock Exchange in April 2025, evolving rapidly from a modest valuation into a high-profile public company spotlighted for its bold Bitcoin ccentric growth strategy. Andrew, welcome to the show. How are you?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:02:03) I'm good, thank you. And you?

**Ioney Butler:**
(0:02:05) Very good. Excited to talk to you. Thank you for joining me.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:02:07) No problem.

**Ioney Butler:**
(0:02:08) Um we're also joined by Borja Mattel Seward who is the co-founder of Roxom and Roxom TV. Uh Borja, how are you today?

**Borja Martels:**
(0:02:23) Hey Andrew, how are you? I hope that everything is very well and thank you for coming. uh the community and everybody's very excited about this uh about this thing of you of of us having you here. So now let's have a great time and and talk a lot about uh SWC uh the one of the largest Bitcoin treasury companies in the world right now.

**Ioney Butler:**
(0:02:43) I only so we're very lucky to have an today a great guest um Borja and I are going to be joint hosts today which is new but fun we're both excited to talk to you um so first up I would love to hear a little bit about um your career trajectory and sort of how and when you discovered Bitcoin and how they uh have kind of moved together over the years?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:03:09) Yeah, sure. So, I started my career in 1999. I joined a very small company which became one of the biggest companies in the UK, Hargreaves Lansdown. Um, so I did that for 10 years. Um, and then I decided to leave HL and being a developer, I wanted to build a system which I could then build a business around. So, I built a content management system which is the same system that we use today to design and build and host websites for our clients. We think it's a very good system, very easy to use, you know, very affordable. Um, and then it got to about almost 10 years ago and I found Bitcoin. Um, and being honest, you know, when I first found it, the significance of Bitcoin didn't quite click. I thought it was a volatile asset, you know, good medium of exchange, these sorts of things.

**Ioney Butler:**
(0:03:51) How did you find it? Did somebody tell you about it or?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:03:53) Yeah, I can't remember the finer points about how I I found it. And the only thing I can really remember is that it was really hard to buy at the time. It was before the big exchanges, you know. So what I used to do is I used to have to buy it and then I used to have to send the money um through the bank which was actually easier than it is some of the time today to send it and then you used to get it to I used to use use an online wallet at the time. Um you know completely crazy compared with what it is now. Um I think it was 2017 something like that.

**Ioney Butler:**
(0:04:23) Okay.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:04:25) Um, but for me the the defining moment was, you know, going back to my time at HL, you know, I was I was very sort of clued up on the public markets and I'd been investing sometimes well, sometimes not so well. And the moment for me was when Michael Sailor came out with Micro Strategies, Bitcoin adoption. Um, and they basically took a public company and Bitcoin, smashed the two together. Um, and for me that was, you know, that was like a lightning moment. You know, it was it was just the best thing ever. Um, and that's when the significance really really clicked. Um, you know, so going back to, you know, the Smarter Web Company, you know, we've always been profitable. Um, you know, we've always enjoyed it. We've got lots and lots of good clients, over 250 clients. Um, you know, it's a good business, just a small business. Um, but what I what I decided was that I wanted to invest in a UK version of Strategy. Um, and there wasn't one, not one that I could find. Um, so this is about two and a half, three years ago, however long it was. Um, and I kept looking every single day trying to find a company that I could invest some of my money in. Um, because I I still hold strategy today. In fact, I bought some more this morning. Um, but I I I I just wanted a UK version of it. You know, there's there's lots of reasons why, you know, that's the right thing in my opinion for someone to want. Um, and I couldn't find it. And then, you know, fast forwarding to last year, um, shortly after the summer, you know, I still couldn't find it. Um, so I decided, you know, probably end of Q3, start of Q4, that I would list my own business. Um, and, you know, here here we are today. We we we started work on that sort of December properly in January. You know, we listed in April this year. Um, you know, I must admit at the time, you know, everyone thought that I was mad. you know, all the people in the city, they didn't they didn't think there was any anything that could be done, even though I was saying to them, look at strategy, look at MetaPlanet. You know, one of our directors is on the board of MetaPlanet, you know, it's it's there for everyone to see.

**Ioney Butler:**
(0:06:21) Do you think they didn't they they thought that it was such a crazy idea just because of the regulatory landscape in the UK?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:06:26) I'm not sure whether it is so much on the regulatory side. I think the English attitude to I I think the UK capital markets have had such a torrid time for however long it is, 10, 15 years. Um, and I don't think that they they they could see the opportunity to generate capital to do something like this. You know, we've raised um it's probably, you know, give or take around about 200 million pounds, you know, um probably a little bit more than that to be fair. Um or actually maybe slightly less, but call it 200 million pounds. We raised 200 million pounds in three and a half months. M um and and I just don't think that they they could see the you know they could see the potential. You know, obviously, you know, I could see it. You know, we're still tiny compared with where I want us to be. Um but they just didn't really they didn't really get it. You know, the people on on the whole. Um and then what we did is we wanted to approach it differently to most public companies. So, you know, it's it's a business that I founded. I care about it. I often say that I've got two kids and this is like the one in the middle, you know, so three kids. Um and and and so we wanted to do it, you know, with with hard work, with transparency, with integrity. You know, everyone's seen how hard we've worked as a team so far, you know, to try and get to where we are today. Um and and I think that's one of the reasons why people have supported it because they like the fact that we care about it, you know, we we care about what we're doing. It means something to us. Um you know, and we've done it.

**Ioney Butler:**
(0:08:00) Okay. So far, absolutely. Um, so I'm fascinated because that you you said that you kind of had this idea around Q3. Uh, it's I speak to a lot of guests who have Bitcoin related businesses and a lot of them have found that since um Trump won uh the presidency and his got his sort of pro- Bitcoin crypto stance, it's given a lot of people uh the space to grow and develop their businesses knowing that there's guidelines and rules and it's been really beneficial. But you kind of were deciding to do this before that and obviously that's the the US and we're in the UK and it's different but I think it's quite bold and brave. Did it feel like that for you or is it like nope this is a good time to do it. I want to do it. It's been done before. Was were there any concerns that you had about doing this in the UK with where we're at?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:08:51) Yeah. So in 2023 um we put on our website that we will accept Bitcoin as payment. Um and that was really hard for me to do. Um, you know, it took me months to actually finally pluck up the courage to put that on our website because when you're marketing a service to small to medium-sized businesses, um, you don't want to scare them when they're potentially, you know, dealing with you. Um, that was a really hard decision and that was only what, two years ago. Um, so when we decided to list the business, I didn't have any doubt in my mind. Um, no doubt, zero doubt. Um, and I think part of the reason why I didn't have any doubt was I believe that even in the last 18 months, Bitcoin's transformed into something that it probably wasn't perceived as, you know, 18 months ago, two years ago, in terms of the, you know, the adoption. you know, all I saw last year um coming out of the US, which is, you know, one of the main places that I invest in terms of public markets, um was, you know, the sort of the big money managers over there, you know, whether it's your Black Rocks or, you know, Strive or these people saying, you know, you should have an X% allocation to Bitcoin in your portfolio. So, you know, I've never seen anything as clearly as this in my whole life. Um, of course, I may be wrong. Um, but I I had no doubt. Um, and funnily enough, my wife, who was, you know, a 50% shareholder of the Smarter Web Company with me, um, and we obviously, you know, converted those shares into Smarter Web Company shares when, um, you know, when we did the transaction, um, you know, she had no doubt either. Um, so, um, so, so yeah, two years ago when deciding to accept it as a medium of payment, um, it was a big deal for us. um you know but the IPO you know absolutely no doubt doubt whatsoever.

**Ioney Butler:**
(0:10:42) Yeah. Um Borja I'm going to hand over to you. Do you want to um have you have some questions for Andrew?

**Borja Martels:**
(0:10:48) Yes of course. Um first off I'd like to start uh with a disclosure. Um because we have to I'm a shareholder in the smarter web and and as we always say none of what we talk about here is financial advice. Andrew, um my qu my initial kickoff question for you is um the job that you've been doing, the work that you've been doing so far is absolutely incredible. I think that well I think no the data is that uh you with MetaPlanet are the fastest growing uh treasury companies in in the world today. And for everybody that is that is um watching this right now and actually when we posted this we said like hey what what would you like us to to ask Andy um one of uh Andrew one of the um the the best uh or the most asked things was how are we what's what's the plan to uh maintain this incredible rhythm that that you've got honestly it's uh it's it's amazing actually this is something funny but um I showed some of my friends um in more or less every March April in May May 15th when the company was still at 30 40 million pounds uh market cap I was uh showing your company to to my friends and now seeing it close to a billion is insane. So what's the plan um to maintain this rhythm in the UK and how much adoption do you see of most probably the instruments that you must be designing fixed income and so on. how how do you see the landscape in the UK um to absorb uh all all of the liquidity that you want to get?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:12:31) Yes. So, you know, the the way that we've done it is probably the way to start. So, if you want to run a Bitcoin treasury company, you need to start it in the right way. Um you know, and and and and we did that. you know, we we we involved retail investors. You know, we we started at a a smallish amount and we grew it fairly fairly quickly and fairly fairly frequently. Um, and that's how you do it to compound the Bitcoin yield. Um, and to, you know, give the performance, you know, like we've seen the the reality of what you've got with a Bitcoin treasury company is you need increasing larger and larger amounts of capital. Um so so the question here is um you know how are you going to do that? So take MetaPlanet as a good example you know which I also bought some more shares of on Friday. Um the the way you do it is that you um you demonstrate to the people that provide the capital that you are delivering a compound Bitcoin strategy i.e. producing a yield bitcoin per share increase whatever you want to call it. Um, so you know before I came to the interview today, I've been meeting with investors. You know, I've spent a lot of time over the last couple of weeks meeting with different investors in different parts of the world. Um, I've got an awful lot of meetings planned in the diary, even going two months into the future. So that's constant. Um, and and the purpose of those meetings is, you know, fairly obviously is to generate capital, the right capital. So that capital can be done in lots of different ways. So, you know, as everyone knows, people can buy our equity, you know, with it within a raise within, you know, the market. You know, if they buy it within the market, they might be buying from somebody selling the shares. They might be buying effectively from our ATM on an update. So, that's another thing we do. We've also got something that we announced about two weeks ago called Smarter Convert. Now, that's the first, as far as I'm aware, Bitcoin denominated bond that the UK's ever seen. Um, we've got other things which I'm not allowed to talk about which we're exploring for the future in addition to the medium to long-term goal of having preference shares when we get, let's say, 10 times, maybe a little bit bigger. Um, that's something that's very, very important, but it's not a today thing. You know, there's a cost to providing those products. The market needs to be a bit more mature until you can do that. Um I think the other angle that you know being completely transparent with everyone that people need to look at is that as you get bigger those capital raising announcements that you make may get more frequent sometimes they may get smaller and they may get bigger. So it's not a straight line. It's not a case of you raise 2 million then 4 million then 8 million then 16 32 64 so on and so forth. you know, as as you get to a certain point, you know, the next rays may be smaller or it may may come from a different instrument or they may be more frequent. Um, if you look at our company, you know, we're still, you know, at 76% or whatever the number is over the last 30-day period. We're still almost doubling the Bitcoin per share over that 30-day period. So, it's still pretty impressive. Um, but you know, as long as you can keep that, you know, at a decent level over many, many months, aka what MetaPlanet can do. Um, you know, that's the sort of thing you should look for. The the the trick with it all, I suppose, um, is is is is looking at that profile and and, you know, our investors saying, do they believe that we can continue the progress that we've got? And, you know, that's that's where the work comes in. you know, we work very very long days um trying to get everything done. You know, if you look at um which I appreciate no one can see, you know, what I'm doing at the moment compared with a month ago, it's busier. You know, the Bitcoin per share is greater. You know, the share price is lower. So, you've got all these different dimensions that you need to factor in. But, I've never been as confident about what we're doing as I am right now. Um and I'm very much looking forward to the next couple of weeks and months.

**Borja Martels:**
(0:16:37) Amazing. Um, thank you so much for the for the context and for the answer. And my follow-up question will be this is something very uh very of this particular moment. So, Andrew, as as you know, like we've been we've we've gone up from 110 to 115 to 124. Um, actually we did the alltime high 123, then we went down again. We did alltime high last week. Um, and now we're hovering at 115. Despite of this um Bitcoin treasury companies as a whole uh we've been bleeding uh that's the truth. Um the last couple of weeks even though uh Bitcoin has been doing performing well um our sector like the Bitcoin company sector I say our as as an investor we've been bleeding. So what's your analysis on this? Um is uh the market getting more rational uh about the multiples like what what's your take? What's your view? you talk with investors and and and with people raise you're raising money every single day. Um what's what's your analysis?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:17:39) Yeah. So one thing that I've noticed over the last three and a half months in my new life speaking to institutional investors frequently is that the the the the understanding of the the UK institutional investors is is way greater than it was three and a half months ago. you know, you you go into the room now and and they they look at you like you've got something that they can really learn from. Three and a half months ago, I think that they thought, you know, who the hell's this person from Bristol that's turned up into the office, you know? Um so so that's different. Uh when I was sat on the the the train just pulling into London this morning, um I got sent an email from um a big broker, Peel Hunt, um in the UK. They've actually produced their first, I believe, um you know, piece of research. It's over 30 pages long about Bitcoin treasury companies. You know, we're in there. You know, obviously Strategy, Meta Planet, etc. Um, so that's really really beneficial. You know, you're also right, of course, about the the recent action in terms of the Bitcoin price. You know, I believe Bitcoin is looking incredibly strong at the moment. I can't wait to see where it ends the year. I believe it'll be significantly higher. And of course, you're right about Bitcoin Treasury companies that, you know, it's been a tough what, five weeks, six weeks, however long it's been. Um, we believe that the cycles that we've all seen for many, many years in Bitcoin are similar but much more compressed in Bitcoin treasury companies. You know, we we we joke sometimes internally that Bitcoin used to be the most volatile asset and now it's Bitcoin treasury companies. You know, clearly volatility is a good thing. Um, you know, the volatility is the thing that gives you the performance. You know, I think if you wanted to single out a few of the reasons why, you know, we're having a tough time as an industry at at the moment, you would probably go down to things like, you know, of course it's August. Um, you know, I will be massively surprised if by the early part of September, everyone isn't saying, why didn't I buy a load of, you know, Smart Web, Metanet, whatever. um you know in in August when it was on sale or or or whatever it is at the moment. Um I think that's one thing. I think the other thing um that you're seeing globally is you're seeing a lot more new a lot more new entrance come out. Um I chuckle to myself a little bit when I look at the you know the sort of the new entrance. I hold um six soon to be seven maybe eight Bitcoin treasury companies globally um plus Smarter Web. Um, Smarter Web is the only one that I hold in the UK. Um, and and and when I look at some of the new entrance, you know, I I find it fascinating. Look at how they've structured it and how they've got their um their their capital devised in terms of how they're going to then deliver future Bitcoin yield. Um, because if they can't deliver that, then it's a fairly pointless exercise. Um so I think that competition um is is quite interesting at the moment and that's clearly you know sort of sucking up some of the you know the the trading mentality in terms of right you know everyone can see what our share price has done the bit that people forget is that our share price has gone from X to Y and then back down to you know wherever um but it's still significantly up and because of how we used capital raising over the period and are still using it we are underlying the value of the business with our assets um you know which everyone can see they can work out the nav if in fact they can see it on our website on the analytics page um so that return through the way that we've used the capital markets has been locked in for all intents and purposes as long as you believe in the value of Bitcoin of course um whereas you know so it's not like it's it's gone out of control and there's no substance behind it there clearly is substance in terms of the nav um So, I I think all of those sorts of things are are interesting, but the thing that I say to everyone, especially my friends when I'm talking to them about investing in Bitcoin or Bitcoin treasury companies is they need to do their research and they need to understand volatility. You know, volatility on the way up, everyone loves, volatility on the way down, not so much.

**Ioney Butler:**
(0:21:51) Indeed. And sorry Ioney my last question and and then I pass it to you uh Andrew is it's uh two questions in one. So today you are um

**Borja Martels:**
(0:22:06) number 24 in terms of public uh company with the amount of bitcoin holdings that you have naturally biggest treasury company's strategy with with almost 630,000 uh bitcoins. You're 24 with uh 2 almost 2400. What's your long-term target? Like are you targeting to be one of the 10 largest uh treasuries in in the world and and and and so on like that would be in what's your target in terms of of size not in amount of bitcoins but in in compared to other companies. And my second my follow-up question to that or it could be prior uh is what's your biggest opportunity that you what do you feel or or believe it's your biggest opportunity for and the biggest opportunity for a smarter web uh understanding your context and your everything?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:23:05) Yes. So um we could do the questions in order. So, in our in our deck and in our investor communications, we clearly state that we would like to own 1% at least 1% of all the Bitcoin that there will ever be. Um, I think it was two weeks ago, maybe two and a half weeks ago, we got to 1% of 1% of all the Bitcoin, you know, 2,100. Um, you know, we or or I certainly, and this is, you know, therefore we as in the company, um, believe in continuous improvement. Um so so just in the way that strategy don't have you know formal targets of you know I'm going to get X by Y. Um you know we we've said to people we're ambitious we're trying to grow you know I think we are one of the fastest growing Bitcoin C treasury companies if not the fastest in the world right now. Um so as long as we can keep improving and you know running faster training harder than everyone else I think I'll be quite happy. Um, you know, of course we do want to get to that target. Getting to that target. The big thing there is the capital side of things. And that's not just how good we are at raising capital. That's also how receptive that wider capital. So maybe property as an example, debt, you know, even gold, you know, which is the immediate target to overtake the market cap of gold, you know, do a 10x and then we'll be there. um you know so so so not everything's in our control what is in in our control is how hard we can work to get there um so you know I think we'll be considerably higher in terms of the number of bitcoin that we hold in quite a short space of time you know so by the end of the year I have talked about some numbers but we haven't got a formal target you know the next thing that's clearly in my sights right now is getting to 4,200 bitcoin i double the target that we had before you What we did recently is we, you know, we went from 2,100 to almost 2,400. So, approximately a 10% gain. You know, it doesn't take it shouldn't take that long to get to that that number. So, we just want to keep going and going and going, you know, and then um and then go further from there.

**Ioney Butler:**
(0:25:16) Thank you. Thank you, Andrew. Ioney to you.

**Ioney Butler:**
(0:25:23) Yeah. Yeah. Thanks, Borja. I had some follow-up questions from some of those things that you were talking about. you'd mentioned um seeing some of the uh other companies that are kind of consider considering getting into the game. Do you from your experience have you kind of seen are there ways that you feel like a a safer smarter way of doing it and perhaps things to avoid doing? Do you have kind of any uh thoughts on that?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:25:41) Yeah, I think I think the most sensible thing is um well a doing the right thing and you know treating everyone equally. Um so you know I'm a retail investor and I believe that everyone should be treated you know everyone should have the same access wherever possible. So I think that's quite important. Um the the the other thing that I would say if if you wanted to do the strategy is you know I'd probably say don't bother at the moment in terms of a pure Bitcoin strategy in the UK because I think we're doing quite well and think it'd be quite difficult to catch up with that. Um but if you really did want to do it then I would say you know get your numbers right in the first point you know maybe start with I don't know 5 million pounds then go for 10 then 20 you know those milestones that I talked about what you have to remember with a Bitcoin treasury company is that anyone can raise money at the outset you know on a 1xmnav it's very very easy um the trick is being able to get say through three four five capital raises and show the investors that you're delivering to allow those new investors to put in that money on those multiples at those higher levels. Um, and that goes back to the treating everyone fairly point of view as well. Um, you know, if I if I was, you know, where I was say two years ago and and I had the UK in front of me or or the world in fact at the moment, you know, I probably wouldn't have done it. you know, I would have picked, you know, the companies that I've actually picked anyway, um, and invested in those because, you know, you've got a lot of choice. Um, I think the other bit of advice I'd give someone is is say, you know, if you if you really do want to do it, then, you know, you need to be prepared to work. Um, you know, there's a lot of work that goes into it. you know, the the the the capital raising, the communication, you know, all the the boring bits behind the company that that people don't see but are absolutely essential. You know, there's a lot of paperwork with running a public company. Uh clearly, we've got a reasonable team with some really great advisers, but you know, just be mindful, you know, it's not it's not all sort of, you know, speaking to great people like yourselves. You know, there's a lot of other things that go into this. um you know and and and I think if you're going to do it for the long term you know many many years you have to be very aware of that um because at the end of the day if if you're doing something and people are deciding to invest their hard-earned money with you um then you need to make sure that you can deliver for them or at least try your best to deliver for them.

**Ioney Butler:**
(0:28:16) Absolutely. It seems like once you kind of move forward you can't just take the your foot off the gas. You kind of have to keep you know moving and growing. So to your point of hard work and yeah, you know, it's not all sunshines and rainbows. You're going to you're going to be you're going to be focused on this for a good while.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:28:28) Well, it actually gets quicker as well. So it's not just taking your foot off the gas. It's you know, the pedal goes faster. Um you know, the um you know, if I think about myself, for example, um you know, we went on a holiday um which I booked from before we did the thing. I told a few people that I was going on holiday. The diary got full um over in Abu Dhabi. Um, lucky I've got an understanding family, so you know, they're all fine. They enjoy seeing me happy and they know that, you know, the company's very important to me, just as they're very important to me. Um, and, you know, it's it's, you know, even even a month ago, we're way busier than we were then. You know, we've got some great hires that we'll be able to talk about soon, which are going to, you know, give us that capacity to get to that next level up as well. you know, we've got um you know, Jesse, everyone knows, you know, on the the live streams, you know, who who joined us a few months ago now. Um you know, there's there's there's a lot that that that it takes to, you know, keep pushing it forward every single day.

**Ioney Butler:**
(0:29:29) Do you think you were ready for it? I mean, because obviously there's certain things that you need to put in place, but did it kind of catch you by surprise a little bit? Has it has it been kind of work to keep up or did you like, right, we're going to we know we need to grow and

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:29:41) Yeah, not not really. So we we we planned everything. We got everything in place. Even some of the things that you know are being asked of us today, we we had them in place way before we listed, you know. Um so you know when I was at Hargreaves Lansdown, you know, we listed that business on the stock market. I was part of the team that did it. I wasn't the one responsible for it but part of the team. So you know I I was very aware what happens in a private company that becomes a public company and you know the the addition additional you know compliance governance call it what you will that you have to go through. So you know some of the very very first things that we did way before we started thinking about raising money um were those things you know to make sure that we were geared up for it. um you know being being completely honest with you um did I think it would go up you know 100 200x you know you know whatever it did you know from from the the start to the highest point um no I didn't think it would do that in the first couple of months um you know it's great because it allowed us to underpin that by using capital raising strategies at all those different points but I think anyone that said that they were expecting that was either sort of pretty pretty ambitious even more so than me um you or or maybe not telling the truth, but um I'm pretty pleased about everything that we've got in place and I'm really pleased about the things that we're putting in place for the the future of the company where we're heading right now as well, which you know we'll be able to talk about soon.

**Ioney Butler:**
(0:31:06) Excellent. How much um with so would you say like what is is there a percentage of the company focus on the Bitcoin treasury uh and the company focus on the smarter web like the under underpinning business? What what is what would you kind of say the the ratio is there?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:31:23) Um I wouldn't probably say there's a ratio there because it's different people doing different things. Got it. Um so I'm really lucky that you know Alex who I've worked with for 15 years you know is the key person in the operating business. Um there's a new person that's joining him on I think it's about two weeks time. Um which is going to be great there. Um, and then you've got other people like Jesse, for example, who has a very limited amount of dealings with the operating business, but is far more weighted to, you know, the Bitcoin treasury side of what we're doing. So, and then in terms of my time, my time is as the CEO is is overseeing the elements of the business. Clearly there's a lot more attention on the financing side of things and the strategy which you know is obviously the Bitcoin treasury side but I do a fair bit of work in terms of pointing them in the right direction on the operating business side um as we grow and grow and grow. I'm quite keen um you know to keep a hands-on approach because you know I love so many bits of you know what we do and and you know you know if if anything my only complaint now is I haven't got very much time at all although I did do some at the weekend um to do any programming um because I I you know I enjoy the work um so yeah the best way of thinking about it is you have different people for different different things and then as it grows um you know you'll have other people you know for whatever whatever the business needs needs.

**Ioney Butler:**
(0:32:49) I imagine that the publicity from all of this has has helped in some way or boosted drawn a lot of attention to the smarter web company and that and the operating business. Have you seen like a increase in attention for th those services?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:33:02) Yeah. So, so I have to be careful about what I can talk about in terms of numbers. Okay. Um but in terms of the visibility, I I you know going back to what I said about like our market cap, it grew quicker than I was expecting. I expected the inquiries to grow quicker than they have. Um, you know, because 3 4 months in, they're just starting to look pretty good. You know, normally August is a quiet time for us. It's actually a really good time at the moment on the operating business. Um, that's really unusual. Um, you know, so, you know, one thing grew a lot quicker, the other thing has grown slower. Um, I'm really excited to see where we take the operating business over the next say 12 months or so because, you know, whilst no one really talks about it, the great thing about having a profitable operating business is that you can offset the PLC costs that you've got so that there isn't any capital that needs to be raised in the future to cover those PLC costs. So if you can be a profitable operating business, you know, with a treasury policy and in time an acquisition strategy, you've got something really quite cool there. Um, and then that takes us nicely on to where I see us being in, you know, whether it's, you know, and this isn't a projection, by the way, but three years, 5 years, 10 times when we're hopefully positioned as almost like the bank of the future, i.e. a business with a really strong balance sheet that may be building things on top of the Bitcoin network may have acquired different businesses doing X Y or Zed um and that side of things. So, um yeah, it should be quite exciting the next few years, I bet.

**Ioney Butler:**
(0:34:34) And um I'm curious with the does it feel like you're the the CEO of of one of these companies and you've got MetaPlanet and strategy and everything. Is it like have you have you spoken to Michael Sailor for example? Have have you been given advice? Is it like a kind of a do you have like an accountability group with these guys? You know, you've all kind of going through the same experiences. Have they been quite helpful reaching out to help guide you in any way?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:34:56) Yeah. So, Michael Sailor's been very very kind to us. Um, you know, I can't remember when, but he reached out to me and I I I was meant to meet him somewhere, but you know, I couldn't get there. So, then he messaged me about a week after, I think, and you know, we met in London and he was really helpful. you know, I was I was I was really grateful that he spent the time to talk to us, not so much about what he's done, right, because we all know that, but some of the things that he would change. Um, so that was great. Um, I'm very lucky in the sense that, you know, I've I've I've met or I know um speak to some of them more, some of them less. Um, you know, the sort of the people globally doing the same strategy in other countries. Um, Alex from Capital B, he's been very good. I I actually met him a couple of weeks ago. We had lunch. Um it was a bit awkward because you know I I obviously without giving him anything inside I said that you know it's highly likely that in the next few days we're going to overtake you and the Bitcoin Treasury holdings thing and I just wanted to let you know like I hold shares in their company as well. I just wanted to let you know that you know I I don't want you to take this the wrong way. You know I really respect what you're doing. we're in a different, you know, jurisdiction and, you know, I I am a shareholder and then I think I bought some more shares in it just to sort of reinforce the point. Um,

**Ioney Butler:**
(0:36:19) does it matter? Do you think it matters if like somebody has more than

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:36:22) No.

**Ioney Butler:**
(0:36:23) Yeah. But you just wanted to kind of, you know,

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:36:26) I think I can't speak for everyone else. Um, but from my side of things, as long as people are doing things in the right way and they're treating other people, you know, with respect, um, then, you know, anything that anyone else does makes us all stronger because ultimately you're you're buying Bitcoin hopefully forever. Um, and that's reducing the longerterm supply um, and is increasing the adoption. Um, so I think it's a positive thing. I, you know, my view is that you'll have, you know, one, maybe two, maybe three, you know, in in bigger markets, companies doing the strategy, but you'll have everyone else holding Bitcoin because it's the best thing to hold rather than, you know, property, gold, pounds, whatever. Um, but that's not to be confused with people that are pursuing an active Bitcoin accumulation strategy, um, where there'll be less in in in my opinion. Um, but no, I I think it's great. You know, I'm I'm um I'm looking forward to the day when there's another company that I would like to invest in in the UK and I'd happily support them.

**Ioney Butler:**
(0:37:21) Incredible. Borja, did you have a question for Andrew?

**Borja Martels:**
(0:37:26) Yes, Andrew. Um naturally um Bitcoin Treasury companies uh need to become experts in fundraising. Your company is one of the few that has actually got uh gotten the the flywheel up and running in a in a very strong way. My question for you is regarding the team. At the end of the day, this fundraising machine and this flywheel is made and executed by people, by a team. Um, I would love to to ask you for everybody that is watching this, we currently have like roughly 500 people on X watching this. Um, what's the outlook on the team? Are you currently looking for any additional uh team members? Um right now the blockchain group for example has just hired a new uh uh Bitcoin strategy analyst. So they have their head of Bitcoin strategy and now a new analyst who's I guess is going to be participating in the whole process. Um what is your outlook on on your team? Uh I imagine that you must be very happy because you guys have raised 200 million pounds uh and and and and counting. Um but what's your outlook on on the near future and and yeah if you could just tell us more about uh the team that you're building which so far is amazing.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:38:49) So um I have to be a little bit careful about how I can answer that question. Um so we um so we've we've we've got someone um in no particular order here. Um we've got somebody joining the company I believe on the 8th of September. Um that's going to be somebody to work next to me. um someone called Laura. Um she's going to be my executive assistant and she's going to mean that I can spend more time doing the things that shareholders probably want me to do. Um so less, you know, planning my travel, you know, meetings, chasing people up, you know, she can assist me with that. So that will be great. Um we've got a marketing manager starting in the operating business. Um they are starting, I believe, on the 1st of September. um and they should be able to help drive that side forward uh alongside Alex um and the other people to really get that one one going. Um we've got another person um who I'm hoping will start before the end of the year um doing a specific role which I can't talk about. Um and then we've got another person again that I cannot talk about um who will be starting very very very soon. Um, and I think that will really give people um some color of where we're heading on that side of things and and why this person's joining and you know their their background and so forth. Um, so that's um four new people um in 2025. Um there's another person that we're also recruiting for at the moment which will take it to uh one more of course. Um so that that's that's quite a big increase in terms of you know the team members you know roughly a 50% increase in terms of you know the headcount before those those roles to to after and I I don't know whether we will need any more people in 2025 than that. Um I think a business like this ignoring the operating side will never need dozens and dozens of people. It's not that sort of thing. What it needs is it needs the very very best people for the the the various different bits that they're doing in the company to be properly worldclass, which is why it's taken me a little bit of time to find the people that are joining us. Um because, you know, I do have quite high standards on that side of things. Um and I don't want to get somebody if I'm not convinced that they're going to be right for the long term because, you know, this is all about the long-term um future of of the company. Um so yeah, that's a that's a brief overview if that answers the question.

**Ioney Butler:**
(0:41:15) Oh, amazing. Thank you. And uh just to um say something, this is no none of this is forward-looking comments. Uh just uh throwing this out as as well as none of this is financial advice.

**Borja Martels:**
(0:41:28) Andrew, um for you in your very long-term uh strategic positioning for the smarter web and so on, I I have two questions. What role do you believe that Bitcoin treasury companies will fill in in the future? Again, the other day we're talking and some people say that they will be the the banks of the future and and there's different comments. What's your analysis? What's your understanding? What what are the Bitcoin Treasury companies going to do in the future and what's the role going to be for you and what how do you envision the smart web positioned uh there?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:42:08) Okay. So, so broadly speaking, that's what I believe that Bitcoin treasury companies will be the banks of the future. And I don't mean by that like the banks. Um, I just mean incredibly well- capitalized businesses that are potentially quite diverse. Um, you know, built on a very very strong balance sheet that's built on the best asset in the world. So, that's what I mean when I say about that. Now, when we did the IPO, I was in New York as a on a family holiday. Um, I've told people this story before. Um, it's the best way of describing it, I think. Um, I was at the bottom of the Rockefeller Center looking at the model before I went up it. Um, and it struck me then that, you know, what happened approximately a 100 years ago in New York was the same opportunity that we've got today where, you know, back then it was a land grab of prime real estate in New York. uh and they built these fantastic businesses that are still as good today, if not better, because they're more more iconic. Um and and and going going to, you know, our current time is exactly the same in my eyes in terms of Bitcoin. It's a it's a Bitcoin grab um to build something that will last 100, 200, 300 years into the future. Um so that's that's the way that I think about it. If you look at the people that built those buildings a 100 years ago, they became the investment banks of the future, some of the wealthiest families in the world, all these sorts of things. Um, and that's the way I see it with the Bitcoin treasury companies and their shareholders to build effectively these businesses that, you know, if people want to still be part of it, i.e. be a shareholder for many many decades, um, that that that's what that's what we're building here. Um, you know, I I you know, it's quite difficult. I said to one of the institutional investors that I met with this morning that it may well be that one of the things that we build that is the most significant thing for us in the future potentially built on top of Bitcoin because you've got to remember we're developers at the end of the day. Um it might be that that thing has has not even been invented yet. Um you know because technology does move incredibly fast. you know, if you look at how we use AI today, for example, you know, it's completely different um to even how we used it a year ago and certainly different to how we used it two years ago. So, I think you just need to build a very very strong business um you know that's structured in the right way and be adaptive as you go.

**Borja Martels:**
(0:44:35) Amazing. I have my my last set and then on to you again Ioney um Andrew today um all of these companies are just buying Bitcoin like all of the Bitcoin treasury companies they buy the Bitcoin they keep it and and they keep the flywheel going. Do you believe or do you envision that this will change a bit in in the in the sense that um I for example believe that um Bitcoin treasury companies will eventually have to put their bitcoins at work and maybe get some sort of bitcoin yield maybe provide loans um I I don't know just like there's plenty of ideas um what's what's in what's your opinion what's your vision do you think that bit contrary companies will just be that just buy and hold and and that'll be it or do you think that there is a future in this sector, in this industry, uh for all of these companies to to put Bitcoin at work in some way, finding uh uh or creating products and and and so on.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:45:33) Yeah. No, I I completely agree with you. Um so, we get contacted by people every day, you know, wanting us to basically put our Bitcoin to work. We do not do it. Um and the reason why we don't do that is that the yield is not acceptable for the risk. um you know if somebody could offer us a zerorisk yield which technically is is almost impossible um on the bitcoin then it would be incredibly attractive. You know if you think about money as in pounds or dollars or euros the reason why you get interest is to effectively you know this isn't the the textbook one but this is how I think about it in my head is to compensate you for the loss of value that you're getting in that currency. That's ultimately why Bitcoin doesn't produce a yield. Um, so if you are producing a yield from Bitcoin, you're taking a risk. So our belief, and we've discussed this at lengths internally, is that it's not acceptable at the moment to generate a yield from Bitcoin. Um, you know, we don't even use leverage in our business. You know, we buy Bitcoin, pure Bitcoin, not a product, Bitcoin. um you know but at the same time I don't know when five years maybe 10 years 15 years time um if you've got the correct processes in place you know a bit like a bank offering mortgages and I don't mean subprime mortgages you know just to be clear you know good quality mortgages um you know it may be appropriate that you can you can take take a solution like that and generate a yield on the bitcoin you know this is this is not a today thing this is a future future thing. Um, you know, when I think about our operating business, the good thing about our operating business is that we've got a large number of small clients. So, if you're going to do a strategy with your Bitcoin in the future, you want to have that sort of approach because, you know, you're minimizing the chances of things that can go wrong. But to do that, you have to have very good processes because clearly the more people you deal with, the more cost there is. Um, so yeah, we think about that all the time. And that's what I mean about building things on top of the Bitcoin network. Um, you know, in the future, but I don't think we're there. Um, I I think that's at least years away.

**Ioney Butler:**
(0:47:44) Thank you. Uh, great questions. Um, I am excited for your mystery employees that are coming. I want to be following along to see who they are because you've got my interest peaked. Um, so we do like to dive into the news. We're only got 10 minutes left or eight minutes. Um, and so rather than me do the whole spiel, I just wanted to kind of get you and Borja's take on some of these stories. Um, one of them is about Adam Back um, and his company Bitcoin Standard Treasury as they're preparing to go uh, public through a merger with Cantal Equity Partners. Um, yeah. What are your thoughts on that? Do you Yeah. Do you give more context or you kind of excited about that? Yeah. Any comments that you might have about this? I think that would be great.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:48:27) that that goes back to, you know, the more good companies the better. You know, I'd be massively surprised if it's not going to be an excellent company. Um it'll be really interesting to see their strategy and how they, you know, what they build out and how they generate that yield. Um you know, he's been incredibly supportive to lots of lots of companies. You know, I saw an announcement this morning from uh the French one, Capital B, um that Adam Back has invested, you know, some more money in that company. Um I'm not sure whether he's a shareholder of of our company. I I don't think he is, but I would hope that he would be one day. Um, so I think it's fantastic. You know, the the thing that I like about their financing as well, um, is that in the same way that, you know, we've done the first, um, Bitcoin denominated bond in the UK, they're talking about doing that as well. Um, because what you've got out there in the world is you've got an an awful lot of people that have got a lot of Bitcoin and they want a a return that is the same or better than Bitcoin. Um, so it's an obvious thing to do to give those investors something that would work for them and potentially would work very very well for the company. Um, so I was really pleased to see that side of of what they're doing. You know, the numbers that they talk about are are are just colossal. Um, you know, it's it's quite impressive when you can see a company that can go from from nowhere to that sort of stage. You know, for us, you know, it's going to be a bit more of a a grind to the top, but we'll get there as well.

**Ioney Butler:**
(0:49:49) Do you think that um you know because yeah they're talking about uh 25,000 Bitcoin have been pledged by the company's founders. So to me that what it sounds like is you know I'm sure he has a lot of Bitcoin. They're kind of they've got a supply there. Does that make a difference with you know if you've got founders that hold large amounts of Bitcoin versus companies that are coming in and buying buying it on the market? Do you think that there's a difference there? accessibility of it or the ease in which they can raise money for it or

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:50:21) it's it's a tricky one because you know ultimately you know I think one of the things that um and Jesse who works for us he he designed a slide which is in strategies slides Michael Sailor talks about it all the time you know it's at the back of our deck as well um and it's the the the the chart that shows you you know the different pools of capital around the world and and how big Bitcoin is relative to all the others. And when you see it visualized, you know, it Bitcoin's tiny compared with them, you know. Um, and I think the one thing that everyone needs to be mindful of is what are you trying to achieve by this and doing stuff at the right time, you know, getting the right capital at the right time. So, you know, if you think about our company, you know, the last few months, the difference in the investors, the institutional investors today in the UK compared with three months ago, it's completely different. Um, and I think perhaps in addition to attracting the Bitcoin capital, you'd be better off converting the other capital to get interested in Bitcoin. Um, because that's how you're making Bitcoin better. You're encouraging other people to adopt it. The cynic would be, you know, with with with uh Bitcoin investment going into a public company is you're trying to create something out of thinner, you know, i.e., you know, leverage the MNAV that the other investors have created. So, I I think there's nothing wrong with it. I just think that everyone needs to be a bit mindful of the size of the different markets. So, for example, if I was, and this is probably why they've IPOed it or will IPO in the States as opposed to the UK, you know, the States is considerably bigger than the UK. Um, the capital markets, you know, completely different. Um, and and I I think that that and that's one of the reasons why this this model works so well in all these different locations all around the world because you get experts in particular capital markets that know how their capital markets work that have got similarities to other ones but are a bit different. So um yeah, I can't wait to see that one. Um and you know I'll I'll see how they sort of you know evolve out of there and and and maybe buy some

**Ioney Butler:**
(0:52:31) exciting. Was there ever any consideration for you about uh having sort of moving over to the US to do this or was it always you wanted to sort of be the to do this in the UK? I mean, you said that you'd been looking for years, it seems like, for a UK based company. Was there ever a consideration to kind of move things to the US?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:52:50) Well, not really. You know, I've I've I've lived in the UK all my life. My kids live in the UK. I'm quite proud of the UK. Um, you know, I think it's good to be a UK company, you know, run by UK people listed on the UK market. Um, you know, I'm I wouldn't rule it out years down the line having dual listings, you know, a bit like we've got the OTC listing in the States, we've got a Frankfurt listing or cross listing, I think the correct term is. Um, so I certainly wouldn't rule it out as we become a bigger and bigger company because, you know, it is it's not it's not just about our ambition. It's about where that capital is. Um and there will be certain investors say in the states um that will want to invest in say a NASDAQ listed company rather than you know an OTC or like a UK you know LSE or Aquis listed company. So I I think we'll just see how we go. Um you know it might be that we explore that. Maybe we'll in you know explore something in I don't know Australia you know uh you know Hong Kong maybe you know I I don't know. We'll just have to make those right moves at the right time. And I think most of the moves that we've made so far, you know, have been the right ones and we just try and, you know, sort of maintain that approach.

**Ioney Butler:**
(0:54:01) Fantastic. Um, Borja, did you have any uh final thoughts before we wrap up?

**Borja Martels:**
(0:54:07) Yes, I have a final thought and a final question. Ioney First off, I think that uh regarding um Adam's uh Bitcoin Treasury Standard Company, I think it's great. Uh I must say personally this is a personal opinion I like um much uh companies like Andrew's companies uh much better because the size of these companies already very very big um when Andrew did his I IPO um the market cap was roughly please correct me if I'm wrong Andrew but around 2 million pounds and today it's uh it got almost to or actually passed a billion pounds Um and that is that growth is just massive. It's insane. Um Adam Back's company is most definitely an amazing will be most definitely an amazing company. But the thing is that we will not see this kind of growth like uh shareholders people that invested in Andrew's company. We've seen like hundreds of X's right and um this is just very very hard to get unless you uh execute on the playbook in the way that Andrew did. So I think that there will be very few people that will provide as much as value as Andrew did uh to his to his shareholders. And even today there is very much more upside um for SWC than already very large Bitcoin treasury companies like 21 cap uh Treasury Standard and so on. Even though they can be amazing companies, um I also see that um the growth um that companies like the smarter web uh could execute on is very hard to match. And my my closing I said I also had a question is um Andrew to all the shareholders of your company me included um can you please tell us why the future is bright which I'm sure it is but can you please tell us?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:56:00) Yeah. So what I'd say is that you know we are genuinely only just getting started you know. So for me the most exciting thing is not the last three months but the next three months you know we're still a very very small company. Um you know we've got significant plans which you know will come out over the next couple of months um of of where we're going and how we're going to try and get there. Um you know we're we're only just scratching the surface of the institutional capital in the UK. um you know in uh you know when we did announce smarter convert we announced you know the the the fantastic French investors Tobam that came out as an institutional investor as you know they did the whole $21 million there um you know but we if you notice we haven't named ever a UK institution because we've never had one that's invested enough um to be disclosable i 3% um so I think that that's going to add a lot of credibility to what we're doing and that's why we've been working so hard on it. Um I think that you'll just see more of more of the same really. Um so without wanting to sound boring, what you've seen over the first three months will just be that meticulous every single day getting on with the job and then that boring work is what's going to create the excitement if it goes to plan.

**Ioney Butler:**
(0:57:20) Fantastic. Thank you so much, Andrew. For me, it has been an absolute pleasure.

**Borja Martels:**
(0:57:25) Thank you.

**Ioney Butler:**
(0:57:27) Thank you. I think Borja has like the the number one shareholder most um passionate and excited. I'm sure actually a lot of shareholders are. Um Andrew, thank you so much for joining us today. Where can people follow you and find out more about you?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:57:38) So the best thing to do is to either go to our website smarter web company.co.uk um or look us up on X um which is smarter web uk or my handle asjwebley um and uh yeah just sort of you know get in touch and you know sort of join us on the journey.

**Ioney Butler:**
(0:57:52) Fantastic. And Borja, do you uh what's yours for uh people to follow you if they're not already?

**Borja Martels:**
