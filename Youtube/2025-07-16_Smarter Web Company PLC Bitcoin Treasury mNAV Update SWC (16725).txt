- MNAV compression: Dropped to 4.28x (down from previous highs near 10x), still above 1x threshold for positive accretion

(0:00:00) Hello. How's everyone doing? What a day in the market. Phenomenal violence. I call it financial violence. Let's uh if you're new to the channel, we are doing the Smarter Web Company PLC at the moment, a daily share price analysis, a review of the market, um and a quick check through some of the X comments, and uh if you stay till the end, we'll do a bit of Q&A as well. Um it's days like this where uh things get really exciting, right, I um let's uh let's get straight into it. The close the market closed. The UK market closed at let's just quickly check the Aquis page. Smarter web company PLC the bid price of255% down on yesterday. What is going on? Of course, we woke up this morning to the announcement of more Bitcoin being bought. The uh business is now at 1,600 bitcoins. with cash in hand of £4 million. So, let's take all of that information, the closed share price, and go straight across to our model, shall we?

(0:01:00) This is what we do. We try and understand where the game is going, where it's trying to get to, what's happening, who are the players, what are they playing, what games the lots of games are being played at the moment. Um, okay. So subscription was the last activity on the 9th of July £325. Increase in shares at that point was just over 1%. Um 10.3 million was raised at that point with an increase of shares of 1.3%. The business is now currently at 1,600 bitcoins, £4 million as we said cash. Um, at the current prices, it looks like they could add another 46 bitcoins. That would take the total to 1,646. The mnav, according to this model, is closed today at 4.28. Look at that. 4.28. It has crashed down. There was a point where we were thinking 10 mnav. 10 mnav. Has the days of 10 mnavs gone? Who knows? Is that the end? Of course not. Anything above one is good because that means that we can sell shares and buy Bitcoin positively. Positive accretion. If we scroll slightly across to the the right, you can see the sats per share. The model still works. Anything above one, the uh sats per share will always increase. Um, so very important you understand the whole Understanding Bitcoin Holdings and Financial Metrics business model here and not get shaken out and panicked by market reactions as we've had today.

(0:02:30) We have the MNAV sitting at 4.28. This is uh below the previous book build of 2.90 happening on the 26th of June that happened with uh at that point £41 million was raised over4 million. Um would this be a book build? Could there be a book build in the works in the background? I don't know. Who knows? That would be the first one below the previous prices if there was. I mean, these are the best prices. Let's take a look at some of the the trading activity on ADVFM where you we can see some of the uh trades that are happening. You can you can see these clips 15,000 25,000 25 2020 2020. Do you think that's normal retail on the on the opposite side sell side 10,000 20,000 12,000 I think there's more going on here. 20,000 25,000 on the buy side. You see these smaller amounts 100 930189 those seven shares somebody's bought hey did you manage to buy the dips look at the volatility today it's uh crazy right the stock is volatile so there is a lot happening here just trying to digest myself as we speak

(0:03:30) let's flick across to the chart see what the chart is saying wow Wow, we've landed on the US chart. As you can see, yesterday we were talking about the potential gap fill at the 350 mark, 310. It's actually hit it hit 315. It looks like from Trading View, the US market is still live. So, by the looks of this, this is closed the gap up or closing it in progress. Are we going to get back to the $436 mark overnight? We we shall be watching. Um, you can see that the support levels on this chart. Let me zoom in a bit more. Let's just zoom this out. Look at that. It's bounced right on the one level of the um Fibonacci. The zero 786 was where it was trading at yesterday. It's bounced all the way down there. Can it bounce all the way back up to the 0618 in short time? Look at that. Look at the treasuries. It's a blood bath out there. MSTR, it's going the other way. H100 the other way. The rest. What is going on? It's not just SWC. There are people selling. There is a uh let's just quickly check the UK chart. Look at that. Wow. Up, down, up, down. Not as much down. Let's take a quick measure. Oof. Oof. 47% around about 45% from the top there. Amazing. That's not as volatile as we've had it in the past, guys. Look at where it dropped from about 63%. That is. So, hang in there. This is volatility. Violence down, violence up. And what's going to happen over the next few days? A lot of talk about book builds.

(0:05:00) Let's go back to the model. Let's see what else thish shows us. Back in May, increasing shares, increasing shares, increase in shares. This model is showing that in May the business had increased its shares by approximately 25% dilution over 25% dilution. In July, let's look at June first. June 24% increase in shares. We're in July. We've only increased shares by four 4.29%. I would highly expect that to change. The ATM would at current prices increase about 6% the increase in shares issuance. I mean they're already floating but that's that's there 6% for the ATM. uh a book build another five 6% you would think even then that's not getting back to the I mean all this points to positive accretion here you're you're diluting less than your you're you're increasing your Bitcoin per share by so this is all positive from that perspective I know the share price is currently detached but this is the game here we're we're we're selling shares we're issuing equity raising cash and building the Bitcoin per share column V. Here we go. That always keeps going up. As long as the MNAVS are above one, the model works. Um, yeah, that's what I wanted to show you. We can expect fundraising. If I was fundraising, would I fund raise at these Market Volatility and Share Price Dynamics prices? Probably not, if I'm honest. I would potentially even wait for the market to flush through. I would let it let it depress itself completely. Let Let's see. T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T TWWCF. There we go. I mean, that there's some positive green coming up here. Oh, I would I would not raise at these prices, but if if there was one in the works, why not? I I have said that doesn't take a lot to move this stock. This this stock today is on the UK side. Let's have a look again on the uh chart here showing me a low of 210. Did anyone manage to snap that? And a high of 38. I mean that is volatile. So it doesn't take much to move this stock. Wow. So much to digest there. Keep moving on. The uh time is ticking.

(0:07:00) I wrote 1,600 bitcoins times $1 million times one mnave is 1.2 billion pounds. Ladies and gentlemen, nothing to fear. Bitcoin's going up. Even if the mnav stays at one or or goes down to one, sorry. The business is at 1,600 bitcoins. That's a 1.2 billion pound business any time. Extend your time horizons. Um, X comments. Let's go. X comments. What's the Smarter Web community page saying? All right. Felix worried about the current share price action. Adam Liv, everybody give Adam Liv some some love. He he is uh he has cracked this mart web company path to 10,000 bitcoins. Um, amazing US ticker fighting to get Oh, Community Insights and Q&A Session there's so much volume today, John. There is massive amount of volume. KHMC Christina, I am buying back some SWC here. Wow, she's a smart cookie. She knows when she gets a bargain there. Um, the smarter realm baby getting thrown out with the bath water. There's a lot lot of uh volatility in the in the share price, volatility in the X comments. Mad. Great stuff. Let's go.

(0:08:00) Right. Moving on. We have Q&A. Short sharp. Actually, before we get to Q&A, the Smarter Web Company, as well as buying bitcoins today to get to 1,600 Bitcoin, published a new metric. Jesse Meyers, um this is a very interesting new new metric. It's a version of the existing uh days to cover. I in in summary, it's the annualized version of a days to cover type metric. We shall do a separate video on this and go through but have a look. This is trying to bridge traditional finance world with the new Bitcoin treasury world and try and explain to everyone how the premium and how the valuation is calculated. Amazing stuff. Great stuff. Let's crack on.

(0:08:30) Community Q&A. Uh user WW looks like some some rotating out of S to ride new horses. Ah, don't not sure. Not quite sure. It's a sectorwide thing. Um, so yeah, I mean rotation to MSTR unlikely. Paul Cotton, great video. Look forward to these every day. Thanks very much. You there's uh so much happening that you want to um provide commentary as things uh evolve cuz by the time some things happen, it's moved on. It might it might have reversed by the time this uh this video gets out. EWC58, the instant gratification crowd is all in a tizzy. Yeah, it's instant gratification. It's volatility. It's compounding. It's days to it's fast moving, right? People come in with expectations. Um and uh naturally when your expectations is are not matched by reality, then there's a human reaction. Um and it's usually disappointment. So step back and as they say zoom out because like even if the even if you look at these charts the um the movement actually on a grand scale of things is not uh how can you put it it's not look at that right smooth up down up it's not come that down chill calm it'll come back um All right, another gift today. Was able to buy TSWCF, says Sandeep Star as low as $3.90. Now my second largest position after MSTR. Yeah, I mean these prices I couldn't we can't get funds cleared quick enough to take advantage sometimes. Manning 69, great video again, Voscha, thank you. My favorite thing on TV, my TV host now of YouTube. Funny on the drunken poster comments yesterday. Yeah, check it out if you haven't seen that one towards the end. Drunk on FR, you still out there, mate. Hope you're all good. Um, Louise Hassan for Louis Hassan, sorry. 4265. Can you do a price prediction video, please? Yeah, why not?
