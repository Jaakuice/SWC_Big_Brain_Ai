**Cedric:**
(0:00:00) [Opening montage] Who's going to be the bidder for Bitcoin when each Bitcoin is $5 million? Bitcoin is the risk-free rate. It's the safest asset to hold. And I think that the next 20 years is going to be Bitcoin treasury companies. If you're Apple or Microsoft, you just can't get there. How much Bitcoin will the Bitcoin treasury companies eat up? We've had enough reps as Bitcoiners at rejecting things and then watching those eventually implode. Sailor likes to say that, you know, the only thing better than Bitcoin is more Bitcoin. We're no longer in a four-year time scale paradigm anymore. Now we're real.

**Cedric:**
(0:00:42) [Matrix clip] How do you define real? You can't jump into cash. Cash is trash. What do you do? You get out.

**Cedric:**
(0:00:57) Jesse Meyers aka Crecious on X is a Bitcoin advocate and was a co-founder of On-Ramp Bitcoin, sharing insights on Bitcoin's valuation and its potential as a store of value. With a Stanford MBA and experience at Bain and Company, he focuses on educating his audience about Bitcoin's market dynamics and investment strategies. Jesse is currently consulting on Bitcoin strategy for Bitcoin Treasury Company, the Smarter Web Company, which has been the fastest growing financial security in 2025. He is also a Bitcoin strategy advisor to UTXO Management. Jesse Myers, welcome back to the Bitcoin Matrix podcast. How are you?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:01:34) I'm good. I'm good, Cedric. Now, we get to talk about the other thing I'm most passionate about in the world right now, which is Bitcoin Treasury companies and what's going on there.

**Cedric:**
(0:01:44) Yeah, this is the elephant in the room. We got into it a little bit at the end of our last conversation, but I wanted to really dive into it here. So, let's start there. Why are you so passionate about Bitcoin Treasury companies? How did your journey on Bitcoin treasury companies start? When did you become interested in them?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:02:03) That's actually the right question because it's an interesting sequence there. I obviously I'm a Bitcoin maximalist. I ever since I'm going through altcoins and arriving at Bitcoin in 2019 really that's when I became started to see the full picture die hard Bitcoin ever since and I've been skeptical of anything besides just holding cold storage Bitcoin and so warming up to Bitcoin treasury companies as a concept has been a sequence right where of course it was interesting when Micro Strategy started doing convertible notes in 2020 late 2020 I guess that was and it was cool but I was already all in on Bitcoin right and then the first time I became aware of it was it was at the Bitcoin conference in Nashville I heard Dylan use the phrase accretive delilution and then he explained what he meant by that and that kind of was like oh wow I didn't think that was possible I didn't think that delusion could be anything but a bad thing for a shareholder. And so that kind of set me back. And then 6 months later, I happened to do a podcast with Michael Sailor where I got to ask him the question of I live by your advice of never sell your Bitcoin. But now what you guys are doing is very compelling and I I like the idea of Bitcoin yield. So, what do you say to somebody in in my shoes of never sell your Bitcoin, but you guys might be growing Bitcoin? And he said that for Bitcoin Maximos, Bitcoin is the risk-free rate. It's the safest asset to hold, but there's still a place in portfolios for risk. Have to have risk capital as part of your portfolio. And that really got me. It got me thinking about that. I then saw Dylan at at Michael Sailor's New Year's Eve party and we talked just outside of Sailor's Yacht. talked for a brief bit about what he was doing at MetaPlanet and then we arranged to have a follow-up call and so a few weeks later I was on vacation in Key West actually and and I had an hour and a half long conversation with Dylan over the phone about the coin treasury companies and about the opportunities that he sees here and what he sees unfolding and that rocked my world really. And so I started to pay more attention to it, look into it more. And as I did that, I figured out that Dylan was right about all of it, and it's the most exciting thing going on in Bitcoin and in finance. That kind of led me to getting involved and eventually found myself helping out UTXO portfolio companies and now focusing on smarter web to really try to repeat the MetPanet playbook in the UK, which we're off to a great start with.

**Cedric:**
(0:04:54) All right. Well, let's go there then. What are the mechanics of Bitcoin treasury companies? How does this all work? Maybe just at a base level.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:05:06) We already introduced the idea of creative dilution and I'll explain that first and it demands more explanation too. A public company can issue more shares and that is dilutive to existing shareholders, right? And that you're splitting the assets of the company with more shareholder holders. You've diluted ownership. But if you are issuing shares in a condition of when you're trading at a premium to your enterprise value to your book value to your what people shorthand to net asset value you can use the proceeds raised from selling those new shares to buy more Bitcoin and because you've been your stock is trading at a premium when you issue shares at that premium you're and use those proceeds to buy Bitcoin you're adding Bitcoin per share like that you're growing the amount of Bitcoin held by the company more than you're diluting shareholders. So it's dilutive but it's more accretive than it is dilutive. So it nets out to this idea of accretive delilution. Very recently Michael Sailor has has encouraged that we don't call it accretive dilution just net it down to what it is. It's either accretive or it's dilutive. And he's right about that. A transaction like that where you're issuing equity to buy more Bitcoin it's accretive ultimately. So it's a a creative share issuance and that's what we should call it. Accretive delution is a bit of a contradiction but it also encapsulates the whole process there. It is simultaneously dilutive but it is more accretive than it is dilutive.

**Cedric:**
(0:06:33) Let's maybe talk more about MNAV then. What what do you see as the life cycle of the relationship of the MNAV dynamic over the life cycle of a Bitcoin treasury company maybe in the first 12 to 24 months?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:06:46) Yeah, that's the make or break time. I think I think it's been very interesting that MetaPlanet kind of pioneered this approach of starting from nothing and growing a Bitcoin treasury company by getting the flywheel going and then just executing and continuing to to accretively add Bitcoin per share and relentlessly do that. And so that's where we're seeing pop up now is companies who are they're inspired by strategy, but they're really more directly following the MetPanlet example because you can start from nothing and do this. So, you know, right off the bat, you have to get the flywheel going. You you have to show worldwide investors that you're committed to growing Bitcoin per share and that you're doing it and you have a track record of doing it because that is what makes an investor willing to pay a premium. And this is what I think Bitcoin maximists one of the first areas that they reflexively reject or question or wary of the idea that you're paying one bitcoin to get 0.2 bitcoin of exposure through the shares that you hold and what they represent in terms of bitcoin treasury ownership. So people don't like that idea on the surface, but what you're really doing is you're paying a premium for a company who's delivering Bitcoin yield. And you should be willing to pay a premium for that. that asset is worth more than just a static amount of Bitcoin because you're baking in the expectation of potential future performance and trying to the market is constantly trying to find what's the right valuation for that potential future Bitcoin yield delivery and discounting that back to the present. If you take strategy as an example, they're over the first six months of this year, they delivered 20% Bitcoin yield. So they grew Bitcoin per share by 20%. And the question is like, how much are you willing to pay for that? So they trade at a MNAV of 2 and a half or something like that. Balances between 1 and a half and three and a half. And that seems reasonable. If you actually do the math out for if they're trading at a two mnav, how long does it take? If you're do doing 20% growth every six months, how long does it take to to grow into that 2x mnav? It it takes two years. So if you then think about what that means in traditional equities as a comparison, like a traditional equity, you're accustomed to paying a PE multiple. you're paying today for an ownership share that is 20 or 30 PE, right? Meaning that you're paying for you're paying an amount equal to 20 to 30 years of earnings before you cumulatively earn back the price you're paying up front. as opposed to a Bitcoin treasury company like strategy where that math works out if they maintain the same growth that works out to two years or a little less. So I actually think when you compare it on that basis which is what we encapsulated into the P bid ratio price to Bitcoin yield delivered ratio it lines it up years to years PE ratio years to P bid years and you see the order of magnitude different right like there if you're willing to get comfortable with how Bitcoin treasury companies deliver value through growing the balance sheet there's screaming value in Bitcoin treasury companies that are well-run and are have a track record of executing as compared to traditional equity PE ratios.

**Cedric:**
(0:10:40) Yeah, that was a lot. We can pack dig into any of those topics if you want to or take it wherever you want.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:10:46) Well, let's go further with MNAB like let's say like with MetPanet you see the range more of five MNAP to 15 MNAP and how is maybe Metaplanet thinking through what to do at different levels of that and is that cyclical at all?

**Cedric:**
(0:10:59) Yeah, you you asked about the first 12 to 24 months. You know, I think in the early stages of a Bitcoin treasury company, it's possible to grow incredibly fast because it's relative to your base. So, if you start with a few Bitcoin, it's very easy to double that, right? And do that a bunch of times. And so, Bitcoin yield can and should be really high in the early days of a Bitcoin treasury company. And that can justify quite high MNAVs relative to a company like strategy that is it's hard to double the amount of Bitcoin Strategy owns. In Metanet's first 6 months, their MNAP bounced between five and 15, I'd say. And Smarter Web, we've largely been in that kind of range, too. At the moment, we are like 3.2 too because there's been this like compression contraction with Bitcoin treasury companies all over the world just sectorwide over the last month or so and we can talk about that and what I see happening there too but I think MetPanet kind of shows us that you should expect or it's not unusual to have a high MNAV when you're small and growing rapidly and we can jump into the P bid ratio that we at Smarter Web have have been using to analyze these things. But when you look at the numbers with that lens, even a 15 mnav is low for a small Bitcoin treasury company that's delivering Bitcoin yield at a very rapid rate. Currently, MetaPlanet is, you know, growing into its its MNAV premium in about 0.4 years. So meaning like you're paying a premium now to buy that stock relative to the Bitcoin ownership that your shares constitute. But if they maintain the same yield delivery they've done over the last quarter, it'll take half a year before you're you've grown your Bitcoin per share back to what you would have had if you just held Bitcoin. And then beyond that 0.4 years, that half a year, it's all upside. that it's all Bitcoin gained in terms of your ownership of Bitcoin and there's that other layer. Is it really Bitcoin that you own if it's not in your cold storage? Yes, that's true, too. But what we're talking about here is the risk capital portion of your portfolio.

**Cedric:**
(0:13:17) What is maybe the secular theory here for UTXO management regarding these securities in different markets? So, you see strategy here in the US, the United States, a huge market, Metaplan is Japan. We'll get into smarter web company which is in obviously in the UK. What is the theory here or the hypothesis?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:13:41) Yeah, UTXO's thesis which I agree with and it's part of why I've been working with them is that there will be a leading Bitcoin treasury company in each capital market in the world. I think that's just logically where this is headed, which is to say that there's basically going to be a strategy in each significant capital market. And I think in Japan, we've seen that MetaPlanet has that just about locked up in terms of being the eventual winner there. And we'll see what happens in all the other capital markets in the world. But UTXO's philosophy or their thesis is that they want to be early in the eventual leaders of in each capital market with this particular strategy because I think that where this is headed as an industry, I think Bitcoin treasury companies are a new industry. I think that I think that one thing I learned in business school which stuck with me was that at Stanford you'd have a bunch of venture capital veterans come in and talk to the talk to your class and like private equity guys too and they'd all tell their war stories about when their industry was developing and they were early and I remember in one class this legend legendary venture capitalist with a name that everybody would recognize guys talked about the early days and then at the end of class fielded questions and a classmate of mine asked that what's the next best thing what's the thing that we can do in our career that's like what you got to do and he said there is nothing like that the best you can do is come work for me and it stuck with me like it I felt like the rest of the class took that as oh yeah that makes sense but to me it was like well obviously this just means that even people who lived through like the newest wave of finance. Can't imagine how there could be new waves of finance coming along. And I think that what we've seen over the last 16 years is Bitcoin has been that the thing that nobody saw coming that has been the big story in finance during this period. And I think that the next 20 years is going to be Bitcoin treasury companies because of the incentives at play. The ability of Bitcoin treasury companies to tap into Tradfi. And I think the net of it is that Bitcoin treasury companies will be disproportionately the vehicles through which trapped pools of capital in the world access Bitcoin and flow into Bitcoin. that'll just be facilitated by these conduits. It'll be Bitcoin treasury companies in each capital market set up to offer capital that's trapped in equities paying 30 33 PE ratio for Apple, 53 for Nvidia, and here's alternative investment thesis that offers a lot better value if you understand the math and are comfortable with it. Um, and so I think value will flow out of overvalued equities markets into Bitcoin treasury companies for that reason. But I think the the end state, the endgame is tapping into the fixed income market as strategy has started to do with their preferred um equity in instruments. And that's over $300 trillion of capital globally that is all getting risk adjusted mids singledigit returns. Meanwhile, like true monetary inflation is 7 8%. So that's all that capital is getting at best treading water risk adjusted. And and then you have strategy coming out with these products saying here a fixed income market. We'll give you 10% every year if you give us your dollars and we'll buy Bitcoin with it because we know it's going to grow 29% a year for the next 20 years. And so that's what they're now embarking on. And I think that's the end state for each capital market in the world is eventually there will be a leading Bitcoin treasury company with a large enough balance sheet to offer the same kind of preferred equity instruments to those markets and they will just hoover up fixed income capital that's looking for better returns and Bitcoin will power all of that.

**Cedric:**
(0:18:07) Wow, this is fascinating. So, one, I think some of us really understand the idea of trapped capital from just maybe the perspective of an IRA or 401k or Roth and you're when you go through your Bitcoin journey, if you start really start thinking about maybe reallocation versus sort of new allocation. So, instead of a I could put in X amount of dollars per week through savings, maybe there's things I have that I could sell and repurpose to Bitcoin. And you start thinking about trap your own trapped capital. With COVID, a lot of people were able, myself included, to try to take as much money out of the system as possible. But myself included, has some money trapped in there. You start looking at things like you start thinking, okay, why would I want to be in the S&P 500 over here when I'm really convinced Bitcoin is going to outperform that and I want a greater allocation to this thing. So, you say, okay, I can get access to GBTC and you see the pros and cons of that. and then strategy obviously came onto the scene and but and then that's nothing in comparison to the amount of other trapped pools of capital but I think a lot of people's upfront question Bitcoiners and non- Bitcoiners alike is is this sustainable how is this not a Ponzi I want to ask it directly because you're making the more of the prognostication that this is more of a new wave of finance right so maybe how do we how do you respond to the how is this not a Ponzi

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:19:28) First, this stuff is fascinating because it's from like a sociological like psychology. It's very interesting how Bitcoiners react to the idea of a Bitcoin treasury company because it it flies in the face of a lot of historical Bitcoin values, right? Not your keys, not your coins, everything about centralization. And then this model lives in in opposition to some of those principles. And I think that part of that is that over the last 10 years in particular, it has been very beneficial to Bitcoiners to adhere to those principles and reject anything that offered any kind of alternative. Um, that's how you avoided altcoins. That's how you avoided BlockFi and Celsius. That's how you stayed safe. And part of this too is I want to be clear that I think that anybody who invests in Bitcoin treasury companies should also strongly consider having some cold storage Bitcoin. Like you were saying, like the profile of your portfolio. So maybe you're not, you don't have to be 100% Bitcoin. You're still going to have operating flows. You're going to have equity in your entrepreneurial pursuits or your public pursuits with the companies you work for, whatever. hard to measure always things those things in sats but and future value but there's some part of your curve where you say yeah I want to take a little greater risk than just my risk-free asset

**Cedric:**
(0:20:51) yeah exactly and that's up to anybody to decide what makes sense for them probably somewhere between 20% and 80% like you don't want to go outside of those bands I think maybe you just want to be extremely safe and just hold cold storage Bitcoin that's fine but I don't think it's a great idea to go 100% Bitcoin treasury companies and not have any cold storage Bitcoin.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:21:14) Anyway, so Bitcoiners have trouble with this idea of centralizing your coins and trusting to a public company that has risks inherent to how it's operated. And I think that it we've had enough reps as as Bitcoiners at rejecting things and then watching those eventually implode that there's a lot of confidence that this is the same kind of pattern recognition. But the super important difference here is that these are not altcoins that are saying like, "Oh, we're Dentacoin. We're going to be the new currency for dentists." Like trust value in this idea, right? That's what an altcoin is asking of you. And BlockFi or Celsius is saying, "We'll give you 6% yield. Don't worry about how we're getting it." When really what they're doing is lending it at 10% a year to high risk-taking hedge funds that end up imploding. The difference with this is that the entire idea is to accumulate Bitcoin. We as Bitcoiners, we we believe that Bitcoin is the best asset in the world to hold. That's what we want to do. And these companies are designed to do that and accumulate more of it. Sailor likes to say that the only thing better than Bitcoin is more Bitcoin. And that's the idea here is using public company capital market tools that individuals do not have access to in order to raise fiat capital to buy more Bitcoin in a way in a way that is accretive to shareholders. So, it's arbiting Tradfi to use fiat against itself to accumulate more Bitcoin. And when you view it that way, it's very much in line with Bitcoiner values. It's just that it has these surface red flags that people are like, I don't know about coin yield as a concept. That sounds like BlockFi. I don't know about centralization because we've seen how that goes in the past. I also think there's nuance to a lot of things and I think we have to almost preface a lot of things as Bitcoiners. We're like we believe this but there's new there's not everything applies to everybody. You your dollars might not or sats might not be trapped but there's a lot of and so I like Sailor's idea of a Bitcoin refinery and you're bringing Bitcoin exposure but also different products through the Bitcoin mill that aren't for Bitcoiners. You know, they're for non- Bitcoiners who don't realize what they need or want and like this is being designed for and these are huge markets and this is part of Bitcoin adoption or hyper bitcoinization whether it goes good or not these companies could all fail and this is the exploratory process of finding out what works in trady and how Bitcoin could eat all of that that's the positive side I see of it

**Cedric:**
(0:24:00) yeah completely agree at the end of the day it's like Bitcoin treasury companies are able to do exactly what any individual Bitcoiner would love to do I would love to go create my own preferred equity ities and take them to the bond market and say, "Look, I'll give you 10% if you give me hundreds of millions of dollars and I'll buy Bitcoin with it because I know that's going to outperform the 10% obligation I have to you." So, it's like a it's like having this overcolateralized pristine asset.

**Cedric:**
(0:24:36) Yep. How does your accounting background maybe fit into your thinking here?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:24:42) Yeah. And you're an accountant and you're you might be following a similar path with me here. I think it's interesting that Pierre Rashard and I are both interested in Bitcoin Treasury companies and rather convinced that they're the next big thing. We both went to the same accounting school a couple years apart and excellent. UT Austin's accounting program is fantastic. And when you learn about accounting, you're learning about the language of business, the X's and O's of business. And you're learning about financial statements. Like a business's value is its financial statements. And that means its balance state its balance sheet today and its income statements into the future and how you discount those back to the present and put a value on that. That's how that's what a traditional equity valuation is and it tends to focus on the future profits profit stream cash flows into the future discounted back to the present. And this is a different approach to that but no less real where coin treasury companies they are they tend to have operating businesses that in smarter web's case it is a web designed business with 250 clients and it makes a small profit every year but we have decided to make Bitcoin our treasury asset and we have an explicit goal of increasing Bitcoin per share by using capital market tools and that has been the real value gener generator for shareholders over Smarter Web's life as a public company because we have added a lot of Bitcoin to the balance sheet and that and what is the balance sheet at the end of the day? It's the liquidation value and in shorthand it's the liquidation value of the company. You you got your assets, your liabilities and your equity, right? And Smarter Web has currently 2,450 Bitcoin on its balance sheet and no debt. So all of that Bitcoin is equity on on that side of the balance sheet. And the strategy that we're employing is growing the Bitcoin per share by using these capital market tools and managing to do that with quite a quick rate of Bitcoin per share growth which is causing shareholders to earn a lot of value in a short space of time because we're growing the balance sheet. And we're not so focused with this strategy. It's not so much about the income statement. It's about growing the balance sheet, but no less real, right? Like it still is the value of the business at the end of the day. And I think that's part of why traditional equity markets and investors and analysts are completely caught off guard and don't know what to make of these things because Bitcoin treasury companies like Metanet are very valuable now and you have this book value that's inarguable but 15 months ago they would have never been able to understand how the company could possibly become so valuable in a short space of time and because they were are trained to focus on the income statement and this was a failing hotel company and they completely caught off guard by the idea that you can issue a bunch of equity and buy a bunch more Bitcoin and have that be accreative to shareholders and massively grow your balance sheet in a short space of time.

**Cedric:**
(0:28:01) I almost feel like Bitcoin is a return to real balance sheet risk management. It seems like in the fiat economy, it's yeah, it's grow your liabilities by how much you could afford through your income statement and pray that just you're on the better side of that bet, I guess. But how do you think about balance sheet and risk management? And maybe let's use strategy as an example. It's like one of my I try to wrap my head around the long-term in like how dimminimous the fiat payments become maybe against the collateral of Bitcoin and the asset value of Bitcoin. But I worry a lot about a volatility and we know we can get into how volatility is maybe vitality but like how do you think through maybe the appropriate amount of leverage or debt because I could maybe my fear is that the you acquire the asset and then the asset goes down a lot in value and you have those expected payments.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:28:58) It varies for Bitcoin treasury companies at different stages of their life cycle. Strategy is mature, right? And let's say metaplanet is growth and smarter web is early stage growth like high growth. So you know when you're at strategy scale mnavs have compressed because it's hard to double your the amount of bitcoin that you have on your balance sheet at that scale. And that's where like the idea of Bitcoin torque starts to really matter, right? Like how accreative is it per dollar of capital that you raise. If you're if you're like a 1.5 mnav, you're not getting a ton of accretion every time you issue new equity because you want that premium to be higher in order to harvest to get more accretive terms there. And that's where it starts to become more attractive to tap into debt. and strategy's done a brilliant thing and package that up into preferred equities that are easier for them to manage and control and and issue and lower latency just way better for strategy to source capital that way and through those tools they're able to get very accreative capital raises where depending on the instrument it can be several times more effective than issuing new equity but if you're early stage page like Smarter Web or even MetaPlanet. If you've got over a 3xmnav, it's great to issue more equity for the benefit of shareholders. Like they want that. They should want that and they want they want new equity issuance to happen as frequently as possible as much as possible. So long as that MNAV is anywhere really anywhere above two but three three it feels better for sure and yeah so yeah talked a little bit around I don't know if I'm missing a core question from you but

**Cedric:**
(0:30:54) it seems like uh the higher the MNAB the greater the appetite for accretion for sort of creative solutions.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:30:59) What about the UK?

**Cedric:**
(0:31:06) Yeah. What is going on in the UK? How does how do Bitcoin treasury companies tap into the lo local context there?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:31:12) Yeah, this is what part of what's been really interesting to think about with when strategy showed up and started doing this. I think everybody thought that you have to be in that particular circumstance in order to pull it off. Like you have to be a multi-billion dollar company that's absolute cash cow in order to service the debt to to do this strategy. And then MetaPlanet has proved no, you don't need to be in that situation. You can start from nothing and you just have to execute the playbook with commitment and do it relentlessly. And that has inspired people, new companies doing this all over the world, hoping to be, I think, repeat the Metaplanet playbook. Part of our what we all think now. I I think the general view is that it was that strategy was unique and I think there's a kind of prevailing view now that MetaPlanet was unique because they were the first ones to do this playbook there in Japan where it's preferential tax treatment for companies holding Bitcoin as opposed to individuals holding Bitcoin and because of Japan's debt burden there's going to be a flight to Bitcoin and those tailwinds make it So that this will only work in Japan. And just the same way that the beliefs that strategy was unique were proven wrong. I think the beliefs that metaplanet are unique is unique are being proven wrong. Basically, I think there's structural systemic reasons to do this anywhere and I think that they are helped by idiosyncratic geography specific tailwinds in we talked about the ones in Japan. In the UK, the FCA, the SEC of the UK, currently hasn't authorized any Bitcoin ETF. There's no way for retirement account money to access Bitcoin exposure right now in the UK. But now there is. Now there are Bitcoin treasury companies that are UK based. You can invest in and get exposure to what is it's not a direct clean this tracks Bitcoin vehicle, but it's Bitcoin exposure. And in my opinion, it's more attractive than a Bitcoin ETF because a Bitcoin ETF, yeah, you're centralizing, you're taking on the risks of involved in centralization, but you're not getting any Bitcoin yield. You're not growing your Bitcoin. I think a Bitcoin treasury company is more attractive for that reason if you're going to centralize your coins. So anyway, there's 1 to two trillion pounds of capital that can't access Bitcoin in the UK. And now with smarter web being the leader in the UK, it's possible to get exposure through your retirement account to Bitcoin. And that's a big tailwind for bringing capital in. If you think about the scale of those things, it's 1 to two trillion and a market cap company of 500 million pounds, 0.05% or so, even smaller depending on the range. And yeah, that's so 1% of that capital is interested in Bitcoin and there's no ETF and it flows into Bitcoin treasury companies. That's a gigantic tailwind. And that's even before you talk about fixed income market, right? Because the short and medium term is using equity issuance to grow your Bitcoin per share. And that's really tapping into capital that's trapped in equity markets that either can't access Bitcoin and wants to in in the case of the UK or is just looking for value. I think that's the other thing that that I think that's the really big thing that the world is not yet aware of is that you're paying 33 PE for Apple or 53 for Nvidia, but you could pay effectively two for strategy. Where's the value in equities markets if you think about it that way? And so I think we're seeing and you're we're going to keep seeing a flow of value seeking capital from equities markets into Bitcoin treasury companies that from people and institutions who understand the value proposition and the model here in parallel with people who are just looking for Bitcoin exposure and can't get it. And I think that's the big unique thing in the UK is that's a pretty big tailwind right there.

**Cedric:**
(0:35:48) Yeah. It's amazing how many dots I'm connecting here like especially to the trap dollars. Just I remember how excited I was like learning about GBTC. Yeah. And then strategy to save those trap dollars. And part of it too is if you have your brokerage account and you get into Bitcoin and yeah, maybe you stack some Bitcoin, but you still have your brokerage dollars and you don't want to move them out and liquidate and then go to your bank and then send them to your crypto exchange and then buy spot Bitcoin and then move that to your cold storage. There's a a lot there's a lot of steps there. And if you were, maybe you bought some Bitcoin and then you became more bullish on Bitcoin and you're like, I would like to have an easy way to get exposure through my brokerage account. And this way you sell a little bit of your portfolio or maybe it's you just move some of your money market funds or bond capital into Bitcoin treasury companies instead and you do it all within one platform. I think that lowers the barriers to entry for pointing additional capital towards Bitcoin.

**Cedric:**
(0:36:53) Yeah. I mean, in terms of barriers to entry, I think even just within households, like your partners, your husbands, and your wives would there's a semblance of not all of it's in the cold storage. There's this thing that I had in bonds. I don't want it in bonds anymore. It wasn't in Bitcoin. So, now it's in this non- Bitcoin thing that's got Bitcoin exposure versus non- Bitcoin thing that has no Bitcoin exposure. And they're both from the perspective of cold storage maybe alleviating concerns for other people in the household.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:37:22) Great point to add on to that like you already like most people already have their Bitcoin and then they've got their stocks that they've picked or whatever their portfolio allocation for risk capital. And for a lot of people, this may be this may amount to saying, "You know what? I think there's a better value proposition with some of my risk capital that's sitting in my stock portfolio rather than in Nvidia, hoping that continues to go up. I'm going to I'm going to point it towards Bitcoin Treasury companies because I like Bitcoin and this risk makes more sense at this point in time to me."

**Cedric:**
(0:38:00) How much Bitcoin will the Bitcoin treasury companies eat up?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:38:06) Yeah, this um I I made myself go through the exercise of trying to like come up with an answer to this question as I became very bullish on the mechanics here. And it's anybody's guess really. We'll see how it all plays out. But when I think about who's going to be the big bidder, like where is the capital going to come from for the next 20 years of Bitcoin's monetization, right? Like in in the context of that global asset landscape chart that people know of from me, Bitcoin's tiny, equities and bonds are big and money is also big. And that's a new thing that strategy is tapping into. But those three buckets, those are huge buckets. And everybody feels and knows that for tiny little thimble Bitcoin to grow, it's going to take capital from these other big buckets. But how? Like to date, it has been individuals waking up and saying, you know what, I don't want to hold all those bonds in my portfolio. I want to buy Bitcoin. And like individuals manually going through that series of steps we outlined to make that happen. And I think going forward, what happens is that Bitcoin treasury companies accelerate that osmotic flow of capital from these overvalued buckets to the undervalued Bitcoin bucket. They facilitate the flow of capital from each of these buckets by creating these products that meet that capital where it's at. And then when you think about how that's going to play out, who's going to be the bidder for Bitcoin when each Bitcoin is $5 million? Like the big bidder, I think, is going to be strategy because they just got the next trillion dollars of capital out of the bond market by offering them 10%. So that's how that bond market capital is going to flow into Bitcoin. It's going it's not going to go directly to Bitcoin. It goes through strategy or the other winners in each capital market and then into Bitcoin. And so when you think about that context and like the big zoomed out view of like how big will that little bucket grow to be, that's why Sailor likes to use that chart because it it frames it nicely of this is the best store of value asset in human history. How much value in the world is just looking for the best store of value asset? And Sailor has said it's 50%. It's a guess, something like that. It's 50%. And he thinks that capital will continue to flow into Bitcoin until it reaches until it saturates pure store of value capital, which was up to 50% of all asset value in the world. You're going to have these massive buckets deflating relative to Bitcoin as Bitcoin massively inflates over the next several decades. And the conduits by which that happens will be Bitcoin treasury companies facilitating that flow of capital. And for that reason, I think that it's quite possible long explanation to get to this of I think that it's quite possible that Bitcoin treasury companies accumulate half of all Bitcoin during this period and 20 years from now using sailor's numbers of $13 million per coin in 20 years. That would make Bitcoin treasury companies that would mean that they would hold $140 trillion of Bitcoin. And I think like Strategy will end up owning half of that. So $70 trillion of Bitcoin, which would make Strategy the most valuable company in the history of the world by a very large margin. And and I think that the rest of that that the remaining 70 trillion dollars of Bitcoin held in Bitcoin treasury companies is going to be the big story in global finance for the next 20 years.

**Cedric:**
(0:42:08) Wow. What this connects the dots for me on is, you know, I've been wondering all along and I'll take my tin foil hat off here because I think there's a real reasonable explanation is that why is the United States government allowing Micro Strategy to accumulate all this Bitcoin and why are they nudging them forward? And I the conclusion I have come to is that they're not interested in buying Bitcoin, the United States government. They're not interested in buying an asset they can never sell because they would crash that market. They're not interested in marking up their gold and selling it. They're just they don't need another buy and hold asset. They need to sell the debt. That's why they want the reserves on treasuries so they can sell the treasury and capitalize on those flows. Um they need the Bitcoin market to go up so they could sell more treasuries to the stable coin companies. And so they need strategy to buy Bitcoin at 5 million per coin and they need strategy to be the refinery and they need all these companies to refine the Bitcoin into these markets so they can continue selling treasuries. It kind of answers that question for me. What do you think is also a big part of the next wave here? Is the is part of the endgame perpetual preferred debt issuance?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:43:07) It's just a natural evolution really. It's a it's a weird scary idea. What does this mean? But it's just a a really clever way to repackage typical debt issuance strategy was doing convertible note issuance. And that takes time. It takes months to set up your next convertible note. It's a it's an event. It's a an instrument. There's lots of paperwork prospectus. You have to go road show it to potential investors, gauge their interest, get soft commits, finalize the documents, announce it, launch it, collect hard commits, and then go collect the money for that and then issue those securities. And that's a big process. It takes months and you don't get to decide overnight that conditions are right for you to issue more debt. It several months of lead time and then they're not easily tradable. There's the there's a lot of friction for the issuer and for the investor. And I think also a big part of it is like there aren't many protections for the issuer for strategy. In a typical debt arrangement, the debt holder holds a ton of power baked into those debt covenants that you agree to in the contract and they can hold that over the issuer and cause problems. So, I think that strategy quickly learned that this is a pain in the ass to do it this way. And it'd be a lot easier if we could sell at the market the way that we're doing with a common stock with MSTR. If we could just sell it at the market like a new little slice of convertible debt, that would be amazing. And this is how you do that. you bundle it into a preferred equity vehicle that that the ownership rights of that share amount to the same benefits as convertible debt in the case of Strike, which was the first one they launched. And then Strife is just ordinary debt. Stride is a more junior ordinary debt. And now Stretch is it's a money market fund instrument that's that is itself packaged up into a preferred equity instrument. So these are just easier ways to issue more debt, more money market promises or convertible debt or ordinary debt in a way that you can do it the day that market conditions make it most attractive to do. And you can as the issuer set up the rights that that you think are best rather than having to follow debt covenant norms. and you can structure where it is in in where these instruments fall in terms of seniority in the capital stack. So, it's just a way better way to do this stuff. And and Sailor really pioneered it with lots of help from AI, which was a funny little anecdote he shared in in Orlando that these preferred equities are the first securities designed by AI because he was just hammering chat GBT to figure out how you could possibly do it when his securities lawyers were like, I don't know if this is possible. But then with AI he was able to get 80% of the way there something like that and then then the lawyers can figure out the details to make it possible.

**Cedric:**
(0:46:30) Sure. Do you think cuz it it seems like sailor going further and further out on the risk curve to appeal to different buyers and one part of the risk curve obviously would be stable coins at perceived 0% risk in the fiat world because they're linked to treasuries and things like that. Do you think a company like strategy will ever issue something like a stable coin andor a partnership with a tether or circle to if they can't because stable coins aren't backed by bitcoin in America right now? Do you see stable coins as part of this curve or this evolution being paired with Bitcoin treasury companies?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:47:15) Yeah, I haven't thought about that. It seems entirely possible, in fact, preferable to what do you want backing your dollar? I'd like it to be highly overcolateralized Bitcoin balance sheet. That'd be great. It does introduce what are the reasons why Tether is attractive to holders. And and part of the reason is that it's like that they sit outside of the US regulatory environment and and are a little bit defiant of US regulators. And that's actually attractive. If you're someone holding Tether in a developing world and you don't want it confiscated by the SEC at any point, a Tether is probably a better thing to hold as opposed to an SEC compliant vehicle. You know, that there's also that side of things, too. But yeah, there's no there's nothing stopping. I think this is why Sailor likes to use my chart of the global asset landscape is because it it visually gives you a map of here's where all the value is in the world in analog assets and Bitcoin's going going to demonetize to some extent every single one of these buckets. Some buckets more than others. Like the bond market is probably going to get massively demonetized, real estate maybe less, but still. And so it's a map that he's showing everybody here's where all the value sits and I'm going to go meet it with instruments designed to appeal to the value parked in each of these buckets designed to offer what that capital is looking for in that bucket but more right so like with bonds like rather than 10-year Treasury bill getting four and a half% sailor saying I'll give you 8 to 10% He's going to win market share because of that. And he's going to do the same thing in the money market now with Stretch. And he could design stuff. I don't know what this looks like, but he maybe he'll design something to appeal to real estate investors or certainly other slices of the bond market and money market and equities market probably are on the table for what he could construct using new preferred equities. And yeah, he's shaping the new yield curve by rebuilding what the traditional yield curve looks like. And there's still a lot of spots to fill in there. And I guess he's just going to keep doing it so long as there's new markets that are not currently being met by bitcoinbacked products because backing your product with Bitcoin makes it makes it so that you can pay more than anybody else with a fiatbacked product in all these categories. So, he's just going to keep doing that and that's why he's gonna ingest he's going to pump a huge portion of the world's capital through his business into Bitcoin and then hold that Bitcoin on the balance sheet.

**Cedric:**
(0:50:19) Yeah, it's interesting. If you think about every company's mining fiat, but if a Bitcoin company is mining fiat and they put an engineer in charge of the mining and he built a much better engine to refine the Bitcoin into the fiat market and I think of your chart as like a map of value in cyerspace or digital value in cyerspace and all money is really digital at this point. It's just in different buckets. But you think about the map being a map of cyerspace because Bitcoin's the black hole. Yes. And it's just pulling in all this other monetization that you see in these other buckets.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:50:53) Yeah, I like how you frame that. It's like a step change improvement in how do you generate value for shareholders? It's like going from whale oil to electric lamps. Let's let the engineer figure out what can we do with digital capital to benefit shareholders the most rather than just like adhering to this triedand-rue model of let's just generate operating profits every year into the future and that's how we'll do it. And this engineer has said, "Okay, I think the most undervalued thing in the world is digital capital, and I'm going to figure out how to get people to give me money so that I can buy more digital capital." That's as simple as it is. And that's the playbook he's pioneered. And there's nothing stopping that from happening everywhere in the world until Bitcoin has fully monetized to whatever its end state is. Like climb the scurve up to its full monetization. Is that 50% of the world's asset value? Maybe that's the end state. Maybe that's on the high end in my book. Maybe it's 20%. It's not 0.2% which is what we're still at currently.

**Cedric:**
(0:51:59) I think the epiphany I think for Sailor and that's playing out here is and it's an epiphany a lot of us have had about how the economy works. It's sad that the economy works like this. This is how it works. People are making more money like Sailor realized in in the dotcom era or the mobile era that he was making more from putting 50 million of his own money at risk than he could draw from putting 2,000 people's labor at risk. And 2,000 people a year were pulling in 50 million a year. and the 50 million he put into play, he was able to turn into 500 million. And just by betting on things like Apple and he realized that the hour a month he spent managing that 50 million had so much more creative of results than the remaining time he was putting into running the business. And now he gets that hour a month, but now it's the whole month. And we're letting him we're going to let him cook. and he's coming up with all these ways to say, you know, to to increase the leverage and the torque,

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:53:05) letting them cook with a with an AI assistant. Yeah, sure. However you're going to cook and maybe not everything sticks forever when you throw the spaghetti against the wall, but when you find those things that do, there are large pools of capital here that are trapped.

**Cedric:**
(0:53:17) What kind of how do you think M&A is going to evolve? Obviously, there's some early stage M&A with the way these companies are getting launched from the private sphere into the public sphere, but you haven't seen is it going to be like going up the food chain the way the early M&A has and is it going to be Meta Planet maybe buying a smarter web or vice versa to form an alliance to get bigger or is it micro strategy looking around and saying do we buy a meta planet andor a smarter web for our own reasons or things like that?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:53:47) Yeah, great question. I don't know. We'll see. I do think that there's going to be So, inevitably, there's going to be Bitcoin treasure companies that get out over their skis, take on too much debt, too much leverage, get in trouble in a bare market, get into distress. Some will get attacked by opportunistic hedge funds looking to short sell. And there's going to be consolidations probably that happen of distressed balance sheets, but there's Bitcoin sitting there and there will be conditions where, you know, a larger Bitcoin treasury company acquiring that Bitcoin makes sense. And so we'll see that stuff happen. No idea how that'll evolve. I do think that I think that's part of what's going on right now is there's a race to be the leader in each capital market because if you can get to scale with a clean balance sheet, start offering these preferred equities, but a large enough clean balance sheet that puts you in just a fantastic position to be that refinery for that geography, right? and hoover up that capital in the b in the fixed income market and the overvalued equities market and and refine it into Bitcoin. And I don't think that there's going to maybe there will be, but I doubt there will be mergers between those capital market leaders. Maybe that's like the least lowhanging fruit really. I think that those leadership positions will I think they'll end up being the most valuable companies in each capital market. It's not too hard to imagine strategy becoming the most valuable company in the US. That that's just a function of Bitcoin's price going to a million dollars. I think that would do it right there. And would that do it? No, that would be 600 whatever. At some point, Strategy will be, I think, the most valuable company in the US. At some point, I think Metaplanet it'll will continue to accumulate Bitcoin and we'll end up being the most valuable company in Japan. I think that smarter web is nothing is certain, but we are currently on a path to be the leading and winning Bitcoin treasury company in the UK. And I think whoever is the winner in the UK has a chance to accumulate 1% of all Bitcoin because that's a big capital market and these are going to ingest a huge amount of capital from the capital market they're in. So, whoever wins in the UK will end up being the most valuable company in the UK by a lot. And I I think that Smarter Web is on that path currently. And I'm very excited about that potential and want to execute on that possible future. Yeah. So, I think that's how this plays out. M&A will be a part of that story. It's hard to know in in what flavors and how that'll shape up, but those will probably happen during times of distress, if I had to guess. consolidation of players when the weaker ones get in trouble and the stronger ones have the balance sheet to acquire them maybe with all stock transactions and it's accretive to both sides.

**Cedric:**
(0:56:46) I have only a couple more questions for you. We'll talk about maybe adoption. Why are we seeing companies like Metaplanet Smarter Web Company adopt the Bitcoin Treasury strategy? Well, if every company just went on a Bitcoin treasury strategy, we wouldn't need coin treasury companies. But why haven't companies like Apple or Microsoft or Amazon and when would you expect them to jump on board?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:57:14) Yeah, my view here is it's a common misconception. People assume that tech companies will get Bitcoin and will adopt it as a treasured asset. I think that the largest companies in the world will be some of the last companies in the world to really meaningfully adopt Bitcoin as a treasured asset. And of course, there's different flavors of adoption here, right? like you can put 5% of your treasury in Bitcoin and forget about it the way that Tesla has done and that isn't really meaningful. The the next sort of archetype in my mind is you put the majority of your treasury in Bitcoin most of it and that's how you store your value. That's how you stop the melting ice cube that sailor originally. But that was the start of what he did. But then he figured out actually I can borrow this depreciating currency and to buy this appreciating currency. And that's a great idea. And so he started down that path. But so there's going to be companies that put a little bit in. There's going to be companies that adopt it as their primary. And there's going to be companies that that adopt it as their goal. to increase Bitcoin per share over time. And in my mind, that's what constitutes a Bitcoin treasury company the way that we talk about them, not the first two categories. You have to have this committed goal of growing Bitcoin per share over time. And that needs to that needs to be your mandate from shareholders. That's what you're focused on as a business. And if you're Apple or Microsoft, you can't you just can't get there because you are too profitable, too big of a business, too successful to switch to this alternative goal of growing Bitcoin per share. So companies that are very profitable, companies that are cash cows have a lot of reasons to not become Bitcoin treasury companies and to not adopt Bitcoin as a treasury asset in general. things have been working too well for them. Why change it? So, we've seen how strategy Sailor described them themselves, their business as a zombie company. They were going to go out of business. It was just a matter of time. Metaplanet was a failing hotel business. In Smarter Web's case, it was a private business that didn't on its own necessitate or justify going public. But with the goal of increasing Bitcoin per share, it made sense to go public and taking that leap to transform as a business from just a modest web design operating business to a modest web design operating business who happens to aggressively be adding Bitcoin per share as their treasury strategy. Yeah. So, I think it's a misconception that like we're not going to see the big tech companies adopting Bitcoin as a treasury asset. It's going to be every other company, every company that needs to change their fortunes first and then eventually you're going to work your way up the stack and then finally the lagards will be the cash cow very profitable businesses that don't have the necessity of change.

**Cedric:**
(0:60:21) Uh, this has been so dope, Jesse. I really appreciate you coming on, spending time breaking all this down. I love this topic if you couldn't tell.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:60:27) Well, we'll have to do it again. I love it as well.

**Cedric:**
(0:60:33) I think my final question then looking forward, if you looked at the bull run of 2017, the fall and the winter were really big aspects of that. And there was this frenzy that was just kinetic and most of it was retail driven. But I think one of the insights you could draw here is if there's going to be a frenzy this fall and winter, it's going to be maybe from Bitcoin treasury companies. What do you And I think I also think it seems like it's a very crucial time in in their formulation to kind of and proliferation and success would be the next 6 to9 months. So, how do you see the six the next 6 to9 months for these companies? And do you think there's going to be any sort of frenzy like atmosphere amongst these companies?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:61:16) It's such a good question. Sailor has the perspective that we're not going to see the same kind of bare markets in the future, which would mean that we're not going to see the same kind of frenzy that precedes a bare market. It's very interesting actually that in a way we just had a frenzy and it was smaller and shortlived. Bitcoin Treasury companies globally had quite a sharp MNAV expansion that peaked about a month ago and it's been a rather brutal MNAV compression sectorwide for the last month. And obviously I'm paying a lot of attention to studying this stuff and how MetPanet what their trajectory looked like over the last 15 months. They've had four of these cycles already. And having been in Bitcoin for several cycles, I see the pattern recognition of it's just like a Bitcoin 4-year cycle but compressed by 12x. So it's instead of a 2-year bare market and recovery, it's two months. And Metaplan's[61:16] sort of frenzy like atmosphere amongst these companies? It's such a good question. Sailor has [61:22] the perspective that we're not going to see the same kind of bare markets in the future, which would mean that we're not [61:28] going to see the same kind of frenzy that precedes a bare market. It's very interesting actually that in a way we [61:35] just had a frenzy and it was smaller and shortlived. Bitcoin Treasury companies [61:40] globally had quite a sharp MNAV expansion that peaked about a month ago [61:46] and it's been a rather brutal MNAV compression sectorwide for the last [61:52] month. And obviously I'm paying a lot of attention to studying this stuff and how [61:58] MetPanet what their trajectory looked like over the last 15 months. They've had four of these cycles already. And [62:06] having been in Bitcoin for several cycles, I see the pattern recognition of it's just like a Bitcoin 4-year cycle [62:13] but compressed by 12x. So it's instead of a 2-year bare market and recovery, [62:19] it's two months. And Metaplan's gone through in 15 months, they've had [62:22] Volatility as vitality vs TradFi’s downside skew [62:24] several of these cycles. And the most recent one was this spring. They shot out of a cannon out of nowhere after [62:31] months of consolidation and have peaked and are now going through the same consolidation phase and [62:38] smarter web is maybe doing the same thing as what it feels like having gone through Bitcoin cycles before like I'm

**Cedric:**
[62:44] seeing all of the same sentiment and all the same emotions and patterns too on [62:50] the chart. It's pure price dis price discovery to the upside crescendoing in [62:56] blowoff top and then your classic like finding equilibrium after that. [63:02] Meanwhile, speaking about smarter web, we continue to add Bitcoin per share. [63:07] So, we're our NAV per share is growing through this whole process. We've since [63:12] the peak over just over a month ago, we've more than 4xed the amount of [63:19] Bitcoin that we hold. And meanwhile, the stock price is like 50% what it was, [63:25] something like that. So in that sense, the fundamentals for Bitcoin treasury [63:30] companies can quite rapidly improve. And I think that is part of how the the [63:36] market has to digest more rapidly. So these upside shocks [63:41] happen and then the crashes after that, but consolidation has to be pretty quick [63:47] because this floor is like marching upwards in terms of what's the right valuation of this company based on the [63:52] Bitcoin assets held per share. And that that just keeps marching upwards. And I think that's looking back at what [63:59] happened with MetaPlanet, the same pattern, right, of like these upside shocks happened, crashes, consolidation, [64:06] they kept adding Bitcoin and eventually it didn't make sense for the price to

**Jesse Myers:**
[64:12] not go up because you're valuing the Bitcoin per share there and then the [64:17] cycle repeats again. And they've done that several times. So I think that I think it's quite possible that the [64:24] advent of the Bitcoin treasury company globally, this trend globally is going [64:30] to cause the same thing that we've seen with Metaplanet but happening all over the world and maybe they end up sinking [64:36] up as they did over the last few months worldwide enthusiasm expansions and [64:42] contractions. And then the tide goes out, you find out who's been swimming naked. The healthy companies continue to [64:45] Mindset shift: humans are volatile, Bitcoin is programmatic [64:48] add Bitcoin. their nav per share keeps marching upwards and then the next cycle [64:53] happens and that could be what colors this current Bitcoin cycle and it could [65:00] be it could quite significantly change how this feels over the next 6 to9 [65:07] months and possibly beyond if Sailor is right. They just bought 20,000 Bitcoin [65:13] by by launching a new product to meet money market fund capital where it's at [65:19] and they ingested over $2 billion by just by launching Stretch, plowed it [65:25] right into Bitcoin to buy 20,000 Bitcoin in one day. That changes the dynamics [65:31] here. As these little conduits for flowing capital out of these big buckets

**Cedric:**
[65:37] continue to be added and expanded, the pipes get bigger and we're going to see [65:40] Closing thoughts [65:42] more and more demand, more and more capital flowing into Bitcoin through these things. It's it I my baseline is [65:50] to continue to expect a bare market, but maybe it's a 60% bare market. Maybe it's [65:55] a 50% bare market and then doesn't really feel like a bare market anymore. That's just Bitcoin doing its thing. So, [66:02] we'll see how it all plays out. But I think that looking forward for the next 20 years, I think Bitcoin treasury [66:08] companies are going to be a big part of demand for Bitcoin and how Bitcoin [66:14] continues to march into the mainstream of global adoption and yeah, the es and flows of enthusiasm [66:22] for Bitcoin treasury company valuations and those MNABs could be we could be [66:29] having bare markets on a very compressed time scale and not really realize that we're no longer in a 4year time scale [66:38] paradigm anymore. Now we're this is going to keep happening every few months. That could be really exciting. [66:43] We'll see if that's the case. But these two things are going to there's some interplay between them of like Bitcoin's [66:49] kind of four-year cadence and these Bitcoin Treasury companies because of their fundamentals improving rapidly [66:56] every few months imposing a a fourmonth cycle. And so Bitcoin's four-year cycle [67:03] and Bitcoin treasury companies four month cycles are going to meet in some messy way and we'll see how it plays

**Jesse Myers:**
[67:09] out. Yeah. I mean traditional markets tend to have their sort of like quarterly cycles. Yeah. And there, you know, winter's good, [67:16] summer's bad. Watching all this play out, I don't subscribe to people, but I [67:21] like the idea of listening to people who have great ideas. And some of the most [67:26] interesting Bitcoiners, and when I say interesting here, people who really are great at running the numbers and seeing [67:32] how things play out are getting involved in Bitcoin Treasury companies. I don't think there's a need a real need to name [67:38] names here, but you're involved. Joe Bernett's involved. He's been on the [67:44] show a couple times. Dylan's involved. Dylan's been on the show. Jeff Walton [67:49] getting involved. And I would add, Adam Back is possibly the most bullish out of anybody. And you [67:54] know, now Adam's always super bullish, but he's a really smart thinker and he's [68:00] really interested in the corporate aspects of Bitcoin adoption. He's been a [68:05] big supporter and prognosticator and he's very bullish. So you have Adam Back who's been on the show. I think Stefan [68:12] Leva is getting involved. He intimated that on the last show. Just Jeff Walton, Ben over at Swan. I do think that this [68:19] has been incredible conversation for people who've enjoyed this. I think they should go back to our prior conversations. I think there's a lot of [68:25] value there. So, you were on episode 128, but we are so early few. For people [68:30] that don't, I don't know how people would know this, but I purposely put that one out right before Michael Sailor came on the show. So, I said to myself,

**Cedric:**
[68:37] if Sailor listens to any episode before he comes on, it would probably be the one right before his. He would just go to the And it was yours. He mentioned [68:43] that and I think there's a nice connection there. He told me in when I saw him in person that he doesn't often [68:49] watch a full podcast episode, but he watched that full one that you and I did years ago right before he came on your [68:55] show. Yeah. And he was able to repeat some of it back to me when on our chat. You were [69:00] also on 237 which was very recent. This is a species defining moment where you go over your piece once in a species. [69:07] And you were also on the group chat group therapy episode 214 with VJ Boyati [69:13] and Joe Bernett. and we talked about the US Bitcoin reserve and why this changes everything and we kind of went through a [69:18] little group therapy session when Bitcoin was a little down and out for a little bit there in the spring. It will be interesting to see how this plays [69:24] out. Hopefully, it was just a slow grind up max pain and we're more in just traditional cycles of finance and it's [69:31] slow grind up but and you have some volatility. One thing I think you also noted in your recent conversation with [69:37] Preston is we talk about how volatility is vitality, but in traditional finance [69:42] historically volatility has been a negative or skewed negative and I think that's hard for them to grasp. The way [69:48] you shed light on what's hard for traditional finance to grasp is very interesting. Yeah, that's such a core idea that so I [69:57] credit Mark Connors for his work on this topic. Basically, if you look at the histogram [70:03] of each day of what was the performance for Bitcoin on each every single day and

**Jesse Myers:**
[70:09] add that up into histogram, the the mean skews to the right and it's driven [70:16] largely by some volatile days that are positive to the upside. And that is [70:22] different than any other asset where the volatile days tend to skew to the downside. That's how it is in Trady. [70:30] Bitcoin's volatility is to the upside. That makes sense to us, right? We understand that 16 years of up and down [70:38] days, but we've ended up a lot higher. And so, it's good volatility. It's good volatility. You want that. Tradfi is [70:45] unprepared for rationalizing that, for understanding that with Bitcoin, the [70:51] volatility is the key and you want it. And Bitcoin treasury companies take that [70:56] same idea and compound it because you are accumulating. You are literally compounding the amount of Bitcoin held [71:03] per share over time. That's the idea, the strategy of it. And so you're [71:09] creating that much more volatility. You're you're squaring roughly the [71:14] volatility, the good volatility of Bitcoin's positively skewed volatility. [71:20] That comes with the territory. And I and that's important for anybody who thinks about investing in Bitcoin Treasury [71:25] companies to understand that's what you're signing up for. You want that volatility because it skews to the [71:32] upside and you can't have that price discovery to the upside that MetPanet has had without having volatility and [71:39] that comes with some painful downside but it's part of the market digesting

**Cedric:**
[71:44] the upside so that you can do it all again. Yeah. No, that's the three things you run up to in in sort of fiat world or [71:51] it's nothing lasts forever. What goes up must come down and it's too volatile. And I just want to be like shut the [ __ ] [71:57] up. Everything in your life is too volatile. Your job, your career, your house, your everything you're paying for [72:03] is volatile. Everything you're doing is volatile. And and and but they're saying, hey, you know, at least my money [72:08] just kills me slowly. The last thing I need because they hear volatility and it's like, oh, that's going to die. Everything that goes up goes down. I'm [72:15] gonna buy at the top and I'm just gonna experience negative volatility. But it's just it's really hard to cross that [72:20] chasm. Uh because of the embedded historical uh Rashard has a good line on [72:25] that. He says that Bitcoin isn't volatile. Humans are volatile and how they interact with Bitcoin is volatile. [72:32] But Bitcoin's quite certain because it's just going to do what it's going to do in terms of its supply function every [72:38] day and every four years. And it's just human psychology layering on top of that that brings the volatility. [72:44] Yeah, Pierre Rashard's another one accounting guy running the numbers. Been on the show four or five times. Please check out our prior chats, too. Jesse, I [72:51] have to have you back on in the fall. We'll have to book it soon. Smarter Web currently has 250 Bitcoin. [72:59] I'll come back on in a few months and we'll see how many Bitcoin we have. Yeah. And we'll have to get together in [73:04] person. I can't wait to see you. Next time you're in Key West, hit me up. I'll drive down. I'm going down to the Keys this weekend with my son to do some [73:10] fishing. Next time I'll drive, I'll meet you or you'll come. You'll stay in the trailer. We'll record a rip and we'll go
