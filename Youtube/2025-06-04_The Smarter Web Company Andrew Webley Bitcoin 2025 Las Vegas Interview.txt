**Interviewer:**
(0:00:00) In today's episode, I'm here in Vegas with Andrew Webbley at Bitcoin 2025. Let's have a look at what's coming up. And I saw him over to the other side, so I thought, "Oh, I'll go and say hello." Um, so I went up to him and he knew my company name before I even said it to him. Wow. Which was weird. Obviously, you're not just here for for the conference itself, you know, the the talks and things like that. One of the reasons is is to try and meet uh potential investors. How's that going?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:00:30) So, I've spent the whole day from about 9:15 this morning meetings. That's why I was 10 minutes late to see you and it's going pretty well. Um, being transparent about it. You know, one or two you think, you know, aren't aren't right, you know, but that doesn't mean to say that they won't be right in the future. I'm pleased with the start that we've made. I've got my own targets, which I've shared before. I believe that we're on track. Nothing's a dead in in in life or or in investing. I'll be disappointed if I can't beat the targets that I've set myself. The acceleration that we've got is exactly as illustrated in the charts. I.e., you know, the fastest, best, whatever you want to call it. Every everyone in the UK holds Bitcoin whe they like it or not. Slice of it. Yeah, that's great. Yeah. And if you do things in the right way, then people support you and they give you a chance and then that allows you to raise better capital on better terms um to then grow the business further.

**Interviewer:**
(0:01:30) [Music] Andrew, thank you so much for taking the time out of uh of the conference to to to talk to me today. Firstly, how are you finding Las Vegas and is it your first time here?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:01:45) Yeah. So, Las Vegas is a crazy place. Um, hotels are massive. Literally everything is there in the hotel for you. You know, shops, food, you know, cafes. With the Bitcoin conference going on in the hotel, it is right up my street. I'm not sure whether it would be somewhere that I would go without the conference element. So, I think with a conference with a subject matter that you absolutely love, it's great. But um I'm not sure whether I'll be rushing back for for other things, but it's it's been the best couple of days that I've had for a very long time.

**Interviewer:**
(0:02:15) And how was it meeting Michael Sailor?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:02:18) It was odd, actually. So, um you know, I've been investing in strategy for many years. You know, I I've listened to so many things that he said. You know, it I I see everything that he puts out on X. So, I went up to him after we did this um this talk um which was a UTXO private event. That was on Monday, wasn't it?

**Interviewer:**
(0:02:35) Yeah, Monday.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:02:36) Yeah, Monday. And there was about um I don't know 300 400 people in in the crowd. You know, some of them I knew already, some of them I didn't know. I sat on the stage with you know companies that I look up to. Um so anyway with the the talk had finished um you know chatting to a few people and and I saw him over to the other side. So I thought oh I'll go and say hello. Um so I went up to him and he knew my company name before I even said it to him. Wow. Which was weird. That's pretty cool though. Yeah. Yeah. Really cool. Um really cool. And if you had said to me four weeks ago, you know, I would have told you to stop winding me up, you know. Um and and you know, he's just been so good for the whole um for the whole sector um that it was, you know, genuinely, you know, awesome to meet him. Brilliant. And you know, he'd obviously done his homework before meeting you.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:03:20) Well, so some of my American friends have been saying to me the last couple of weeks, you know, can't wait for you to come over to Vegas. You know, everyone's talking about you and all this sort of stuff. And I believed them because you know what they tell me is 99% of the time true. But I also couldn't really believe it. Um and then you know that you know I was sat watching David Bailey chat you know the other the other day or yesterday I think you know he mentions our company. you know, they're they're genuinely, you know, you can see from what he puts on X and things, but it's a very difficult thing to describe, but you you you you almost don't want to get your hopes up because cuz you you believe that you're working really hard and you believe that everyone's getting behind you and and you can see the future so so clearly, but it's still that strange stage. Even though I, you know, see the volume that goes through the stock, you know, the price action, you know, the the people that are asking me for meetings and things, you still think, you know, do they really know about the company? and and obviously they all do. Um but yeah, it's it's um strange but cool. It's almost like you've got to experience it before it can be real.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:04:15) Yeah. Yeah. Um yeah, I can't really describe it other than it's really strange, you know, like, you know, I'm I'm so proud of the company that I set up and, you know, I've worked so hard, you know, for many years on it and and I'm working harder than ever now and to see all these other people interested in it is, you know, it's it's awesome.

**Interviewer:**
(0:04:30) Yeah. Well, good for you because you know that's that's where the hard work gets you, isn't it?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:04:35) Yeah. Yeah. Hopefully. I I had dinner last night with um two um people that you know invested in in the IPO that um so the IPO was part retail, part private, you know, people can see that information if they read all the announcements. Um and and two of them wanted to, you know, take me out for a meal, which was which was nice. And it was it was just really nice chatting to them and they were saying, you know, this is, you know, life-changing amounts of money, you know, for for the future, you know, they haven't sold any shares and and because they believe like I do in what we're doing. Um, and it was it was just amazing cuz they're amazing people, you know, and and and it's it's nice to see other people that want to support you, then, you know, providing we carry on on the trajectory that I hope we are, you know, sort of do well. Really, that's what it's all about.

**Interviewer:**
(0:05:15) Brilliant. So I mean obviously you're not just here for for the conference itself you know the the talks and things like that. One of the reasons is is to try and meet uh potential investors. How's that going?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:05:25) So I've spent the whole day from about 9:15 this morning um meetings. That's why I was 10 minutes late to see you and it's going pretty well. Um being transparent about it. You know one or two you think you know aren't aren't right. you know, but that doesn't mean to say that they won't be right in the future. You know, one of them was was amazing. Um there's more meetings later today and tonight um and then tomorrow morning before I leave. So, um yeah, so far so good.

**Interviewer:**
(0:05:50) Fantastic. we as a community have have kind of we've been coming up with different ways to display metrics and things like that and uh Bitcoin B21 Nick has um has certainly led the charge on that front. his uh sort of speed of accumulation uh chart um which compares uh SWC to its competitors. Well, not competitors, it's it's peers, that's the word. And you know, it it kind of looks quite favorable on S SWC side. Firstly, what's what are your impressions of of it? Um and do you think we can keep ahead of like MetaPlanet's pace because at the moment we're the fastest growing um Bitcoin treasury?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:06:20) Yes. So, I'm pleased with the start that we've made. I've got my own targets, which I've shared before. Um, I believe that we're on track. Um, nothing's a a dead in in in life or or in investing. I'll be disappointed if I can't beat the targets that I've set myself. The acceleration that we've got is, you know, exactly as illustrated in the charts. I, you know, the fastest, best, whatever you want to call it. anyone can look at our um cash position and make assumptions from there which is um quite cool you know in in sort of you know what's it a few days over a month now it won't take much to you know to get to that that that that target that we all want to see you know um I like his uh you know sort of time to target the percentage on there will obviously change as as time goes on so yeah I think I I think we'll get there I'm not sure what number he'll set it to after a th00and though maybe he'll set it to 2,000 maybe 5,000. Um, setting it from 1,000 to 5,000 is quite a big jump, you see, but might be more sensible than 2,000, you know. So, I guess we get to 1,000 and then we see where we go from there.

**Interviewer:**
(0:07:15) Yeah. And and maybe we base it off what your next target is when when you decide and go, okay, we've made it to a thousand.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:07:22) I think I think we go for five. Or, you know, actually, yeah, let's let's stick with the two. Yeah, I I probably lean more towards the five than the two, but um let's let's get to 1,000 and and and and take it from there, you know, like we we just want to keep the pace, you know, working every day to, you know, deliver the mission. Um and then, you know, when we tick these sort of different milestones off, then we'll we'll see where we go from there.

**Interviewer:**
(0:07:45) Well, obviously, you know, the the the share price and the and the market cap has grown well in in my opinion astonishingly quickly. Maybe maybe it's what you expected. I'm not sure. But with it having you know in a month's time gone up 40 times is that right?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:08:00) Yeah approximately rough roughly.

**Interviewer:**
(0:08:02) Does that put more impetus on the the the uplifting and you know does it change the timelines at all? Is it kind of it it just is this long? It takes this long or is there you know room to maneuver in that because of the the rapid growth that we've seen?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:08:18) Yeah. So that's a good question. Um, so what I've been told by our advisers is that to move to a different market, should we choose to do it, would take between four and six months. You know, it's not a dead. There's a process, you know, and, you know, a cost to it. I've been thinking about it a lot these last few days and I think it's something that we'll probably explore. When you get on to the main board as opposed to aquis, you get tracker funds, which are probably the most exciting part of that. So like the passive inflows from the funds.

**Interviewer:**
(0:08:45) Yeah. So so if you speak to a fund manager that manages money on a discretionary basis then they choose if they want to invest in you or not. If you get onto the say the footsie 250, the Footsie 100, you know, any of these indexes then the you know the computer that that makes the decision does it based on allocation you know like so the flows are quite vast and it's quite funny because you know you could find yourself in a position where almost everyone in the UK has got some Bitcoin exposure because almost everyone's got some allocation to these sorts of trackers. So obviously that's not the primary driver, but it would be quite quite cool.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:09:15) Yeah, I think that would that would certainly give you a bit of a smile. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. To know these every everyone in the UK holds Bitcoin whether they like it or not. Slice of it. Yeah, that's great. Yeah, I like that a lot. Um, so just to clarify though with regards uplifting, are you thinking you know skip AIM?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:09:30) Oh yeah, we will not list the business on AIM for reasons that you know aren't really worth sort of going going into. You know, AIM is no no better. In fact, maybe worse than Aquis because it's more expensive. Liquidity. Well, I think we we've sort of put the liquidity thing to bed now.

**Interviewer:**
(0:09:45) We could you just talk a little bit more about that because um you know, it was it was viewed as one of the downsides to Aquas.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:09:52) Yeah. Well, you know, I I think it just comes down to what the business is. you know, if you're, you know, a business that, you know, is working hard, is communicating with its shareholders, that offers some potential and, you know, all these other things, then, you know, I think it's a refreshing change to what is, you know, not the most interesting market as a whole, i.e. London. You know, I I think well, the the facts speak for themselves, don't they? So, you know, today uh when I checked earlier, it's quite a volatile day actually, but we traded almost 5 million pounds worth of stock. Uh previous day I think we traded over5 million pounds worth of stock. You know, we're consistently trading more than the rest of the market combined. Um we're probably trading maybe not quite in the the when you add the two markets together, the top 100, but probably in the top 100 to 150. Um so, you know, we've we've I think we've proved that the liquidity side of things doesn't really matter. You know, the market makers like it because there's volume. So when you get volume the spread decreases um which is really important. So if what people want to buy or if people want to sell um that's quite good. So yeah I think we've you know we we've proved that liquidity isn't isn't necessarily reflective of the market and and reading between the lines there. It sounds like we're we're bringing uh excitement back to UK markets.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:11:00) Yeah, I think so. And and you know that's really important. You know, I get a lot of phone calls and emails from, you know, people who seem to be getting up the the visibility side of things. You know, I bumped into a a hedge fund manager actually when I was um at the conference earlier today. Um and he was telling me about his boss who runs billions of pounds. um that his his um you know one of the other managers that he knows was asking him whether he he had sort of looked into SWC and then he asked you know the guy that I know uh who works within that fund um about it who um you know clearly does and yeah it's just nice to see people know about it you know and I think if the government's message is that they want innovative companies that are working hard that are trying to present you know the right approach about what we're doing in in the UK UK. I you know I I hope that we're playing some small part in that. I've I've seen messages from people saying you know it's great I don't have to wait for America to open anymore. You know the stock market's become interesting again. No FX fees. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. And it's also having you know it's it's it's having a company you know that's that's you know part of you know you you know part of you know your country and stuff. So you know that's why if you look across the world you know people I I think people would prefer to invest in the UK um on the whole but the opportunities haven't been there. Um you know you look at like tech companies which obviously something that I'm very fond of. You know I can't I can't even name off the top of my head you know a great tech company that's come out of the UK. You know if I if you really pushed me on it I'd probably have to say my former employer because you could class that as a tech company. But what happened there? it got sold. Yeah. Because the market didn't value it apparently appropriately and then it got sold to an overseas consortium. So yeah, I would I would hope that you know um at some point you know the you know the sort of the momentum continues may maybe we get other companies you know whether they're doing something similar to us or something different where people say oh actually there's a different way of doing this. we can, you know, we can, you know, sort of not try and do the usual public market thing where they, you know, effectively rip the company off, you know, give themselves loads of free shares and all these things that I can't stand, you know, and and and and if you do things in the right way, then people support you and they give you a chance and then that allows you to raise better capital on better terms um to then grow the business further. So, yeah, it's it's good.

**Interviewer:**
(0:13:30) Yeah, I know. I certainly enjoyed your ethos of looking after the retail side of things. Um, well, if you think about us, it feels quite refreshing to be honest.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:13:40) Yeah. Well, look at us. Those those three raises that we've done since we've listed, not one has been done at a discount. You know, they've they've been better prices each time. Um, the raise that we did uh last week was uh 81% approximately better price, almost double the amount. So, you know, it it says it all, you know. Um, you know, we've got a really good cash position at the moment. Um, which obviously will be deployed using our treasury management strategies. I read uh a lot of comments online about um, you know, when you're going to do your next raise and things, but you know, other than saying to people that I'll try and keep it interesting because, you know, I don't really want people trading against the company for the expense of the shareholders, you know, I think that's a bit off. you know, if you know that I'm endeavoring to do things at the market price, you know, why should you lower it to then try and save a couple of pennies? You know, it's it's not right. So, luckily with my experience, I can see some of that. Yeah. And and and I just keep trying to mix it up a little bit, you know, the approaches that we take and and um I think everyone will be pleasantly surprised.

**Interviewer:**
(0:14:45) Will we be waiting long for the next one?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:14:47) I couldn't possibly say on that. the the the only promise um that I could probably say is that, you know, we'll we'll keep doing our best. If somebody offered us a load of money, you know, tomorrow, um we'd potentially take it. If that doesn't happen, then, you know, we we won't um you know, do we need money in the next week? No. Do we need it in the next month? No. Do we need it in the next year? No. So, we'll only take the right capital at the right time, but you know, clearly we want to, you know, keep our trajectory growing. Um but it's it's got to be absolutely everything's got to be done for the benefit of the shareholders, you know, where wherever possible.

**Interviewer:**
(0:15:15) Yeah. So there's there's there's bigger picture things in other than just growth rate, right?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:15:20) Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, why does somebody invest in a company? Well, normally it's so that they can get a share price appreciation, right? You know, and and often that doesn't happen. Um, so with our business, with our different pillars that we've got in there, you know, we we've got, you know, clear strategies for, you know, what we're doing that's all being clearly communicated, but you know, you you you want the capital that's going to be accredited to the the existing shareholders, you know, so um you know, as as we move forward from here, you know, there's there's more options there as well, and you know, we'll we'll we'll keep doing our best on that.

**Interviewer:**
(0:15:50) Fantastic. um a little bit again on the the the sort of community side of things as that's kind of my my focus. Do you think kind of having the community and and that sort of retail investor hub of people helps with the institutional side as well because they can see that you've got the retail support and and that people are actually p passionate about it and and that kind of thing.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:16:10) Yeah, massively. What institutions want you know other than the obvious things like a good business, well run, etc. is they want a liquid stock. So the community is absolutely critical because it adds to the interest and the liquidity and it allows people to share opinions some of which you know sometimes I might not agree with but you know that's free speech right so yeah it's it's mega important and you know it's one of the coolest parts of what's happened so far so yeah it's really really important because institutions will not invest in a stock that's got poor liquidity because they need to to understand that should they wish to take some of their money off the table then they can do that. They can actually do that. Yeah. Yeah. So that that's the problems why like a small company that's not very good that hasn't got any liquidity. You know if you're going to make an investment in something what you probably want to do is you want to look at a longer term liquidity. I know we've only got four or five weeks of of previous data but you can see where the trend is. So what you'll see with a lot of companies is that the liquidity might spike sometimes. you know, for example, if they do a discounted placing or sort of a spoofy sort of RNS and then it will drop right down again. So, um you know, the institutions look at liquidity um instantly. Yeah. Yeah. And and we've got liquidity. Now, I had a chat actually to some investors earlier today and and I was showing them um you know, how the liquidity has changed and and I I've got no idea if if like the liquidity is almost off the chart already for you know, a smaller company. You know, I'm really looking forward to what the liquidity looks like in one week, two week, three weeks, four weeks. You know, bearing in mind that we've got the OTC all being well, coming on live, you know, in the not too distant future. Um the the liquidity, um not that we need any more liquidity, but you know, the more liquid the better. So, it's it's going to be really interesting to watch that.

**Interviewer:**
(0:18:00) Yeah, fantastic. the speaking of the OCQB being out in Vegas, you know, American investors can get access to SWC at the moment, but um you know, it's not easy. Has there been much chatter of people you've spoken to, you know, um asking about whether they can just buy the shares or have you sensed any the sort of hunger there from the maybe the small more less institutional and more retail side?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:18:25) I've actually had a lot of UK people come up to me um which is strange and you know recognize me and you know say that they're a shareholder or say that they're looking to buy some shares. You know I've had a I've had a you know a sort of another UK company that's a competitor you know sort of you know you know say how great it is what what we're doing and stuff. So, you know, I've I've I've been told this by UK people from some of the Americans, you know, the ones that I know reasonably well, they've said, you know, that, you know, this is sort of impeding in their sleep patterns slightly. Um, you know, cuz they spend a lot of time on the Aquis website. Um, you know, and I' I've said to them, you know, that's great, but just, you know, remember that shares do go down as well as up. You know, like obviously we all hope that the long-term trajectory is up, but that's not something that I control. I control the work that I put in and and and then the market reacts accordingly. So, so we've had some good feedback. I think specifically on US retail investors. Yes. You know, people that are determined can buy it now. Um and everyone can see some of the comments on X and things like that. So, they can see that and that's quite unusual. Um which shows you that sort of pent-up demand. But you you wait and see when it's when it's listed on the OTC so that people can just buy it easily. you know, it'll be quite incredible. Um, and then the other thing that you've got with a company like ours where you've got an aspect of digital assets is when the American market closes, which is, you know, sort of, um, you know, evening UK time. Um, and then, you know, those market makers, you know, any trades, they've they've got to hold them overnight. You know, when Bitcoin moves, you know, up or down, um, you know, then they have to lay those those positions in the morning. it it certainly won't um reduce um the volatility. So, you know, I think anyone that chooses to invest in our company needs to understand that, you know, this is what we believe in and that um you know, it is a volatile share. Um but, you know, as I say to everyone that I speak to, you know, i.e. my family, you know, if you want performance, you've got to accept volatility.

**Interviewer:**
(0:20:15) You know, I'll probably misquote this, but yesterday in your your showcase, uh you said something along the lines of we're only just getting started or or along those lines. Um, I had a this is a secondhand conversation uh with a Tradfire person that I was told about where they said, um, look, if you're looking at a stock that's gone up 30 to 40x in 4 weeks since its IPO, you've probably missed the boat or it's not going to go much further and you should be considering selling, not not adding more. Now, obviously, I know you wouldn't comment comment on someone's sort of uh financial advice, but what would you say to someone who um is maybe sort of thinking along the lines of yeah, it's done like they've already made it kind of thing.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:20:50) Yeah, I think everyone needs to when you invest in anything, you need to look at what you're investing in and and understand the business. You know, there's enough sort of examples of companies that have followed similar strategies globally. You know, there's even a very good example of a company that one of our directors is a director of MetaPlanet. You know, that that's done something like 300x um I believe um over a 12-month period. So, you know, I think my comment, you know, of we're only just getting started is it's quite balanced really, you know, in terms of, you know, is 40 a smaller number than 300, you know, of course it is, you know. So, I think people need to understand what we're doing, you know. Not it's it's it's it's not my um my my my job to sort of convince people that don't believe in what we're doing. You know, that's that's people's own choices. You know, if people have got questions, then of course, as as as hopefully everyone will know, I'm more than happy to answer them. I believe in what we're doing and I I believe in you know, our business strategy and and you know, if it sort of all sort of ended here, so to speak, I think that would be you know, a failure. um you know you know we are only just getting started and then to sort of wrap up you know Q4 last year was when this kind of got kicked off and I I know there's more backstory to that but that's kind of when wheels started turning and then you know the IPO launch we've had a a fantastic first month trading now you're in Vegas and hopefully you know I know you can't tell me but hopefully you're doing deals what do you think the the rest of the year looks like from a sort of uh direction perspect perspective for you and and and what you're going to do.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:22:15) Well, I hope that what everyone will see is that we stick to our strategy. We keep executing well. I think we've executed well to date. I I would like to say that we'll keep on accelerating, but you know, the the line's almost vertical now. So, maybe it's just maintaining that pace. Okay. I think that would be good enough for most reasonable people. Yeah. Let's just let's just keep going and and and and see how sort of quickly we can do everything with the appropriate responsibility, you know. Yeah. I I've got no idea like how big the company will be, you know, in in in even six months, you know, we've done well so far. As long as we can keep doing well, then, you know, we'll just see see where it goes, you know. Um it's pretty exciting, though.

**Interviewer:**
(0:22:50) Yeah, for sure. I don't think I've ever sort of witnessed almost firsthand, you know, being in Vegas with you work ethic like it. So, you know, I'm I'm very grateful that it's you at the helm and and probably not me to be honest.

**Andrew Webley:**
