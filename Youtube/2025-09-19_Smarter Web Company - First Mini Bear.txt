**Peter Dwan:**
(0:00:00) Hello everyone um and welcome back to the Bull Standard. My name is Peter Dwan. I also go by the Twitter handle BTC Bull Rider and today I have the two gentlemen leading Smarter Web Company, UK's number one Bitcoin treasury company. Before I introduce those two, uh just some housekeeping notes. Um, please if you have any questions, uh, type them in the Q&A, uh, in the chat so that at the end we can hopefully address some of the questions. And without further ado, um, yeah, welcome Andrew and Jesse.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:00:32) Thanks, Peter. Good to see you again. And, uh, we were just talking that it's going to be awesome that we're going to meet in person uh, 48 hours time.

**Peter Dwan:**
(0:00:38) That's right. That's right. Yes. Uh for those who are on the live stream, we would love to meet you in person at the unconference event in New York hosted by Tim and uh Sailor will be the headliner. So would love to meet as many of you guys as possible. Now why don't we jump—

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:00:57) Oh, sorry. I think it's the start of uh Bitcoin taking over Wall Street. You know, there there hasn't been conferences haven't been Bitcoin conferences in New York now there. Now I think it's the beginning of us uh making our presence known in Manhattan.

**Peter Dwan:**
(0:01:09) Yes. Exactly. Exactly. Um it's going to be very exciting and the first of many. Um so want to be respectful of everybody's time including those who are attending the live uh spaces. So why don't we just jump in. Uh it's been roughly about a month since we last spoke and obviously the price action hasn't been great but that is no reflection of uh how much activity you guys have been doing in the background. So one of the most important is the fact that you brought on a new CFO and other personnel. Um, Andrew, why don't you start off by kind of giving us an update uh on the personnel side?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:01:46) Yeah, so we we announced um two weeks ago, two weeks ago today that Albert had joined us as CFO. Albert's got a incredible um career um pre-joining us. Hopefully incredible career post joining us as well. Um, the important thing about Albert though is that he's a decent hardworking person who's got Footsie 250 experience in a CFO role. Um, so with our ambitions of where we're heading, that's really really important. Um, I'd also like to mention Mario who was doing the CFO job before. You know, he stayed in the company. It was his decision to a degree um that we recruited an experienced CFO who could take us on, you know, that that next leg up. Um and I think that's an incredible testament to what Mario's like as a as a person and the way that he's put the Smarter Web Company first.

(0:02:42) On top of that, we've also had two other people join. So on the same day as Albert, Lily joined as a marketing manager, she's working on both the operating business and the PLC. Um she's already helping us massively. Um, and then a week later we had Laura join as my um, still struggling to say this because you know it's sort of sounds a bit sort of above yourself but as my executive assistant um, but joking apart she's an absolute lifesaver because I get a lot of emails. I have to see a lot of people uh, and even that alone is is quite difficult to manage. But then she's also helping with some of our processes with some of the other people in the team um, and all that sort of stuff. So, you know, that's quite a lot for a company to have another three new people in quite a short space of time, but it's because of the the path that we're on, which is trying to make the company into one of the biggest companies in the UK.

**Peter Dwan:**
(0:03:32) I love that. Um, so just jump in real quick. Uh it ultimately the goal is to get into the Footsie 100 which um according to the Financial Times article that I read probably will require for you guys to be in the four, five, six billion dollar range. Um so why don't you talk a little bit about the difference between where you guys are now and and there and what are kind of the necessary steps to ultimately be included in the Footsie 100.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:04:04) Sure. I'd probably take that one. Um, so in the UK, you've got two stock exchanges. You've got the London Stock Exchange and you've got the Aquis exchange. Um, we're on the Aquis exchange. We're by far the biggest company on the Aquis exchange at the moment. By far the most liquid company. Um, if you add those two exchanges together, um, we would probably be, um, I don't know, somewhere between 100 and 200 in terms of liquidity. Um, so it's pretty good, but it's obviously not the top yet.

(0:04:41) Um, if you looked at us by market cap right now, um, we're we're a little bit away from being in the Footsie 250 if we were on the LSE. Um, so um, what you've got in the UK is you've got the Footsie 100 and then after that you've got the Footsie 250 and if you add the two of them together, you've got the Footsie 350 basically. So it's 350 biggest companies by market cap. Now, um, you know, without stating the obvious, you can't be in the Footsie 100 or the Footsie 250 if A, you're not on the London Stock Exchange, and B, you don't have a suitable market cap. Um, unlike say the S&P in the States, um, the um the the the the London indices don't have that requirement where there's any subjective, you know, requirements put in. It literally is: is your market cap and your 20 days liquidity enough? And then providing it's, you know, at the right point, you're in. Um, so, you know, we probably don't want to talk about it too much more than that other than the facts of what it takes to be in the Footsie 100 or the Footsie 250. Um, and the reality of, you know, where we are this very second. Sure. Um, and, um, that's probably a fair summary, isn't it, Jesse?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:06:02) Yeah, it does create a sort of interesting possibility that you know we so obviously Strategy has run into the realities that S&P 500 inclusion is based on committee and based on opinions uh whereas in the UK it is based on rules and so it's quite possible that that that Smarter Web could end up uh on the Footsie 250 or even the Footsie 100 before Strategy ends up on the S&P 500. Interesting. Depending on how things play out for both companies and and how uh how entrenched those opinions are on that S&P 500 committee in particular.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:06:39) Got it. My my gut feeling, not that you asked for it, is that we get in the Footsie 250. Um and I love Strategy, of course. I've got shares in Strategy, bought some more today. Um we get in the Footsie 250 before they get in the S&P, but they get in the S&P before we get in the Footsie 100. And I reckon that they'll be um in the um S&P in the not too distant future. That's that's my my my opinion.

**Peter Dwan:**
(0:07:06) Got it. Got it. Um Jesse, I want to pivot to you and again for those who are not familiar with uh Andrew and Jesse. Andrew is the CEO of Smarter Web Company and Jesse is the head of Bitcoin strategy. So Jesse uh as you know we are currently experiencing a mini bare market uh in you know the MNAV compression of Bitcoin treasury companies. I really think that it is in the bare where you get to really separate the the winners and losers in each cycle. Um and as you said uh there's a winner takes most mentality in this space. So what have you learned from the Bitcoin strategy side during this mini bear?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:07:43) Yeah, it's been, you know, you teed it up perfectly there because I think what's been most interesting, you know, I think that the the market has to find a way to test the strength of various companies. Um, the Bitcoin treasury company narrative was extremely hot in Q2 and it made it easy for anybody to raise money. Um, you know, announce they were going to become a Bitcoin treasury company. In the UK, that meant that there were like 25 different companies that popped up right after Andrew pioneered this model in the UK. Uh, and they all purported to, you know, be, oh, we're we're going to be the next Bitcoin treasury company. We're going to we're going to race to compete with Smarter Web.

(0:08:32) Um, and over the last few months, the tide has gone out, right? Um most I think still most of those 25 quote unquote Bitcoin treasury companies in in the UK uh still don't own any Bitcoin. Uh and and I think that's a you know it shows you how you can have the intention to raise a bunch of money and and try to you know pivot your strategy to be focused on delivering Bitcoin yield for shareholders. But uh a lot of things can stop that along the way and uh execution's hard. Um and so I think that the tide going out really exacerbates that uh phenomenon and shows the market um which companies have what it takes in terms of infrastructure, leadership um and shareholder backing, shareholder support to continue on that path and and whose flywheels will stop or have stopped.

(0:09:28) Mhm. Um, and you know, in the UK, we have a slide in our investor deck, um, that I that I made two months ago that showed Smarter Web and the two two closest competitors in the UK in terms of market cap. Um, you know, and when I first made this in early July, Smarter Web was was a, you know, 700 million pound market cap company. Um, and the two closest competitors were like like a hundred million and 80 million uh pounds. Um, and now fast forward two months and Smarter Web is is about half the the market cap that it was. So, it's hurt, right? But the other companies are are like, you know, a fifth uh or or a tenth the market cap that they were.

(0:10:18) And and you know that I think that's the reality of what has happened um in terms of the where we are at in this sort of mini cycle for Bitcoin treasury companies is when the tide goes out for for for a strategy that amounts to you know Bitcoin volatility squared that can hurt a lot um if you're not positioned in a in a company that has what it takes to survive that and then and then um you know ride the next wave up. Uh and I think that what has happened in the UK um and probably globally too is that this cycle has been a test of the strength of Bitcoin treasury companies and has shown on a relative basis who is um who is still in good shape and positioned to you know to benefit the most from the return of sentiment.

(0:11:16) Uh, and I think it's quite clear that at this point in time, Smarter Web, it feels like to me, is in a in a great position of strength on a relative basis in particular to other Bitcoin small Bitcoin treasury companies that have popped up in in the last six months. Um, and it puts us in a I think a great position to take that next leg up um and follow the kind of MetPlanet journey that we've seen uh over the last year and a half from MetaPlanet. And and I think that would mean for us, you know, kind of evolving from the 2500ish Bitcoin that we're at to, you know, maybe quite a bit higher than that um over the the next six months.

**Peter Dwan:**
(0:11:54) I love that. Uh and I think it's either Warren Buffett or his right-hand man, Charlie who used to say that uh it's when the tide goes out, you can see who's been swimming naked. And so we have been observing that um yeah uh in the space quite a bit. Uh I do also want to note that despite the fact that there has been severe MNAV compression that you guys have been consistent in still uh building out that Bitcoin stack which I really commend you. And another thing that has really separated you guys from other Bitcoin treasury companies is that I think out of all the Bitcoin treasury companies um you guys excel the most in communicating with us the community. And as a result, we are continuously going to believe uh in Smarter Web by giving you guys the capital to keep you guys above one MNAV so that despite this MNAV compression, you guys are still being able to play this accretive dilution game. So kudos to you guys.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:12:54) Um I want to—I have another point on on that. I you know I think I think if we're being like tough and fair about what what is happening with the sort of bare market for Bitcoin treasury companies is um you know what is an MNAV above 1x? It's it's collective investor belief that uh the company will be able to deliver Bitcoin yield into the future and and that's discounted back into the present and that's everybody's you know individual assumptions all collated together into one you know market consensus um and and I think the reality of it is that you deserve an MNAV above 1x if you have a track record of delivering Bitcoin yield.

(0:13:37) And that is not true for most purported quote unquote Bitcoin treasury companies who pop up and and and don't deliver that. And that's the reality of like there's a big filter of, you know, companies that intend to run the strategy and then companies that succeed in running the strategy and have a track record of doing so. Um, and and I think that's the the cold reality of where we're at right now is a lot of quote unquote Bitcoin treasury companies don't deserve an MNAV above 1x because they haven't had a track record of delivering Bitcoin yield. Um, and I think that's where Smarter Web does set itself apart from, you know, the other small Bitcoin treasury companies because we have quite a strong track record of not only delivering that Bitcoin yield, but being very transparent and communicating frequently and and I think that shows up in investor confidence that we have what it takes to continue delivering that yield. And that justifies the MNAV above 1x.

(0:14:31) I think it's the the most important thing in a Bitcoin treasury company is putting together those pieces such that investors have confidence that there will be yield into the future because that's how you succeed and I think you know we're doing that and some others are not.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:14:48) I could add something to that as well actually which is quite interesting and you know it's something that I think about a lot but maybe some investors don't realize the importance of it either and that follows on from what you guys are saying and that's there's there's two other variables that everyone needs to factor in when they're looking at a Bitcoin treasury company. So my favorite variable um is liquidity um you know and the reason why that's my favorite variable is because that allows a Bitcoin treasury company to have an ATM style facility.

(0:15:18) So if you look at us, we're incredibly liquid and that's great. It's great for when you're raising new institutional capital because they need a certain liquidity to invest a certain amount of money. Um but it's also great because then you can run an ATM. Now what goes hand in hand with liquidity is the community. Um, so you know we all look at MNAV, cover all the different things that you know we've got on our website and a lot of things that we don't have on our website which we will build into our website in time. Um, but the community is is is is so valuable to a Bitcoin treasury company.

(0:15:52) You know, we we often say when we're talking about Bitcoin treasury company valuations is that, you know, they're probably the most undervalued equity story in the world ever. Um, now if you use that same sort of analogy, you can say that the community is probably the most undervalued, not in my mind, but I don't hear it being talked about in terms of importance enough. Um, so that's probably the most undervalued metric that people don't factor in um to Bitcoin treasury company valuations because it's it's so important.

(0:16:30) Um because you know what what what Jesse is saying about the the MNAV and the premium you know in most cases um or or certainly for the good ones anyway which obviously fluctuates you know um as you know different stages in the cycle play out but that that premium is proof of work at the end of the day um and and that's what people need to remember and and the community are the people that say and this is how it should be. They say to the management, "We value what you're doing or we don't value what you're doing um because of your actions." So, I'd like to just remind everyone that, you know, when you're looking at a Bitcoin treasury company, particularly a smaller one, I wouldn't bother with something like Strategy. Look at liquidity. Um and then for every Bitcoin treasury company, look at the community and look at sentiment in the community. Um that's worth remembering if if I can make that point, please.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:17:21) Yeah. And and Peter actually feels strongly about this too. So Peter, I'm going to turn it on you and say like what what are we missing that you would like to add about, you know, community as a metric?

**Peter Dwan:**
(0:17:32) Uh you're not missing anything. Uh that's why I actually got bullish on you guys. And so the way I see it is um for uh any company, especially a Bitcoin treasury company, there's three types of leverage. There's financial leverage, right? There's technological leverage and then there's social leverage. Okay? Community is effectively technological leverage and social leverage. Okay? So if Bitcoin companies are trying to generate Bitcoin yield through Bitcoin to work, then your community and social media presence is uh what I would call your cultural torque.

(0:18:10) Um and this is especially important is because uh you know I worked in traditional finance for 14 years. I know how they think. 90—I would be very generous when I say that 95% of Wall Street doesn't understand Bitcoin and I would say 99.99% of Wall Street does not understand Bitcoin treasury companies and so because of that Andrew you made a great point that you—if you are a new Bitcoin treasury company right and I I I would obviously exclude uh MSTR because now they've moved over to the institutional side and I would say MetaPlanet is pretty much there right now as well. So outside of those two, if you are a new Bitcoin treasury company, you better bend over backwards to try to woo uh the community members. And that's where you guys are head and shoulders above um everyone else and even against MSTR and even MetaPlanet in my opinion on how communicative you've been uh with the community. So kudos to you guys.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:19:13) Thank you. Yeah, thank you Peter. Um yeah, we you know we think that you know you and I have talked about this a little bit Peter that that in my view community it's funny because community is a very secondary metric and you know and it's even um I've been on a podcast where you know it was the whole point of of the podcast was reasons why Bitcoin treasury companies seem like a scam and you know pointing to community feels like one of those things from from the altcoin days where you know like that that was the only thing you really could stand on and and so people would try to point at their community as as a as a good sign.

(0:19:48) But the reality of it is like a community is downstream of all the other things that we're doing. And so all of those inputs of of what Smarter Web is bringing to the table show up in terms of uh attracting interest and investment and then active engagement from retail investors who are plugged into Twitter and getting all their information there. And so it's it's it's very secondary. Um, but it's a great summary of everything that that other, you know, Twitter savvy investors are seeing and their pattern recognition is amounting to: Smarter Web looks like it's got a great combination of things. Uh, and I think that's very telling uh, and instructive for for investors as they're doing their homework.

**Peter Dwan:**
(0:20:33) Correct. And also uh one other thing that I don't hear many people talking about is the importance of the depth of the of the capital markets that the Bitcoin treasury company is in. Right? So obviously UK is while not as big as say for instance America is still a significant capital market as opposed to like some small like you know Southeast Asia countries or Latin America companies. So that you know is effectively your runway uh to drive institutional capital as well.

(0:21:02) And that's actually something that I want to slightly pivot to is that one of the reasons why you know a MetaPlanet of the world or a Smarter Web Company of the world is interesting to the locals um of of your country is the fact that the current crypto laws has been very onerous uh and there's just not enough access to say Bitcoin. Right? So, uh, I just saw a couple days ago that Japan is, uh, trying to change the crypto laws from currently, uh, 55% to reduce it to a flat 20% by the end of 2026. I wanted to see, you know, is there something similar to that in the UK? And if so, is that a net positive or a net negative for Smarter Web Company?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:21:49) So when we speak to um investors um we always try and explain the concept of Bitcoin yield or what I often like to call compound Bitcoin um because that's how I explain compound interest to my kids you know um so compound Bitcoin is a really simple concept which we all call you know Bitcoin yield um so in the UK historically for about five six years something like that you know Bitcoin has been very difficult to buy. Uh the banks, most of them quite unfriendly. Um you know, and and it's it's made it hard.

(0:22:26) Um so you've had a lot of capital um in what we call ISAs and SIPPs, which is like a retirement account and a non-retirement account. Broadly speaking the same thing slightly different tax treatments um where you know people have had this money and they haven't been able to invest in anything other than Strategy and you know in in in later days more other things um but that's changing and that's really positive.

(0:22:50) Um so in the UK they're announcing ETNs uh which is like a poor cousin to the ETF basically um and and I think that'll be October that they come out and one of our uh network uh told me that we had a hand to play in these rules getting loosened or changed or whatever you want to say. Um and and that's cool if true. Um but regardless of that, it's cool anyway. It's not going as far as they should go and as I say, they should have done ETFs, but you know, it's a step forward, which you know, that's all you can hope from the the UK uh authorities at the moment, you know.

(0:23:29) Um so so that's positive. And if you look at what happened in America um with the ETFs, fantastic. More importantly for us though, what that sends out is a clear message to the UK that Bitcoin isn't something that you're not allowed to get involved with. So it's acceptance. So I talk to a lot of people at the moment about, you know, Bitcoin in all different angles, but a lot of the time it's it's literally about, you know, is it okay, etc., etc. And to me, this is like a rubber stamp that's being smashed on top of Bitcoin by the FCA, you know, our regulator who do a pretty good job actually a lot of the time. Um, and they're they're saying it's okay everyone.

(0:24:17) And then what that does is that then cascades out to the institutional investors who can buy Bitcoin right now, i.e. an ETF if they want to. But what we're trying to get everyone to understand is the concept of compound Bitcoin, which is where whatever happens and as accepted as Bitcoin gets in the whole country hopefully at all levels, you still can't get compound Bitcoin without a Bitcoin treasury company.

(0:24:47) So, you know, it's a pretty exciting time for us all because you you you don't get the institutional investors now saying, "Oh, yeah, but you know, the FCA didn't like that." and all this sort of stuff, you know, that that's gone. That argument, you know, so so it's it's pretty exciting, you know, as somebody that lives in the UK, you know, clearly I'd wish that they did more quicker. Maybe they didn't do some of the things they did in the past, but you know, as long as you get progress, then, you know, I think you have to be quite happy with that.

**Peter Dwan:**
(0:25:11) Sure. Let me ask you a little further question. Um so I I presume you guys are talking to financial institutions to you know raise capital at Smarter Web. Uh but as you said you know right now because of the lack of an ETN or Bitcoin ETF. Yeah. It it's not the the rubber stamp is not quite there yet. So my question then is what are the institutions that you are talking to? Are they coming to you and like how are you proactively identifying which institutions to talk to so that you don't waste your time um and hopefully create a long-term financial partner the same way that MetaPlanet has uh with Evo Fund?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:25:55) Yes. So, you know, these conversations happen all the time. Um and sometimes they're people that come to us and sometimes it's where we go to them. Where we go to them, it's almost always through our broker. Um you know who do a very good job. Sometimes the inbound stuff comes to them and then they come to us or or or just direct through our website. You know, one of the largest possible investors that I'm hoping become an investor soon. They came to us through our website. You know, they filled out the contact form just like anyone else. Um it's pretty cool actually.

(0:26:33) Um and um so yeah, that's how the conversations happen. You know, clearly we're interested in speaking to all the time. The challenge that Jesse and I have is that, you know, time is really precious now. Um, you know, there's so much to do. We both work very, very long days and we both love it. Um, however, um, you know, time is time is a precious commodity. Um, so you know, we're quite good at asking the questions and our broker are very good at asking the questions of making sure that when we go and see someone in person or when we go and see them via Teams or whatever, um, that, you know, it it's it's a a valid thing.

(0:27:08) You know, as people that have watched me talk um, before, you know, I do go on a little bit. So like yesterday afternoon on Sunday afternoon, I had a discussion that was booked in for half an hour. It went on for an hour and a half. Um so you know time is difficult. Um but the thing that stood out to me quite a lot is that when we started this you know less than five months ago um there was a lot of skepticism out there um with the model. Now there's a lot of enthusiasm but for balance there is also a period of time at the moment going back to what Jesse was talking about with the MNAV compression the volatility whatever is going to happen in the very very short term in the market.

(0:27:51) Um, and I think there's a lot of institutional investors that are waiting to get involved. Um, and they're not waiting. Well, some of them will wait for a specific thing that I can't talk about, but a lot of them are waiting just to give it a little bit of time. And I know that's very difficult for people to hear that. Um, and that's why it's so fantastic that we've got an ATM style facility that runs on every up day, you know, because when we're waiting for some of these pretty awesome checks potentially to arrive, you know, we can still make progress that, you know, is not as good as we hope and as we want, but that's the way it goes.

(0:28:25) Sometimes you'll get some months where they'll be quiet, some months where they'll be absolutely crazy. So, we've got the luxury that I believe I'm correct in saying that no other company in the UK's got um Bitcoin treasury company or company masquerading as a Bitcoin treasury company in the sense that we can generate that capital as we're trying to secure the right capital.

(0:28:52) And you know the final point before I give someone else a chance to speak is that we've been offered a lot of money um in the last couple of weeks you know call it the last month but it's not the right money. Um, and that might be because of the price, it might be because of the structure, it might be because of what we believe their intentions are. And we won't do it. We don't need to do it. We've got a really good, strong company that's growing. Not as quickly as we'd like it to grow at the moment, but still probably one of the quickest in the world. Um, but, you know, obviously we always want more. Um, you know, that's how we've driven it to this point that we've got to to now. But we have to be really careful and Jesse and I talk about this all day every day about the right capital at the right time. Um and I think that's what's going to give that long-term beneficial Bitcoin yield effect um you know to our shareholders.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:29:43) So, um, yeah, there's quite a bit to it and and apologies for going on a bit. To just add a little color to to that for because some people have wondered like what is what does that mean that it's not the right capital and you know like just to to provide a little peek behind the curtain for folks like you know maybe that's they're asking for a 20% discount and then and then you're saying well like that's not fair first of all but then second of all like why are they asking for that? Like do they just want to do that deal and then hedge out their exposure and then collect that that benefit which would amount to them like finding a way to short the stock, you know, like those are the questions you start to ask.

(0:30:21) And you know then other people want other structures where you know they they want a ridiculously sweet um cherry on top and it's like well that's not you know you're not aligned and also that would give away like you know x% of the company a year from now and that's you know for free um you know on top of what's already a fair deal and then you know you have to say no to that too.

(0:30:48) So, you know, those those things play in here. And and to Andrew's other point there of um you know, I think that uh investors on Twitter um are sometimes surprised to find out that institutions are impacted by market sentiment. And so I think, you know, a lot of the conversations we're having now is people who are interested, paying a lot of attention to the space, also seeing who's, you know, been swimming naked and, you know, their short list of who they're interested in is growing shorter, which is great for Smarter Web, frankly.

(0:31:22) Um, and but they're waiting, right? They're waiting for some sort of swing in the pendulum in the other direction. They don't care about nailing the bottom. They're not trying to catch a falling knife, but they want to find a good entry point and that, you know, on an institutional scale means missing the bottom, and they're perfectly comfortable with that.

(0:31:44) So, you know, that's another bit of like sort of context is I think that's what we're seeing behind the scenes here of institutional investors are sniffing around, getting ready, and waiting. Um and and and frankly that means it's it's going to be led as it has always been in Bitcoin treasury companies. It will be led by savvy retail investors who set the bottom. And and I think that's realistically I think that's probably where hopefully where we're at with our MNAV now at 1.6 as of today. I just checked. Um and and I think that that's in my opinion reaching a place of uh of ridiculous value in terms of what our track record says and you know if you assume any sort of continuation of that performance in terms of Bitcoin yield.

(0:32:31) Um so in that sense it it will be retail investors who who buy the bottom and set the bottom. Uh and then and then you know once momentum starts going in the other direction again this is part of how it goes really fast in the other direction and momentum stacks um you know and it's rather reflexive in this industry. Um so a little bit behind the behind the curtain in terms of institutional conversations there.

**Peter Dwan:**
(0:32:56) I I want to double tap into that because um as you alluded to, you're saying that institutions do not necessarily need to wait for the absolute pico bottom to raise. Um so then are you guys actively trying to time the institutional raise on the upswing so that it is not nearly as dilutive for the shareholders yet they're still capturing some upside?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:33:21) Yeah, I think you know our view there is that it's it's very accretive right now. Um and and that's you know the advantage of having a strong track record of delivering Bitcoin yield is we're still at 1.6. It's still quite attractive. I I think Strategy would be very happy to to issue equity at a 1.6 MNAV. Um I think the you know so it's not that we're trying to time anything to to to you know make it more accretive at a little higher of MNAV.

(0:33:47) I think that's just kind of the reality of of psychology in in institutional allocators is they're they're going to end up buying a little higher um realistically speaking because they first of all want to you know the this is kind of unprecedented for for a lot of um these allocators watching an industry emerge so quickly and you know things move really fast in Bitcoin treasury companies and they want to make sure that the dust settles you know they—nobody nobody wants to stake their job at an institutional allocator on uh catching a falling knife, right? Like you you want to wait for some the dust to settle and then you're happy to to buy a little bit higher. That's that's me interpreting what I'm seeing. Um but I think it makes sense in terms of how they're behaving.

**Peter Dwan:**
(0:34:37) What is your guys's general sentiment on these PIPE deals? Because I don't want to name any particular companies, but they've been quite from my perspective brutal um to experience.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:34:57) I'll I'll I'll start it off there and say that we've always had the view that the best and and only way to to go about uh things for Smarter Web, the winning formula for Smarter Web um is to follow the kind of MetaPlanet story of starting small, delivering small, growing that, delivering more uh and and and building organically uh you know and building that investor base predominantly retail investors who are supportive and see the math and see the vision.

(0:35:24) Um, and this is an organic growth story. It's a path dependent story of you can't become a large MetaPlanet style Bitcoin treasury company without starting small and building a track record of of execution that you can point to to help justify a premium because you have a track record of delivering. Um, and for us it's always been clear that that's the winning model for, you know, for a company in in Smarter Web's shoes.

(0:35:50) And so we've been focused on that. And you know there's been innovation in how do you go about it in other ways which which to me has always kind of looked like shortcuts that uh don't help you keep get the flywheel going and keep the flywheel going because if you shortcut to scale there's not a track record of delivering which justifies a premium and and that's that's the whole strategy here is is to have that track record in place.

**Peter Dwan:**
(0:36:16) So I want to hear you guys' opinions on MNAV. So, I'll I'll show you my opinion uh right after I ask you guys, but do you believe if you're Bitcoin treasury company and you're below one MNAV that that is an opportunity or is that a death trap?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:36:41) Well, I think you have to refer back to your previous question, Peter. Um so if you look at um you know markets just in general terms doesn't have to be Bitcoin treasury companies or even Bitcoin um you know for a market if you put a lot more supply into the market then the price is is going to get depressed right um because the only way that that is going to work without the price getting smashed um is if you've got you know growing growing demand.

(0:37:11) Um so I think then if you look at um MNAV as an example you need to think about it in the same context of that. So if something is trading at say let's say 0.75 MNAV um then there's an opportunity there in a way um but there's also a big risk and the big risk there is you know like say for example we acquired somebody that was trading at 0.75. Um, yes, we're buying something cheaper. You know, we're buying Bitcoin for 75p instead of a pound. Yeah. Um, so that's great, but you're also taking something into your shareholder base if you did it with paper, i.e. an all share offer. Um, and that might not be so smart dependent on the shareholder base that you're acquiring, their motivations, etc., etc.

(0:38:06) Um, so it's not quite as clear cut as everyone thinks, you know, if something's trading below a 1 MNAV, whether or not it becomes a a viable deal. Because if you go back to what we were saying also about the community, um, and how fantastic our shareholder base is, um, including our community, you know, we've got a real asset there in the sense that, you know, that they're incredibly supportive, they're incredibly distributed. Um it's not like we've got, you know, sort of a consolidated—Well, we do have there's some consolidation. I've got quite a large shareholding, but you know, I'm holding it for a long time or certainly the vast majority of it for a very long time.

(0:38:50) Um and but we haven't got like big shareholders that may exit out of it. And uh like we were talking earlier, the investors that will write sizable checks, they're ones that we believe will be holding it for many, many years. So, I think when you go back to the MNAV and you look at MNAV below one, you have to think to yourself, well, yes, we could buy something here. Um, but you know, is it the right thing to buy? And I think the way that you do that is you look at the impact and you obviously you can't 100% predict it but you can make an educated you know summary of of what that impact is going to be on then the supply of your shares.

(0:39:29) Because the other thing that we've talked about is the ATM facility and how fantastic it is. Um and you know if you do something that then impacts on your share price then that ATM becomes less um beneficial in terms of Bitcoin yield than it would otherwise be. So whilst I'm incredibly impatient um and I'm looking to grow the company as quickly as possible and I I think we'll actually do it relatively speaking as as I want to do it in terms of the time scales um to get to where I want us to be. um you you do have to make those moves at the right time because you know the you know it's a bit like um actually this is quite a good analogy actually. I've never used this one.

(0:40:08) So so when you were kids did you ever get told the story of the hare and the tortoise? Yes. Yeah. So maybe some Bitcoin treasury companies have done that. They came out the gate very fast and then they fell asleep. Um so joking apart it is about making the right moves at the right time. This is, as Jesse says, this a lot better than me. It's about consistency. Every single day, trying your best to deliver the mission, you know, not, you know, I'll have a great day one day and then I'll do nothing for two weeks, you know, that just doesn't cut it to me.

(0:40:40) Um, so, so yeah, I that's my view on MNAV. It's not it's not a clear cut. If you can buy, you know, a company at 0.X MNAV after fees because it costs fees to acquire it, whether that's a good thing or not, it it you got to think about the other aspects of that transaction.

**Peter Dwan:**
(0:40:56) Got it. Yeah. The way I think about it is interesting. If there is a company that in the bare market is below one MNAV, um, for the majority of them, it's actually better for their shareholders to actually just sell the Bitcoin, right? Because they don't have a massive enough stack that will move the Bitcoin capital markets like obviously if you're MSTR that would do it right and then I also ran the analysis in Grok where it's like all right if you do an all cash deal a hybrid cash and stock deal or all stock deal all stock deal especially if you're the acquiring company and you have above one MNAV it's extremely accretive.

(0:41:38) However Uh I didn't think about the one aspect that you brought Andrew which is very interesting is not only are you acquiring the Bitcoin but you're also hopefully acquiring the investor base as well and that is a qualitative part that cannot be modeled out but rather it's more of a feel. So that's a very interesting concept. Um and obviously we'll have to wait uh in an unfortunately inevitable bear to see how that plays out. But I want to talk about specifically Smarter Web during the bare market. Is your guys's objective to, you know, have to be above 1 MNAV at all times in order to play this accretive dilution game? I know it's not something that you can fully control, but is that how you guys are thinking about it during the bare market?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:42:28) Um, no. I you know I first of all we're aware that the market will give us what we have to then work with um at any given time and you know Strategy in 2022 I think maybe 2021 2022 I think was under 1x MNAV. That's the the strongest Bitcoin treasury company in the world and they were under 1x um so maybe it'll happen right for everybody.

(0:42:55) Um I think there's different things you can do at different times. Um in you know kind of to your original question I I think in a funny way the lower you get under 1x MNAV the clearer you uh opportunity you have with particular levers um which could be interesting like for example and and and again we haven't had to think about this a lot so you know we haven't fully explored all these strategies but you know we're vaguely aware of and collecting you know options that we would we would dig into more to figure out what was right for our company in those certain conditions.

(0:43:32) But, you know, one possible thing that I I think could be interesting is, you know, if you're if you're at like a 0.7 or something quite low, um, you know, could you do a Bitcoin denominated convertible note to raise dollars to then buy your own stock? Uh which would be you know effectively buying Bitcoin at a at a discount using uh you know an an obligation in the future that also is is a mitigated downside risk because it's Bitcoin denominated like you know so so that's an example of how you know you might approach that scenario.

(0:44:04) The 1x if you're actually stuck at 1x it's in in some ways possibly trickier. That's where though convertible notes at a premium you know and you could shift the terms of a convertible note to focus more on the premium, make, you know, make it more attractive to the investor in certain ways so that you can make the conversion premium higher. And if you issue, you know, let's let's say it's at a 25% conversion premium, but you're at a 1x MNAV, well, you're effectively at a 1.25 MNAV for that transaction. And that's a way where you can get the flywheel going and and you know, and then that starts to justify being, you know, above 1x MNAV again.

(0:44:50) And then of course there's there's always the option you know the the BATNA here. The thing where you don't have to do anything. Um that's your your worst case scenario is keep looking for something that's better than doing nothing. And you know we can always do that in a scenario where our MNAV gets too low and wait for conditions to change. That's essentially what Strategy did in in 2022 and it it worked out just fine for them. They were um you know they had 200,000 Bitcoin and they were at an under 1x MNAV and then you know year or two later they were at a 4x MNAV. So you know sometimes this just takes the the tide turning.

**Peter Dwan:**
(0:45:22) Yeah, that's interesting. And and the reason why I bring up the bear conversation so much is I actually believe at least from my selfish perspective that if you're a Bitcoin strategy company who openly communicates that you have a bare market strategy that that will then uh stay in the mindset of the retail investor base that inevitably when a bear comes that we want to put capital with you guys as opposed to someone who doesn't have a bare market strategy.

(0:45:56) Um, my question then is how do you guys think about—I think you briefly mentioned it. Are you in the uh Saylor camp of never sell your Bitcoin and therefore you uh do as you mentioned the the convertible bonds so that you can do share buybacks like how how do you guys think about never sell your Bitcoin?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:46:26) Yeah, certainly not something that I'd be ever supportive of doing. Um, you know, I'd never say never because sometimes things happen and you know, you know, you've got to make decisions at the time, but you know, I it would be very very hard for me um to have any support for a strategy that involved selling the Bitcoin. So, you know, the one that everyone talks about is selling the Bitcoin to buy the stock back. You know, I just don't think in the UK buybacks typically work very well.

(0:46:56) Um, you know, it's not like in the States where, you know, buybacks have, you know, from the big tech companies especially have, uh, been, you know, pretty incredible actually in terms of pushing the share prices higher. It's not like that in the UK. And like I would prefer to have a few more shares in issue and to have the Bitcoin intact. I I wouldn't wouldn't do it. So, I wouldn't I wouldn't say never. Um, but it's certainly not something that I'd be supportive of at all of of doing.

(0:47:26) I suspect with some of the companies that are failing, I suspect you will see exactly that, but people shouldn't worry about that. Um, because, you know, they own bugger all Bitcoin anyway. Um, so it's not like, you know, it's just like somebody with a bit of Bitcoin selling it into the market. Um, you know, the Bitcoin market can handle, you know, tens of thousands of Bitcoin, let alone, you know, 100 Bitcoin or something. Um, so I don't know. I'd be interested for Jesse to give his views, but that would be my summary.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:47:57) Yeah. Yeah. We we strongly view it that way. Um, our goal here is to accumulate Bitcoin and and put the company in a position of unique strength in the UK as having the largest Bitcoin balance sheet. Um, and and our view is that that is digital capital for the digital age and will make Smarter Web the best capitalized business in the UK. So that's that's where we're trying to get to and you know selling Bitcoin for any reason along the way hurts that objective.

(0:48:24) Um and that includes you know we we closely follow the ideas that the investor community are coming up with about strategies you can use you know in various scenarios. Recently there was talk about what you might do uh under a 1x MNAV. Um and and one of the main topics was like Bitcoin dividends, you know, because you're not a closed-ended entity. You can distribute Bitcoin dividends. There's precedent for it and that that could be a way to protect that, you know, the 1x MNAV. It's a credible threat that if you're going to distribute dividends, then you know why trade at 0.7 MNAV? You know, it should be 1x.

(0:49:11) Um, and that's in theory a fine idea. I think that the the conversation around that was missing how the second order effects of how that harms the business after you you you uh you know complete that kind of transaction. If you drain the the the treasury of Bitcoin, you set yourself back in terms of where you're trying to go. Uh you know this this strategy globally is about trying to become the MicroStrategy of your capital market right and that means being the best capitalized Bitcoin business uh and having you know the the best balance sheet for you the most creditworthy balance sheet for to offer you know preferred equity instruments and whatever other instruments allow you to continue um the Bitcoin yield strategy in in particular by tapping the fixed income market.

(0:50:06) So the goal here is not to, you know, drain the treasury. It's instead to retain that and then keep adding when when when it's attractive and constructive. Um, and so I think that that's probably the the piece that that I think was missing from that conversation is like, okay, that in the near term that can help, but does it harm the strategic objectives of the company? Are you better off sitting on your hands the way that Strategy did in 2022 and it worked out great for them to not you know distribute Bitcoin to try to protect that 1x MNAV when they went under it. Um so you know that I think that's the other piece that I would add.

**Peter Dwan:**
(0:50:40) Yeah I completely agree um and one other thing to add is Bitcoiners are very very logical analytical people but they uh from my observation um don't think that hard outside of hey does it pencil out and why that's important is because another thing is while technically speaking um issuing a Bitcoin uh dividend will be you know uh short-term accretive it's also not very feasible because it creates a lot of friction right like some accounts don't allow for it and it just adds a lot of complexity.

(0:51:13) Um so I asked you guys these bare market questions because I really wanted to see how you guys think about it. And just off the cuff, I think uh I came away very impressed with the fact that you guys are always keeping a pulse on the on the community and you're seeing all these various strategies that have been offered up and it sounds like you guys actually already thought about it. Um and you know, as a fundamental Bitcoiner uh myself, I love the fact of never sell your Bitcoin and so you guys have articulated that very well.

(0:51:50) Uh now uh I just want to for those who are still in the live spaces to open this up to questions. I don't see any questions in uh in there but just one last question um while we wait for potential you know questions in the chat is how do you guys think about Bitcoin purchases because inevitably while we may not have those very uh violent blowoff tops we may or may not within Bitcoin. Do you—are you guys also in the Saylor camp of I will always buy Bitcoin at the top or are you strategic with your Bitcoin purchases?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:52:28) No. So we we'll buy Bitcoin and everyone can see this from what we've done. We buy Bitcoin almost as quickly as we can. Um the only reason which everyone knows now for the first let's say six weeks where we spread it out for up to say two weeks is all part of the plan, all part of the strategy. Um because when you're tiny right at the start, what if you buy some Bitcoin and then you know and and you know that you want to raise some more money next week and the price moves against you? That's why we spread it out in the early days. No more complicated than that.

(0:53:03) What we do now is we try and buy Bitcoin as quickly as we can. Um you know and um funnily enough I haven't got around to talking about Jesse to to Jesse yet about this and this won't happen in the next week or two but at some point in the not too distant future I want to get to the stage where we can actually announce our ATM subscription proceeds every week rather than every two weeks because then everyone knows that there'll always be a purchase every single week.

(0:53:33) So, I don't think it'll be a million days. Um, I don't know to see how the market pans out, but maybe let's say 3 months. And then when Saylor's sticking his tweet out every Sunday, we'll be sticking our tweet out every Monday with our announcement every Tuesday. Um, because we do the subscription stuff every Monday. Um, and then all of the other things that we do around that, you know, the lumpier bits of capital will be, you know, bang bang bang whenever they come in. But then everyone always knows that there's that to follow.

(0:54:04) So um but but very directly with your question, you know, our job when the the cash settles from the trade and it depends how it all gets get gets done, how quickly that comes in, you know, we we get it in there as quickly as possible. And we don't look at the price when we're buying it, you know, we buy it regardless of the price. If it's up, down, nothing, makes no difference to us, you know. So, so yeah, we're not trying to time anything. We're just trying to manage the treasury as we've told everyone that we're doing, which is a Bitcoin treasury uh as the business grows.

**Peter Dwan:**
(0:54:34) Got it. Uh we do have a couple questions. This is from uh um I I I don't know if I'm mispronouncing Sasha. Uh he asked, "Hello, guys. How would you turn MetaPlanet investors into Smarter Web investors with which arguments?"

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:54:57) Yeah, I um first of all, I I I think that I think that the three most compelling companies in the world right now in in in my personal order here um are Smarter Web number one, MetaPlanet number two, and Strategy number three. Uh that that to say, I think that MetaPlanet's a fantastic business. And and personally, I I probably wouldn't be trimming from MetaPlanet um because I because of that, but instead I might be looking at elsewhere in my portfolio and saying, "What am I holding that's not as good as MetaPlanet?" And uh you know, and and what is where does Smarter Web possibly fit in?

(0:55:40) Um, I think uh, you know, in how I think about it is that a Bitcoin treasury company, a well-run Bitcoin treasury company, uh, exists in one of a few life cycle stages. Um, I think, you know, right off right off the bat, uh, you have to get to call it a thousand Bitcoin. Um, and and that's kind of stage zero, right? Like do you have what it takes? Can you get your infrastructure and machinery humming um to to get the flywheel turning to get enough investor support that you can accumulate a thousand Bitcoin?

(0:56:15) Um after that I think it's kind of a process of you know growth in particular through like an ATM style instrument as your base layer plus have the complement of lumpier larger sometimes institutional uh raises to complement that. So, you got your, you know, your low-level constant ATM style fundraising and your lumpy um equity issuance with often with institutions. Uh and and that's I think what it takes to get to kind of MetaPlanet, right? Um 20,000 Bitcoin, call it. Uh and then beyond that, you start to evolve into Strategy. Um you know, which is what we're seeing with MetaPlanet right now.

(0:57:00) But the important part is that uh when I think about, you know, what's what's the most attractive thing to invest in, it's something that's growing fast, right? And that's relative to how much Bitcoin you already have in particular and and the growth rate that you're able to to achieve based on that denominator, that base already. Um, and that puts Smarter Web in, in my opinion, in an extremely compelling place where we've gotten through the de-risking of getting to a thousand Bitcoin. We've proven that we have what it takes to run the strategy and deliver Bitcoin yield to investors. Um and and that's all running right. We have the ATM like instrument. Um and we have our our other lumpier um fundraises going on as well.

(0:57:52) Uh and that puts us, you know, MetaPlanet started the year with 2,000 Bitcoin. We're roughly at that level right now. Um, nine months later, MetaPlanet has 20,000 Bitcoin and they're about to buy 10,000 Bitcoin more. Um, and so, you know, that's what's possible in this life cycle stage that Smarter Web has now graduated into.

(0:58:15) And, and again, you know, we've talked about how most Bitcoin treasury companies in the UK in particular never actually bought any Bitcoin. They never got off the ground. They never made it through that first stage, that stage zero of proving yourself. Uh, Smarter Web has now proved itself and is now at a very exciting place. I think a de-risked kind of sweet spot, a Goldilocks zone where you're still small, but you've proven that you can, you know, you have what it takes to run the model.

(0:58:46) And we can now—we see the path in front of us to grow the way that MetaPlanet has running the same, you know, strategy that MetaPlanet put in place. We have the same tools running. Um, and it gives us quite a clear runway to get to that scale and then, you know, we'll we'll evolve into hopefully we'll be able to evolve into uh Strategy the way that MetaPlanet is now starting to do as they've graduated into the next as they're currently sort of transitioning into that that next stage for themselves.

(0:59:15) Um, but that's how I think about it and I think that you know the investor's job as Paul Tudor Jones put it is is to be on the fastest horse, right? And uh and that's about growth and growth rate relative to your starting point. Um and I think that's where we have an advantage and that's why I put us as the most compelling business in the world right now because we have de-risked, we've got a clear runway but we're still smaller than MetaPlanet and that gives us a lot more room for growth and you know hopefully delivering Bitcoin yield to shareholders.

**Peter Dwan:**
(0:59:50) Yeah, I just want to echo a point uh that Jesse made actually in our previous uh podcast which uh a light bulb moment for Jesse himself was he asked Saylor, "Hey Saylor, you know, if you're saying that Bitcoin is the best investment, why should I sell my Bitcoin or not just only acquire Bitcoin and instead buy into MSTR at that point?" Right? And Saylor said, well, if Bitcoin is your risk-free hurdle rate, then there's a part in your portfolio for risk.

(1:00:17) And as anybody with a portfolio, right, you have your Bitcoin and then you have gradients of risk and reward. And so as Jesse would say, right, if uh everybody here agrees that MSTR is an 800 pound gorilla, um that's not going to be um surpassed in a total Bitcoin holdings perspective, but at the same time, because of the law of large numbers, you're just not going to experience that much growth, right? MetaPlanet is um you know just uh two steps behind MSTR but the benefit of that is that they have a much smaller um uh capital base and and Smarter Web out of this whole entire spectrum of new Bitcoin treasury companies is just another iteration from that.

(1:01:08) So that's exactly how I view it and I structure my portfolio like that. So hopefully that was helpful. Um just two more questions. One is what events do we have on the calendar for the rest of the year?

**Andrew Webley:**
(1:01:21) Okay, so um so there's quite a lot going on at the moment. So Jesse and I will be in New York uh tomorrow um as as well. I so love to love to meet you guys.

**Jesse Myers:**
(1:01:34) Yeah. Yeah. Looking forward to it.

**Andrew Webley:**
(1:01:36) Yeah. And then um and then at the end of October um I'm going by myself to Singapore because you know obviously we do look after the costs that we spend. We try and get everywhere, but you know, it does cost money to fly places. Um, so that's something that some people gave me a bit of stick for. Um, Token2049. Um, but I believe it's my job to go out and speak to an unfriendly audience. Hopefully, they'll be friendly, but potentially unfriendly who like other things in addition to Bitcoin and tell them why a Bitcoin treasury company is by far the best Bitcoin treasury company in the world in part because it's the only asset that you can actually build a treasury on. I'll fine-tune that messaging before I get there.

(1:02:18) So, that's the next event. Um, then if we go into October, um, there's an institutional event in the middle of October, uh, which I don't know has been published yet. Um, so, um, I'm quite looking forward to to that one. Um, and then going into November, there's an event in London, which again, I'm not sure whether it's been published yet, but that should be quite good. Closely followed by Bitcoin Amsterdam uh which Jesse will all being well be be flying over for.

**Jesse Myers:**
(1:02:51) Um so that'll be the two of us, you know, going around and um speaking to everyone again.

**Andrew Webley:**
(1:02:57) Um we might have a special event, you know, very very shortly after that one, which again we're not allowed to talk about. Um so that should be quite good. Then looking into December, um we've got an event that I'm very much looking forward to. um don't know yet um whether Jesse will be there for reasons that we won't go into, you know, sort of I'm not sure he'll be able to travel then. Um I hope he can. He's more than welcome to come but if he can't then uh you know I'll do my best without him.

(1:03:27) So that's my friend's event which is in Abu Dhabi uh Bitcoin MENA. Um you know Greg puts on a fantastic event, probably the best Bitcoin event in the world. Um so yeah, looking forward to that one. Um, and then I'm sure there's lots of other things. Um, this weekend, uh, as soon as I get back from New York, I'm going to a UK event, which I'm very excited about because, you know, all the the international events are awesome. Um, but there's not that many events in the UK relative to the ones um abroad.

(1:03:58) So, there's um there's one which is in a place called Bury St Edmunds. It's quite a long way away from where I live, and I'm going there directly uh from the airport on Saturday. So, apologies to everyone if I'm sort of asleep uh when when you see me there. Um and then I believe there might be an event that's being organized um round about in the middle of the UK. Um I can't remember whether that's October or November. That'll be quite good. That's run by someone called Jordan, nice bloke as well. Um so there's lots of things going on, but I suspect that the diary will fill up considerably more than that. Um so that's a quick summary. Lots going on.

**Peter Dwan:**
(1:04:34) Wow. Uh but yeah uh it makes me a little bit grateful that I'm not working for a Bitcoin treasury company because you guys are just running on all cylinders.

**Andrew Webley:**
(1:04:45) Best job in the world. It's the best job in the world.

**Peter Dwan:**
(1:04:48) Okay. Well, one last question guys before I let you guys go. Hey guys, how do you feel about selling a small amount of Bitcoin puts based upon relevant variables?

**Andrew Webley:**
(1:04:58) You want me to answer that Jesse or do you want to?

**Jesse Myers:**
(1:05:02) Yeah. If you've got—Yeah, if you got thoughts on on I I guess it's probably cash secured puts like MetaPlanet does. Um yeah, Andrew, any—Yeah, go for it.

**Andrew Webley:**
(1:05:10) Okay, so um I don't think for a Bitcoin treasury company until you get to a certain scale that that's the right strategy. Um because you should be focusing on adding Bitcoin to your balance sheet, generating the Bitcoin yield at that point in in my opinion. Now, at the size that we are, I think it's an incredibly interesting strategy and I think maybe for the next 6 months, 12 months, something like that, maybe maybe even longer. Um, but for the scale that we're at, I think it is quite an interesting strategy for a small amount of your treasury.

(1:05:44) So, let's say you did a raise for, I don't know, call it 50 million pounds. Yeah. So if you took 10% of that raise, 5 million pounds, and allocated to that strategy I think it would be quite beneficial because you could also use that um that income you know to improve your um your balance sheet to cover some of your corporate costs and so on and so forth.

(1:06:10) But the hidden benefit that you get from that in addition to obviously creating the revenue to you know you know cover that which is you know what we're doing with the operating business as well. Um but the hidden benefit is you can use that cash if you get into a bare market to then you know sort of you know that's the one thing that I would consider buying back the stock you know in in with cash you know as opposed to with Bitcoin.

(1:06:37) Um so it's quite a good strategy but in in my opinion um we have debated this one we we debate everything as a team. Um, in my opinion, it's your sort of call it 2,000 to 10,000 Bitcoin. That sort of range where that sort of strategy is is sort of probably quite good. And being completely transparent, I haven't thought about once you get say to 10, 20, 30,000 Bitcoin, whether that strategy's got a role, but you know, rest assured in plenty of time before we get to that point, we will have worked out whether it's appropriate then. But definitely not for a small Bitcoin treasury company. That for one our size probably.

**Jesse Myers:**
(1:07:15) Yeah. And and the other thing in there is we know that there's a fair bit of—there's a lot of opportunity cost for that capital because you could you could be holding Bitcoin uh with that capital. Um you know I think it's worth pointing out that the the context for MetaPlanet and why it makes a lot of sense for them. Um they have this additional benefit of or or really kind of existential need to uh show positive income. Uh and and and that was necessary in the first year in particular to to to get off of uh uh I guess they were sort of like blackballed from certain um I forget you know what channels required them to have you know positive income before they could be you know offered to retail investors or or whatever it was.

(1:07:59) But um I think in Japan culturally it's very important to show that you make a profit and with the hotel business. They didn't uh have that. So they needed this this sort of Bitcoin operations business as they call it to generate a profit that would you know benefit the overall strategy you know in to such an extent that it made it very much worthwhile.

(1:08:29) And you have to factor in the tax. So it's it's not exactly the opposite of that, but it's almost the opposite of that in the UK where you'll effectively incur that that additional income above your base costs as a business, you know, would effectively be liable to to corporation tax then. You see, so like Jesse says, the opportunity cost of not holding the Bitcoin then creates an income after your costs a profit which you pay corporation tax on.

**Andrew Webley:**
(1:08:58) So, you know, I think and maybe this is something we discuss on an open forum with investors is how do they feel about paying, you know, effectively risking not having so much Bitcoin but then, you know, taking some of that um profit and then paying out to the government when it could be withheld within the business. But the sweet spot for me is um basically just a little bit more than your cost. So yeah, you might pay a little bit of tax but a minimum amount.

(1:09:32) But then you're not doing it just to cover your cost. You're doing it, it's like an insurance policy. Um but then you can also argue that that insurance policy if it's say 5 million against a treasury of say 500 million, you know, it's such a small amount, are you ever going to buy that much stock back with a couple of million quid, you know? Um so it's more complicated.

(1:09:54) And Jesse made the point earlier with something else that a lot of these things, you know, it's our jobs to think these things through from every little angle. Um because a lot of the time, you know, and I'm guilty of this as well. I'm always messaging them mega mega early in the morning saying, "Come up with this idea. What do you think about this?" They probably look at that phone and think, "Oh god, here we go again."

(1:10:12) Um, but a lot of these ideas until you debate them through as a team with loads of different opinions, you know, like take Albert, you know, our new CFO, very very experienced in tax, international tax as well. Um, you know, you you need the perfect solution for all of these things. And that's why if we take a step back and we look at our business model at the moment, you know, the strategy, as far as I'm concerned, is as close to perfect as you can get and it's simple.

**Peter Dwan:**
(1:10:39) Got it. Um, I just do want to add in my thought before we wrap up. The one thing that I didn't hear you guys mentioning is the fact that uh, MetaPlanet at least is going to use some of the cash secured puts income towards paying the preferred dividends uh, which again um, the preferred dividends uh, uh, I hear many people talk about it. You need at least about a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin before issuing preferred. So, I I don't know if once you guys cross that threshold, then issue preferreds and then use the cash secured puts to pay the dividends. Whether you'll need to be liable to corporate tax, I'm not a tax expert, but that's just something that I want to bring up.

(1:11:21) Okay. Well, perfect. Thank you guys so much for the time. Uh, this has been wonderful. Again, my name is Peter Dwan. I go by the uh by the Twitter handle BTC Bull Rider. This will be available on my YouTube channel called Bull Standard and I will be summarizing this in the next couple days. Hopefully I get to meet as many of you guys in New York as possible. Until then, take care. Bye.
