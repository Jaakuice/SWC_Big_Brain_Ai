**James:**
(0:00:00) The world of SWC episode 7. Um, I've got Jamie here. He's finally decided to switch his video on. Um, on uh X, he's at the Desert Ape. Um, so check him out. His posts are really useful. Um, before we get started, just the quick sort of disclaimer. Um, everything we talk about is not financial advice. It's for information and entertainment purposes only. Um, and any opinions expressed are the the person's own. So, let's get stuck into it. It's been just over a week since we last did one. Do you want to start with— Sorry. Do do I want to—

**Jamie:**
(0:00:45) The thing is it's so hard to even know where to start, right? I mean, it's um it's strange because um not to interrupt your flow, but last week I wrote a post titled I think this is arguably the best week in SWC's journey. And I'm going to be writing an update tomorrow, but I think comfortably that this week was even better in terms of, you know, price appreciation, news flow, updates, sentiment, etc. There's so many things to discuss today. Um, and I'm really looking forward to to discussing them. But, you know, you know, first of all, just from a price perspective, you know, we've had obviously an amazing few sessions. You know this time last Friday or after the close last Friday they announced an equity book build for you know a minimum 15 million pounds at £1.80. You know currently when I look you know the shares last were trading around £4.20 so that's 130% increase for those institutional holders that participated which I think is huge.

**James:**
(0:01:35) Yeah it's massive. I mean um I have to admit the share price is slightly higher than I expected after off the back of that. Um, you know, in my head I was 360 370 target um target price and we're sort of 40 50p above that.

**Jamie:**
(0:01:52) Yeah. And I think actually, you know, funnily enough that sort of pertains to a bigger theme that's going on is that, you know, when you look at everything that SWC's achieved in the sort of circuit two months since IPO, it's broken all expectations. You know, Andrew will also attest to that. And I think you know really you know there's clearly a paradigm shift that's going on top down bottom up uh and you know there's a lot of um expectation reset that's been done. You know, most people before IPO were saying two pound would be a great end of year target and now you know we've clearly surpassed that and there's a variety of new records or targets that are starting to be discussed which we'll obviously discuss today and um I think you know we're at a really really exciting time and the key thing is that a lot of this excitement is supported and backed up by tangible accomplishments you know it's not just hype I mean clearly there's a lot of um excitement around the share price, but there's a lot of execution and strategy that's actually being delivered to sort of validate, you know, all the price action that we've seen since IPO.

**James:**
(0:02:55) Yeah, for sure. I mean, um it's been pretty relentless, I think, is is the best way of putting it. Uh by raised by raised by, you know, um it's phenomenal. It's it's non-stop.

**Jamie:**
(0:03:08) And you know, actually, I think when you talk about the word relentless, I think it's worth giving a shout out to Andrew Webby, the CEO himself, because, you know, he's really been burning the candle at both ends. Um, for background, I run a, um, crypto advisory business, and I had the chance to attend the Digi Asset Conference this week in London, uh, where Andrew briefly presented. Um I had the chance to meet him very briefly and you know I wanted to congratulate him in terms of everything that he's achieved and you can see how hard he's working. Um and the most important thing for me was that you know the vibe and the energy that I got from him was exactly as you'd expect 100% genuine extremely humble trying to do his best. You know he realizes that you know he's doing this for so much for so many people. There's so many different causes that this champions, you know, in terms of, you know, his own personal legacy from the SWC original business he built to fund giving retail investors a regulated um instrument for people to get Bitcoin exposure to in the UK, which we've obviously lacked for many years. So, you know, I only had a few minutes to meet with him, but you know, I wished him all the best. And, you know, you'll obviously discuss some of the feedback uh that you had at Surrey. How was that?

**James:**
(0:04:25) Um, so I wasn't actually at Bitcoin, sorry. Um, that meet up, but um, I heard that he got a standing ovation. Um, loads of questions were asked. A lot of them we've covered on on here before. Um, you know, the general impression was from the feedback that I've had was that people kind of working out they either were investors already or they were working out how to invest um, as a result of CEO in the flesh, which is pretty cool. I saw some of the po— yeah re really really cool.

**Jamie:**
(0:04:55) Um and I saw actually some of the pockets of feedback that were sort of coming um through and I think you know what's really stood out to me James this week in terms of when I boiled down um you know everything in terms of um so let me take a step back and say um when you look at SWC there obviously there's a huge amount of positives but you know when you look at some of what could the potential bare cases be I think a lot of those have been addressed or partly addressed this week and those are things such as you know FCA regulation which I can discuss a little bit uh my own personal interpretation um issues around are they going to be able to continue to raise institutional capital as share price increases we've obviously sort of answered that um with the 21 million share subscription agreement that was announced and you know one of the things I thought was interesting from the takeaway at the Surrey meetup was Someone asked you know what happens when smarter web or sorry the broader market goes into a potential bare market can this strategy continue uh and my understanding is that you know an answer was sort of provided again and I'm sort of um my own interpretation here is that they have a very strong operating business so you know were we to go into a prolonged bare market for whatever reason you know smart web have a profitable operating business which they're able to sit back on all this bitcoin that they hold balance sheet is straight on the bottom line, you know, straight on the balance sheet. None of it's been bought by debt. And that again just puts us in a really comfortable position to have a very very um clear path going forward for the foreseeable future.

**James:**
(0:06:35) Yeah, I think it's clear that Andrew's um attitude towards debt is is very conservative. Uh you know, he's not said he'll never do it. The option of convertible bonds later might be quite appealing. Um but for now there's no it's not necessary. Um it's it's all going to plan. Um well it's exceeded my expectations but I get the impression this is maybe how he saw it um turning out. I don't know. But um going back to that equity raise from the end of last week. It feels like a lifetime ago now and and people are probably over it now. But um just a reminder that they aimed for £15 million um and they got 29.3 million. So they nearly double— it was oversubscribed. Um and he took the amount of money that he wanted to get in order for the dilution to be right based on on the market cap and the and the shares in issue. So that's a pretty strong position to be in at this stage I would say. What do you think Jamie?

**Jamie:**
(0:07:35) Yeah, completely agree. Um, and I think there's two uh very key points. I think first of all, like you said, the fact that they managed to raise significantly more than the minimum. It was almost 2x. They were, like you said, the minimum was 15. They got just under 30. Um, and I think, you know, clearly, um, one of the interesting things that we've learned subsequently are the quality of investors that were coming in at that elevated price. We'll come into this specific bit of news in a sec, but um there was a press release saying that Jesse Myers was now going to be a Bitcoin strategic uh consultant for SWC. He participated in the raise. That was public knowledge. Um and I think you know what's even more interesting is the performance post the book build. So the shares, as I said, are now up 130% post the book build of last week. Now why that's so important is because this is very likely to attract further interest from active managers. So you know if you take a step back and look at the UK equity market in general we are a very defensive market. What we're the the majority of the stocks in the footsy 100 250 are consumer staples their farmers they're tobacco um their homebuilders. You know we don't have a big high growth tech sector like the NASDAQ. So what that means is that there tends to be very uh much less volatility within the within the index and that means it's obviously harder for active managers to outperform each other and passive funds as well. So by having stocks like SWC by even having a small allocation you can effectively reduce asymmetric returns or or can significantly outperform peers by you know having a small percentage of your fund in something like this. And I think over time as people start to catch on to this that's going to help to bring in more uh funds from active managers. So you know that for me is a really really big point. Uh and clearly there's going to be subsequent effects if you get into like the Footsie 250 footsy 100 etc. But you know worth flagging that we've still not seen any new institutional holders breaking above that 3% level. You know, as a reminder for people in the UK, if you own over 3% of the company, you have to declare. We've still not seen that, but you know, my personal expectation, again, my own view is that in due time, we we're very very likely to see, you know, people popping up on the list, which will continue just to build more credibility um into the share price, which has clearly been an ongoing theme.

**James:**
(0:10:05) Yeah, for sure. And I think um you know with regards to that sort of uh allocation of capital it's a bit like the um the recommendation from BlackRock of adding 1 to 2% of Bitcoin to your uh exactly portfolio. The the sharp ratio improves and you know uh it's actually a better bet than not having it in your portfolio at all.

**Jamie:**
(0:10:28) Yeah. Exactly. And and that's a fantastic paper to get anyone to go see and and it really just does highlight that by having they did like a matrix just showing by the various percentages that you could allocate to your portfolio and the impact that the volatility had to your effective return profile and just you know over the subse the previous years had you had a bitcoin allocation how much you would have outperformed and how much that subsequently would have compounded as well. Uh, and I think we're going to continue to see that um, you know, play out in terms of that news spreading and see more active managers and institutional investors interested in smarter web.

**James:**
(0:11:08) For sure. I mean, the next bit I just want to sort of caution people. These are approximate numbers based off community-based calculations. These aren't um direct from SWC or um or Andrew, but roughly speaking, the cash we have on hand now um including and including the Bitcoin that we own, we have a total sort of net net asset value um equivalent to about 650 Bitcoin. um which puts us well over halfway to the initial 6 month uh well no 4 month target of um 1,000 BTC. So it's looking likely, you know, as long as performance uh keeps going the way it has been, we're going to hit 1,000 Bitcoin uh within 100 days. Um which is just incredible. Um that that equivalent of 650 Bitcoin um by the way would put us at number 36 on the uh hoddle list. Um you know it doesn't seem like yesterday we were kind of 100th or 98 or or something like that. Um so I I don't know. Every week this this this company just keeps blowing my mind and I can't— my mind keeps saying you know oh well you know surely it's going to slow down and then does another thing and and away we go again. Um the the the other big news from from this week is um the 21 million share subscription agreement um which is as much of an ATM as you can get in the UK. Um, do you want to try and explain that for people a little bit? Um, or do you want me to?

**Jamie:**
(0:12:45) Well, do do you want to go first and then you know you're you're in the flow then I'll sort of just uh piggyback on—

**James:**
(0:12:52) So so the way I've understood it is that um SWC they placed 21 million shares and then they give them to uh Shard who then sell those into the market. So they are selling shares into the market probably through a more sophisticated system but much like you or I would. Okay. So they are selling at the bid price. Um and they have a sort of bottom uh threshold which is the market close price from the day before. So they will not sell um if the if the bid price is below the market close bid price from yesterday. They're also limited to selling up to a maximum of 20% of the volume um that on that trading day and but that 20% of the volume also includes the OTC volume. So it's not just the uh the Aquis volume. This 20% is not a guaranteed 20%. You know there's people throwing out you know really bullish calculations of oh today we could have made this much money. Um it's probably going to touch 20% on on incredibly heavily traded days, uh high volume days, but um on quieter days, it's going to be throttled back. So, um you know, it's not a guaranteed 20% every day. Um anything else you want to add on that, Jamie?

**Jamie:**
(0:14:05) Yeah, I mean, there's so much great news to discuss this week. Um it's uh but this for this for me I would say has probably been the most important piece of news that's actually come out um effectively since the start. Um and the reason is is because it gives them a completely new uh and unique tool to raise or convert fiat into bitcoin. So, you know, to take a step back, one of the things that um everyone knows uh Micro Strategy for has been the fact that in the US they have an ATM facility that allows them to issue shares, sell those into the market and compress the MNAV when it's high and turn that into Bitcoin and subsequently increase their Bitcoin per share ratio. With smarter web in the UK we don't have that sort of typical US uh functionality it has to be done through the subscription agreement. For all but for all intents and purposes it's very similar but one of the ways— so the only way presently to date SWC had managed to raise capital had been through book builds one on the retail side which as you know the capacity for that is now full until next year or two on the institutional side as well. Now the institutional side tends to be um a slower process because you obviously need to have, you know, potentially institutional demand lined up. There's questions about what price it is. Um there's it's uh from an operational and logistical uh perspective, it's very time consuming and it's very very intense. What the subscription agreement allows them to do is effectively be opportunistic and strategic to take advantage of times when the SWC price or the MNAV blows out to very very high levels and allow them to sell shares that effectively can then be converted into Bitcoin. Uh and so you know currently I think when I last look the MNAV and again this is using all community-led um data from the smarter investment guy I think when I last looked the MNAV was you know just a touch under 18x if I look here if that's correct and that's um you know obviously gone up consistently from the day before where it was like 15.7 etc. But now with this MNAV at this higher multiple they effectively have to sell less shares to generate one Satoshi. So it's extremely um accretive or you know what people are saying Micro Strategy sort of came up with this phrase of the accretive dilution whereby you can sell shares less shares to generate more Bitcoin per share. Um, and you know, just to sort of um, highlight how powerful that is, I, you know, I ran some numbers. Um, and I think this time last week, the Bitcoin per share for Smarter Web was around 20 Satoshi's, which meant that you had to, based on the share count meant that you had to own 4.7 million shares, I think equivalent to have one Bitcoin. Currently, the BTC per share is around 157 Satoshi's per share, which means that you only now need to own 637,000 shares to effectively own one BTC equivalent. So, this mechanism allows them to be very flexible, you know, very nimble, etc. And I think you know the key thing also is the fact that it puts a big line or at least helps to alleviate some of the concerns from bears that okay well how are they going to keep raising money from institutional capital? Who are they going to need to tap up? Who's going to be the next institution to come and participate? And this allows them to sort of do everything by themselves uh via Shard who you know um are an asset manager and over time they'll accumulate data. They'll be able to refine the strategy, etc. And you know, it reminds me very much of when Strategy announced the 21-21 plan back in Q3 of last year that they were going to raise 21 billion by an ATM, 21 billion by fixed income. They had a three-year time horizon to effectively do that. They did it within 6 months. And I wouldn't be surprised to see SWC getting through this very very quickly and potentially reloading again because remember one of the key metrics that we're looking at is SATs per share, you know, BTC per share both from an absolute perspective and the growth perspective and that's obviously going to continue uh to move higher um as a result um of this new mechanism. So super super positive news.

**James:**
(0:18:35) Yeah. And um I was just trying to do the the mental arithmetic on those stats that you gave that I think that equates to if you'd put in the equivalent of one Bitcoin at IPO um you'd now own more than the equivalent of um uh one Bitcoin. You'd own um 1.5 Bitcoin. You you'd own most Satoshi's effectively.

**Jamie:**
(0:18:58) Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Per share. So, so if so effectively if you had if you put in 100 if you put in call it $100,000 at the time of the IPO and you bought Bitcoin, you'd have X amount of Satoshi's and if but if you put it into SWC the amount of Satoshi's that you'd hold via the equity would actually be higher. So I can run the numbers on that. Um one and a half uh times. Okay. Okay. Exactly. Satoshi's.

**James:**
(0:19:25) Yeah. And and that's, you know, again, not to divert the conversation too much, but that's obviously sort of one of the questions or sort of one of the responses to the question of, well, why would people want to own Smarter Web as opposed to just owning an ETF or when an ETN eventually gets um allowed for retail investors in the UK, why would they choose Smarter Web versus just owning it outright, you know?

**Jamie:**
(0:19:48) And outside of the cost issue which you have to pay to own the ETN here, you're actually getting over time more satoshi's per share because of the fact that SWC has access to a variety of capital market instruments that they can utilize.

**James:**
(0:20:05) Yeah. And it's it's you know it's accelerating. You're you're getting a a better return than than than spot bitcoin, right? That's that's that's why we're all here.

**Jamie:**
(0:20:15) Yeah. Absolutely. That that that's correct as well. Um and so, you know, I really do think that, you know, the bullish of this, you know, cannot be overstated. Um and it's a really elegant mechanism for them to sort of just be very very nimble and convert that high nav and put it straight into Bitcoin. Uh and I'm really think over time they'll be able to refine this. I think like I said, you know, from my I was trying to do a little bit of work yesterday to understand whether there were any exchange or regulatory caps on how much they can effectively issue via this mechanism. I haven't found anything so far. Um, and my understanding is that even if there are, most of it would effectively require a shareholder. It would go to a shareholder AGM vote. Uh and when you look at the shareholder structure for SWC, you know, when you add the biggest holders who clearly have an aligned interest, it's a relatively safe assumption to assume that you know that this would be passed. So this this yeah for me just opens the door to so many possibilities.

**James:**
(0:21:18) Obviously that would want to be avoided because that would slow things down a bit potentially. But um I I did similar research and and I couldn't actually come up with anything any sort of restriction or limit um other than what was put in the admissions document which was uh you know the rights to issue up to 2 billion shares I think it was. Um and we're we're at 220 million at the moment. So I think you know that's plenty for now. I think I think I think we're safe for for now. And uh you know it's so funny because that announcement actually came on the same day as they announced their biggest Bitcoin purchase to date which is the first one over 100. But it you know that got completely sort of like overlooked to a certain extent by you know the the subscription news. Um and I think it's it's really really uh exciting and obviously the US market was shut yesterday. Um, and you know, I do think that, you know, there'll be a little bit of catch up to sort of, um, you know, uh, start to, as people start to price that in, as well as obviously the announcement that came the day before, um, with regards to, uh, you know, the Jesse Myers appointment.

**Jamie:**
(0:22:25) Yeah. I'm just going to share a screen.

**James:**
(0:22:28) Yeah.

**Jamie:**
(0:22:30) And and actually sorry James just wanted to flag one thing which I think it ties um back into the subscription agreement is you know this week um we've obviously seen um or consistently we've started to see the volume profile for SWC continue to rise both in the London and in the US line which I think has been super constructive and that's not only been in terms of total volume um in terms of number of shares and and um uh notional traded, but also in terms of the sizes of the individual trades. You know, I flagged in a recent post that we're starting to see much larger clip sizes going through. You know, previously they've been in like the 10 to 30,000 limit, a range that then went up to sort of 30 to 70,000 and now we're starting to quite actively see trade sizes of £100,000 or higher going through which tends to be institutional flow. Um, and I thought that was extremely constructive.

**James:**
(0:23:25) Yeah. And I think I saw a single transaction uh that was posted after close yesterday that was one over 1.6 million. Um, which was pretty cool to see. It's there might there may have been a bigger one, but um that's the biggest I've seen.

**Jamie:**
(0:23:42) So, just just on the screen share, those of you that maybe don't know Jesse or don't know much about him, um this is the thing. This this image um of his uh well the global assets and how they're kind of um uh divided up. You may recognize it from um a lot of Michael Saylor's stuff because he he's used it for a couple of years now I think um since Jesse did the first one. One of one of my takeaways from this actually uh was was that the global uh the total global asset value has gone up from 900 trillion to uh 1,000 trillion um in the two years since he first produced this. Um so you know if people aren't printing money I don't know where that asset value's come from. Um but yeah, so that that's kind of what what drew me to Jesse initially. Um incredibly intelligent guy. He's been around in Bitcoin for ages. Um he knows his stuff and uh you know he's he adds um a level of credibility to SWC certainly in the states where where he's very well known. Um, and you know, I'm I'm super pleased it was him that joined the team. I'm just annoyed that I didn't uh didn't manage to grill it out of him when I met him at the shareholder meet up in Vegas.

**James:**
(0:25:00) Yeah. Well, honestly, when I saw the RNS come out, my jaw hit the floor because it was it was literally the equivalent, I think, of a Galactico signing, you know, and like you said, everyone knows him via a lot of the research that he's done in Bitcoin. He's obviously an experienced uh Bitcoin industry operator. He's been in the um sector for a long time. You know, he's very well spoken. He's very well liked, very well followed. Um and he's obviously built a big business and a great business which is Onramp um which is an asset management platform for Bitcoin. And you know, I think it's going to just continue to add um further depth uh and solidify the credibility of SWC and the fact obviously as well publicly, you know, he came in uh for the previous race uh which was announced via the RNS and that already adds on to like a a really exciting team, you know, with Tyler Evans, you know, David Bailey, Andrew, now Jesse, obviously US-based will have a huge network of um uh both cryptonative and traditional um connections as well to help educate them about the potential of SWC. I just think it's it was it was huge. And it was actually funny that day because on the day it was announced was the day which was I think I believe it was Wednesday was it Wednesday or two—

**Jamie:**
(0:26:18) I think it was Wednesday. Tuesday the— Yeah.

**James:**
(0:26:22) So Tuesday the night before obviously was when the geopolitical tension started to pick up. Then on the Wednesday um the announcement came the shares were weak obviously sort of had a big markdown I think just with the broader risk off market and I think start— like as people started to get more comfortable that announcement started to be priced in and you know the shares obviously went from like two I think they touched like 240 at one stage I remember seeing them like 270 and went straight through three pound uh and now we're obviously trading well above £4 pound.

**Jamie:**
(0:26:58) Yeah, I think for for the briefest of moments it was 2 pound 35. Um that was the lowest I saw which is just—

**James:**
(0:27:05) Yeah.

**Jamie:**
(0:27:08) And and you— I know it's— I mean yeah I wish I I wish I was had the chance to to buy some there but you know he's already started to get very actively involved in the community. He announced uh yesterday some u just an interactive discussion around you know who um we'd like to see um you know Andrew or himself um where they'd like to be in terms of podcasts or shows etc to continue to get you know the word out on SWC and maybe actually um James that's a good point to maybe talk about you know some of the um notes we discussed with regards to um SWC getting more viewership in sort of all increasing coverage from the US.

**James:**
(0:27:52) Yeah. So, um I mean hope— before I start that hopefully Jesse's going to come on a pre-recorded uh interview with me um in the coming coming weeks. So, um keep an eye out for that. Um yeah, so I don't know there's there's so many names. I think we mentioned a few last week. Um the likes of Adrian Morris, Adam Livingston, um uh Tim Kotzman. Tim Kotzman. He— So Andrew's been on his podcast twice now. Um you've got um— Oh, why is my mind gone blank? Uh you've got uh Grain of Salt, Adam Livingston. Adam Livingston, did we say?

**Jamie:**
(0:28:32) Yeah. Yeah, we mentioned Anders as well from this week.

**James:**
(0:28:38) Anders. Yeah, he did an interview with with Andrew on Wednesday. Um yeah, the word spreading um and we even appeared on a slide um of— is it Alex Moss? Uh somebody Moss, I can't remember his name. Um at BTC Prague this morning um Smart Web Company got a little uh mention there.

**Jamie:**
(0:28:58) Did they get a little little shout out?

**James:**
(0:29:02) Did it. You know, I haven't seen the the video, but um we were definitely featured on one of the slides. Well, I'm I'm going to call it here first. So, um by my— So, by my calculation, SWC is the fastest company to ever do 100x from IPO in the history of capital markets. Um I did a lot of research this week. Hold on. Oh, sorry. Can you hear me? Just timed out.

**Jamie:**
(0:29:28) Yeah.

**James:**
(0:29:30) So from from my calculations, SWC is the fastest company to ever do 100x from IPO. It went from two pound sorry 2 and a half p to 2 pound 50 this week. Um which I think uh when I last remember that took 50 you know 51 or just just a touch over 50 days between 50 to 60 days. And hold let me actually just confirm the number actually now. Um, it did it 51 days ago at the time of writing. And from my calculations and research, the closest company that had ever come to doing that was Monster Beverage in the US, which took 9 and a half years. Now, this has all been powered by Bitcoin. So I can fully see at some point Michael Saylor with a slide saying the fastest performing 100x in the history of capital markets was in the UK smarter web because it adopted a Bitcoin treasury strategy. That is the power. Um and I think it's still not really being picked up this stat. I saw David Bailey talking a little bit about it today, but you know, from my perspective, there's nothing to stop us, you know, being the fastest stock to ever do a 1,000x since IPO, which would be £25. Um, when, who knows? But, you know, that for me is is well within the realms of possibility based off the accumulation path, the strategy they're executing, etc. And I really feel at some stage Michael Saylor is going to use that as a key slide of his.

**Jamie:**
(0:31:05) Yeah. I mean a 1,000x from IPO is only only um like a 6-12x from here right. So that that's exactly it.

**James:**
(0:31:15) I mean think about it. So if we if we're 4 now right let's just call it £4. Double once that's eight. Double again that's 16. Double again that's 32. Right? It only has to double three times. And you've seen how quickly it can do this. Right? So it's not outside the realms of possibility. And you know, it's funny because people will throw market cap stats at you. People will say, "Oh, well, look, it's overvalued because they only have X on on the balance sheet and it's currently trading at this market cap." I think those whilst potentially those have some argument like a lot of this sort of um rhetoric has to really be sort of ripped up and viewed with a new lens because this is a completely unprecedented corporate story in UK history. Like this is the first time anything like this has ever been replicated. Um and so there's no model to back test it against you know there's nothing to historically compare it with. Uh and so that's why I think you know there's a huge paradigm shift going and you know a lot of these uh records are there to be broken and you know in my personal perspective they will be and you know you can model it out and you can see that there is a a viable path to achieving these.

**Jamie:**
(0:32:22) Yeah. And you know just some other— yeah not financial advice just just my just my own my own personal perspective.

**James:**
(0:32:30) It's all right we covered that.

**Jamie:**
(0:32:32) Um yeah some other stats to kind of go with that. Um I think it's that uh SWC is three times larger than the next biggest company on on the Aquis exchange. Um it's some some of its trading days it has eight times the combined value of the rest of the exchange put together trading. Crazy, right?

**James:**
(0:32:55) Right. Yeah. I I mean— Yeah. I mean I I think so— I read that Smarter Web and Quincylium effectively now account for over 95% of all volume that's being done on the Aquis exchange at the moment. And you know, I think uh on Hargreaves Lansdown, we were the second most traded stock this week. Um and coin was 10th. Um you know, and there were names like BP on there and Rolls-Royce and you know, um household UK names. Um so it's amazing to see SWC beating most of those companies.

**Jamie:**
(0:33:32) Yeah, exactly. And I think, you know, to sort of um expand on that a little bit further, um Crab Apple um who you should follow if you don't, he puts out some great stats just showing um actually the um percentage of shares traded as a sorry, the amount of shares traded as a percentage of total shares and the the the total value traded as a percentage of market cap. And the reason why that's important is because it effectively shows you how much like interest there is in a stock. It's a it's a metric that strategy and Michael Saylor like to use a lot to show that they're again in his words effectively the hottest stock in the US. And I believe when I looked last, you know, SWC were effectively right at or close to the top in terms of like UK um in terms of UK equities. So there there's a huge amount of interest and what it really just means is that pound-for-pound they're punching well above their weight, you know, across a variety of metrics.

**James:**
(0:34:28) Yeah. And I think we'll kind of continue on with with a few more metrics um at this point. Um, I'm just going to bring up the Nyx uh at Bitcoin B21's um website. Uh, the smarterinvestmentguy.com. This is the the the like go-to place as far as I'm concerned for stats. Um, it it's updated daily. So, you know, if there's a 7 a.m. uh Bitcoin buy, for example, um it will be updated at some point that day. So, it's not it's not um uh automatically updated. So, sometimes the data may be a little bit out of sync, but it's it's pretty much done daily. Um I think uh BTC per share, that's what I was going for. Firstly, I prefer looking at this on a phone because uh it's all a lot steeper. But um um the the the the bit that really catches my eye on this one is the 8% daily growth. Okay. So that's that's what it is currently. Um but if you look at the uh white dotted line it yeah it wobbles a bit but it's roughly uh a consistent gradient which means that the daily growth has been roughly 8% since IPO um on the BTC stats per share. Um if you compound 8% a day over even quite a short period of time that's insane growth. Um, yeah, you know, and and and the future price predictions that you you could try and and generate off the back of that. Um, they they blow my mind. You you don't get past August, uh, past July, sorry, and the numbers are already starting to look like, you know, if you told someone down the pub, oh yeah, by the way, this stock's going to go up by that amount by the end of next month, they would call you insane. Um, so yeah, I I just love it. It's it's such a good um uh website.

**Jamie:**
(0:36:25) Exactly. And and and that's exactly why again, you know, the 21 million subscription agreement was so important because it's another tool to help them maintain this accumulation path.

**James:**
(0:36:38) Yeah. It's added a second lever, right? So, we're not just relying on on the equity raises, which as we know take some time to to come through to an actual Bitcoin buy, right? The the 29.3 million that landed yesterday um was from a raise on Friday. Um so you're already 7 days— 7 days before they get the money from when they announced the raise. Um and then that money is then as far as we're aware and the way we understand how Andrew is talking about it, it's kind of dollar cost averaged into Bitcoin. I think he's sped up that that dollar cost averaging um because he was at one time uh there was uh a higher proportion of of cash to Bitcoin um which implies that he's kind of speeding that up a little bit. I mean if we uh which one is it? Is it that one? No. Here we go. So this is uh net asset value. Um you know the— he's got 4 days of us having that money in the bank, but it did actually only arrive yesterday. Um and we made a Bitcoin purchase, I think predominantly from uh funds that we already had available. Um not entirely, but predominantly. Um which leaves us a lot of headroom. I think one of the things I'd like to to cover is um there's everyone's got their own way of working out uh MNAV of um days to cover all that kind of stuff and none of us are going to be right because none of us have actually got the actual balance sheet figures that SWC have. We're all making assumptions and guesses and you know we're trying to work out how much it cost them in fees to do that raise. It's we're trying to work out um you know how long things are going to take and and none of us know. So the way I like to look at it and I I kind of subscribe to to the way Nick's done this website is cash plus Bitcoin because yeah Andrew has shown conviction to change that cash into Bitcoin over a you know a few days a week. Um, and so therefore, um, we, well, I trust that that cash is going to turn into Bitcoin, so I include it in in the MNAV calculation. What do you think, Jamie?

**Jamie:**
(0:38:45) Yeah, completely agree. Um, and I think also when you look at uh, the research report from Tennyson, they calculated the same way as well, and I think that's the consensus. So, completely agree with you.

**James:**
(0:38:58) Um, on the subject of days to cover, this is my other kind of favorite chart. And then we'll we'll we'll maybe move away from the charts a little bit, but um so this uh currently we're on 52 days on on Nick's website. Um again, other people calculate it differently. Um with 23.44p per share um net asset value and the current price at £4.20. What I love about this chart is the is the forward projection. So just by putting a a line of best fit through um the net asset value, if we had a one times MNAV um by the 16th of September, the share price would be £31 or just under if um we keep up the pace that we're going at. That's a one times MNAV. Um and I remember when he first produced this uh I think it was something like 20 in August was possible. Um and I was kind of like h get out of here, you know, that's that's a crazy number. I think we're at like I don't know a pound or something at the time. Um, and now I'm starting to go, okay, yeah, maybe £32.69 on the 17th of September doesn't seem that outrageous. And that's at one times MNAV. If you go up to the five times MNAV, you're looking at um, why can't I see that? A very big number. Uh, £162.50.

**Jamie:**
(0:40:32) At a very big number and you know what's in— it's sort of you sort of have to scratch your head as well again and again it's sort of like really trying to shift your thinking in terms of like the paradigm and you know I think one of the things that I like about this particular graph is that as the more data points come through as time goes on you can see the trend continuing to solidify and that quantifiable data helps you to get more comfortable around, you know, the forward predictions. And there have been some really nice charts uh on MetaPlanet that have been produced by some of the community members showing similar things like this, but these sort of like quantifiable graphs that effectively show you their path um in terms of like BTC accumulation, the nav, the the back out, the share price, etc. Um and so yeah, you sort of like have to take a deep breath when you look at this one, don't you?

**James:**
(0:41:28) Yeah, for sure. I I will just do one last thing. Um, go on. Based on cash and uh and Bitcoin using Nick's website, which is the one that I I go with, the calculated MNAV at the moment is 17.92, which you know, you could argue is running a little bit hot. Um but I think for me um you know with with the such short days to cover and um we're we we're coming towards the end of the raise cycle right so the raise was announced Friday last week uh we got the money yesterday we we're literally waiting for when the next announcement um will be for the next raise um and it tends to run a bit hotter uh towards that the end of that cycle.

**Jamie:**
(0:42:12) Cool. Because perhaps front running and anticipating the next raise, I don't know.

**James:**
(0:42:18) Um well, yeah. And maybe James— Sorry, Jamie, worth just highlighting again for people um if they want to participate in future raises, there is actually an option.

**Jamie:**
(0:42:30) Yeah, for sure. So, um there's there's kind of two options really. One is um if you're a higher net worth individual um looking to invest more than £50,000 um you can contact Tennyson's direct um and they can sort you out. Um and the other side is um if you are registered as a professional investor um and you have uh an amenable broker that you use then um there's the possibility of going down that route as well. So it's not impossible for um like in quotes retail to be uh involved in these raises. Um but it's you know it is kind of restricted to to to certain individuals.

**James:**
(0:43:10) Yeah. And um did did you want to— you know one of the charts I know you've just clicked off but obviously the BTC accumulation race chart which I think is the one that uh most— well yeah exactly because definitely worth bringing back up especially as you know you know one of the key bits of news has been that you know Andrew has communicated they want to get to a thousand Bitcoin within four months. Uh MetaPlanet did it in six. So you know that really is sort of a a short-term target for us.

**Jamie:**
(0:43:42) Yeah. And and you know, looking at that chart, you've got um Cooler well within the sights now. Um and Similar not far off that. If we converted all of our cash into Bitcoin, um I believe we would be yeah just above uh or or maybe in line with where Cooler um Cooler are or were at our stage I should say and then you're only 300 less than 300 Bitcoin away from where um uh Semler were at at this stage of their Bitcoin journey, which is just amazing. You know, Semler started with what 600 Bitcoin um and and and Cooler somewhere around 200. Phenomenal in in in 2 months. Uh we're we're already showing how aggressive uh SWC can be. Um and everyone thought, you know, MetaPlanet was was the most aggressive out there, right? Um, and I'm not saying they haven't been aggressive. They have. Um, it's just we're kind of forging the UK path and it seems to be working pretty well for us.

**James:**
(0:44:45) Yeah, exactly. And I think what's— I think what's um why MetaPlanet is an interesting comparison is because they obviously have a very established equities market. You know, I think um they have obviously a very large economy in Japan, the UK, but the key thing is that they don't have an ETF available for retail, which is the same as the UK as well. Um, and I think whilst their individual capital markets instruments are slightly different than ours, the fact that they don't have an ETF I think is of particular interest because it's probably like the most like for like you know if you compare it with someone like the Blockchain Group there have which is listed in France there have been ETFs or ETPs available from you know 21 22 23 depending on your jurisdiction uh and market access um and it's worth flagging— And I think this is a really critical point for maybe international investors to know is that in the UK there are 1.3— there's effectively 1.3 trillion pounds of capital that sit in tax-efficient wrappers which are an ISA uh and a SIP. Um and none of that has effectively had a place to buy Bitcoin exposure. So there's a huge amount of pent up demand and pent up frustration as well from UK retail investors who've not been able to participate or get exposure to the best performing asset you know in the history of finance. And so via companies like SWC people are finally going to have that. And you know, if you even get a small amount of that starting to rotate in, I mean, you know, you can you can just start to think about what that's going to do to the share price, then obviously what that then does to market cap, what that then does to where it is in various indices, tracker flow, etc. You know, there's so many subsequent layers that can unfold as we start to go. Um, but I think yeah, just just very very exciting.

**Jamie:**
(0:46:42) Yeah, it feels like maybe the doors being opened at least to crack uh to to kind of open up restrictions in the UK and um and maybe move towards them being the— what's the word uh or phrase— uh the crypto capital of the world. I think they they're trying to shill to us and then doing nothing about. Um I hope so. So yeah. Um I'm hopeful that at some point that'll happen. We we do do tend to lag the the states by some margin.

**James:**
(0:47:12) Have you have you got any— have you got any thoughts then James— Again it's just us just tracking between ourselves in terms of like you know it feels like that thousand bitcoin limit is going to get hit you know you know have you got any thoughts of your own of like where we go from here or or how this could unfold?

**Jamie:**
(0:47:32) So it was in the Vegas interview that I spoke to Andrew about this you know what's the next target after a thousand um and it's maybe a slightly early question to ask because it was of course— Yeah, that was back in May. Um, he sort of said, "Oh, you know, we could go for 2,000." And then sort of smiled and said, "Uh, but, you know, 5,000 is also a possibility or something like that." I I'm I'm going to put it out there now. I I think Andrew should be aiming for 10,000 as the next target. Go for a 10x. Um, you know, what time frame he wants to put on that, that's that's up to him. Uh, and this is just my opinion, not— this is not based on anything, but I think um, you know, I think 2,000's too small because we've done a 1,000 in um, less than 3 months or we will have done in in a few weeks. Um, and I think 5,000. Yeah, it's good. It's good. But the the the market's responding to big plans. You know, Semler, I think, came out and said they want to buy 105,000 Bitcoin over the next two and a half years um today. Uh and you know, they've got 5,000 at the moment. These these are big numbers that people are are throwing out. And I think um just from a uh investor engagement perspective, it's going to keep people engaged if they're seeing like, wow, they're going to go for a 10x. What do you think?

**James:**
(0:48:55) Yeah, I think the— I agree with you. I think I think the— so I think the market is going to reward that sort of boldness. I think the I think the the path obviously to a 1,000 feels very clear. Now they've got the subscription agreement which came out which effectively is 21 million shares. If you assumed all were sold at today's price that would equate to another 1,000 BTC easily. Um, and I think there's a very clear path to getting up to 10K, and I think 10K should be the next target. It's a nice number. It builds up nicely. Obviously, were they to get to 10,000, that would put them in the top 10. You know, Coinbase, I think, is number 10 with like 9,000. MetaPlanet got up to 10,000 now sit at number nine. Um, and you know, just throwing some numbers around, you know, MetaPlanet got up to a trillion market cap this week, uh, 5 million market cap, um, in terms of sterling. And so those are just, you know, some like very loose comps, but I think 10,000 for me would be, you know, a a credible and a viable target. And, you know, subsequently once that was reached, who knows? Could it, you know, could it be 100k? Again, we'll have to see, but I think 10,000 would be a very good balance in terms of like what's achievable um as well as what's ambitious.

**Jamie:**
(0:50:15) Yeah, for sure. Um, we are going to have to to call it here, I think. Um, we've probably got plenty more on the list of that we could have discussed. Um, if everyone can like and subscribe, share the community, you know, spread the word. Um the the community on X is growing at such a great rate. Uh over 2,200 people now I think. Um and you know that's down to you guys. That's down to you guys posting questions, posting content. You know uh Jamie's great writeups. Uh Zinc's writeups. They're all awesome content. Um and you know by putting it out there and retweeting and and all that kind of stuff. Um it it it helps grow the community um and get people interested in in Smarter Web. So um keep up the good work everyone. Thank you.

**James:**
(0:51:02) Fantastic. Cheers. Thank you James. See you next week.

**Jamie:**
(0:51:08) See you.
