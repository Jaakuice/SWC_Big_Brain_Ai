**James:**
(0:00:00) [Intro] Okay, we're live. Andrew, thank you very much for joining me. Um, it's always a pleasure to have you on. Um, it's been four weeks since we last spoke. Um, and two weeks since I've done a a live stream, um, due to being ill last week. So, just just the sort of update news um, since I was last on at least. Um, we SWT have purchased 345 BTC in two separate purchases and you've announced the launch of the smarter convert with with Tobam. Now, I'm sure every most people have seem to have moved on based on the questions they're submitting. Um, but uh I I would like to talk a little bit about that. Um is is there is there any sort of update on that since the launch?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:01:03) Um not so much as you know we we announced what Smarter Convert is. Um I think it took a day or two for everyone to sort of understand how positive it is. Um you know every everyone's seen that you know we we've used the capital to buy Bitcoin which is which is good. um

**James:**
[01:23] particularly with how it seems to be moving at the moment. Um I'm really pleased with it. Um we've had a lot of [01:30] inquiries about it. Um not not specifically about it, but in terms of [01:36] people interested in it. Um I think I've said on other live streams that um the [01:45] the next tranch that we do of Smarter Convert, whenever that may be, will be on um slightly better terms for the [01:51] company. Um, so it's not like anything, you know, nothing's set in stone. Um, we [01:59] were very keen to do it with Tobam and they were very supportive and helpful in in, you know, getting it to be a real [02:06] thing. Um, you know, I'm really proud that it's the first um, Bitcoin denominated bond in the UK as far as I'm [02:13] aware. um beneficial to shareholders in the sense that it's a it's an equity [02:19] placing providing it converts at a better price than than the time on the market i.e. 5% above with with the force [02:26] conversion aspect. Um but I I think you know there's there's quite a bit higher [02:31] that it could be priced. Um and I've got a number of different investors that are very very keen to do it. Um I think we [02:38] can only do something like 60 million more of it. Um, so, um, I'd be quite [02:44] surprised if that isn't filled in the not too distant future. Um, whether it's [02:49] before or after an equity raise, obviously I I I wouldn't be able to comment on. Um, but yeah, I'm really [02:56] pleased with it and I think it's a a really good product for the company. Um I don't think that a company would be

**James:**
[03:03] very strong doing that without having a core amount of Bitcoin that had been [03:09] bought um you know with equity because in the RNS you'll see that I said we we [03:15] would wouldn't go above 30% of our treasury exposed to that um for prudent reasons. Um so I think that it's the [03:23] right time to do it i.e. placements, ATM, staff facility, bond. Um, and then [03:30] we've got another thing that we're thinking about doing which is even better actually than smarter convert. But obviously I can't talk about that at [03:36] the moment. You can't talk about it. But is there anything you can say about it? [03:42] No, I can't I'm afraid because if I if I gave you a few clues um then it would [03:48] probably put it in a position where someone else might do it. And as far as I'm aware, no one else has done this in the world. Um um so I'm quite excited [03:56] about it but my lips are sealed for the moment. Innovating. I like it. Um so there's a [04:00] Smarter Convert Marketing [04:04] always um there's a few questions uh around the the smarter convert. Um [04:13] essentially I'm going to boil it into just two questions. How is it being marketed? And is there a one pager that [04:20] could maybe go on the website? uh a bit like the deck um so that it could be [04:26] shared by other people other than just yourself. Yeah, I'll speak to our advisers about [04:31] um sort of like a mini deck about it. Um everyone's got the RNS um so they can

**Andrew Webley:**
[04:37] see exactly what it's got. Um but I'll speak to them and see whether that's possible. Um because it's um [04:46] because it's it's quite an innovative product. it just fall falls into the [04:52] conversations that we have with everyone all of the time. Um so you know we speak to lots of different people um [05:00] constantly. Um you know like yesterday for example I was in London for the day speaking to different institutional [05:05] investors. You know we've been speaking to some of them for a period of time hopeful that we're not that far away [05:11] with some of them. Um and it just falls into those conversations. So it's not [05:17] it's not marketed any differently to how we market the smarter web company as the [05:22] overall proposition. It's just another option. Um there are some investors that [05:28] cannot do a Bitcoin denominated bond. So, some of the more traditional um [05:33] institutional investors because they're not allowed to hold anything um that's got that um they can hold an equity that [05:40] may have exposure to Bitcoin, but they can't hold um effectively a debt product that's denominated in the value of [05:46] Bitcoin. Um so, for for us, it makes our jobs a lot easier because, you know, [05:52] rather than speaking to these new investors about one type of um way they could support us, we've now got two [05:58] types of ways that they could support us. Excellent. Um, on to the ATM then. Um, [06:00] Daily ATM

**James:**
[06:07] there's been a few questions around this. Uh, are there any plans to adjust the 20% cap on the daily ATM and do you [06:14] think Shard are doing a good job? Yeah. So, um, the second part of the [06:20] question, Shard, I think they're doing a tremendous job actually. Um, I am very pleased with what they've done. Um, when [06:27] I look at the VWAP for the days against the days that they've sold it, they've almost always outperformed the VWAP. Um, [06:36] which is good. Um, in terms of how we could tweak it, I don't know how you could tweak it to [06:41] make it any better in all honesty. Um, I wouldn't want them selling more than 20%. Um, I don't think that you want to [06:50] go too much higher than that. Um, I've heard some people say that you should go lower. I think 20% is round about the [06:57] right number. Maybe we'll change it to 21%. Um, in terms of the sort of the down days [07:04] versus up days, I feel quite strongly about that. Um, that that we shouldn't use it on a on a down day. Um, so I [07:12] think that that's probably right. Um what we'll probably do um when we [07:18] announce you know the the next tranch of it which will be you know sort of in the near future hopefully um what we'll [07:26] probably do is we'll probably start counting the shares as they get sold when we get the cash [07:32] whereas what we did on the first sort of placement agreement which was split up into the tranches is we added those [07:39] shares onto our analytics dashboard at the start. So, so because the shares get [07:44] issued at the start, they will go into the market cap figure that you see on other websites because there'll be

**Andrew Webley:**
[07:50] shares in issue. Um, but we'll add them on to our analytics dashboard as they get sold because I think it's more [07:56] representative. Um, i.e. you're putting the shares on when you put the proceeds of the shares on. Um, so that's a tweak [08:04] I suppose. Um, but but broadly speaking, I think it will remain remain the same because I think it's working very very [08:10] well um for the company. And then the a sort of follow on for [08:15] ATM Pause [08:16] that is um people being pro ATM you know we [08:21] understand that it uh adds to the net asset value of the business um which [08:27] ultimately raises the floor etc. Um, but there are a few people, this isn't just on X, this is also on the Discord and [08:35] the and well Discord uh that would like to hear um of a pause [08:42] between ATM reloads to allow the share price to breathe for a bit um therefore [08:48] making future ATMs more accretive because the share price has gone up. Um what are your thoughts on that? [08:56] Um, yeah, it's I can understand why some people would think that, but for the [09:02] medium to long-term success of the business, I personally don't think um [09:07] that it's the right thing to do. Um, therefore, we will not do it. Um, I I [09:13] don't see what you'd benefit from with that in all honesty. Um, you know, if you look at the marketplace

**James:**
[09:19] as a whole the last sort of four or five weeks or whatever it's been, you know, MNAVs have been compressed across the [09:25] board. You know, as I've said before, I hold things like MetaPlanet and, you know, I was quite surprised actually when I woke up um in the middle of the [09:31] night. Um, and I had a look at MetaPlanet share price expecting it to be sort of, you know, flying. Um, and it [09:38] was down. Um, I don't know where it finished because, um, I haven't looked. Um so so I I I don't think that we [09:46] should do it differently than how we're doing it. Um I I think it's fair um in [09:53] my opinion that the company can benefit from its its its mnav um as well as the [09:59] investors. That's why the 20% sort of limit is is quite good. Um, so, [10:07] so yeah, I I I never want to give people bad news, of course, but I I I don't think that you'll be seeing a pause of [10:13] the ATM. Thank you. Uh, back to the smarter combat because I missed one of the [10:15] Minimum BTC Amount [10:19] questions. Um, what's the minimum amount of BTC an individual can discuss with [10:24] SWC for a smarter combat or or is it only institutions? [10:31] No, no, it's institutions or qualified investors. So there's a certain sort of [10:37] threshold that you've got to have um and some other things to be a qualified investor whether you're in the UK, the [10:43] US. Um I don't think from a from a from a sort of an admin point of view that we

**Andrew Webley:**
[10:49] would be able to do it with somebody who had less than say 10 or 15 bitcoin. Um something along those lines. Um what [10:56] we'd probably do um is if somebody had that sort of amount is we'd bundle them in with some other people that have [11:02] already contacted us with those sorts of amounts. Um so so you know it might be [11:07] you know the value of 50 Bitcoin let's say but with five different people that had subscribed for that. um [11:15] the that value is is above uh what what the value could be if you [11:21] went in the UK purely from a qualified investor point of view. Um but I think [11:27] it's probably the right sort of the right sort of number. [11:30] Subscription Vs Placing [11:32] Um you mentioned uh subscription and or subscribed. Um [11:38] Monday last week there was a subscription and a placing. Um [11:44] can you explain to people the difference between the two? One was a high netw worth individual, one wasn't. Uh one was [11:50] an institution just yeah why the difference? Yeah the the the easiest way of thinking [11:56] about it you know in simple terms is that they're the same thing. So a placing and a subscription are in [12:02] essence the same thing. the company issues shares, the person pays for those shares. Um, there are subtle [12:09] differences. Um, from our shareholders point of view, um, I think what you

**James:**
[12:15] would probably want to do is just think a placing means that it's done through a broker and a subscription means that [12:22] it's done direct with the company. So a subscription is better for the company [12:28] because you know all else being equal there's less or no commission paid. Um [12:35] placings have got different amounts of commission dependent on where they come from etc. Um so um that's probably the [12:42] way to think about it. Treat them as the same. Um but think a placing means it's come through the broker and a [12:48] subscription means that it's someone that's come direct to the company. [12:54] uh uh the news or fairly recent news of the [13:03] UK uh giving the green light to Bitcoin ATNS um one question was has that helped [13:10] discussions within with investors um and the other question was does it present any concerns? [13:16] Yeah, so I'm quite encouraged by that. I wish it was ETFs rather than ETNs. Um I [13:23] think that it's a very positive thing for the UK as a whole because it means [13:29] that the um the country is becoming more receptive to Bitcoin as an asset class. [13:35] Um so you know that's that's really positive. Um longer term, you know, 6 [13:40] months, 12 months, whatever. Um I think it's it's going to be a really beneficial thing for the company as well [13:46] because you know it makes it more accepted. Um it's as simple as that really in terms of the conversations

**Andrew Webley:**
[13:52] with investors then I think it helps as well because it shows that the UK is becoming more forward thinking. Um and [13:59] you can then go back to the example of what happened in the states when they um allowed ETFs. Um and you can all look at [14:07] the the the price of strategy since then. um which was pretty good. Um so um [14:15] so yeah, it's a positive thing. Anything that that makes Bitcoin more accepted is a great thing. And funnily enough, um [14:24] whilst I've noticed more people, you know, whether it's retail investors, you know, high netw worth individuals or the [14:31] institutions, I've noticed more of them become more receptive to Bitcoin over this three and a half month period. We [14:37] still speak to a lot of people that don't have any Bitcoin exposure. Um, so [14:42] you know, the ETNs and the FCA giving the green light for retail investors to hold this is really positive. [14:52] And um, you mentioned previously that it's becoming harder and harder to buy Bitcoin. Uh, are you able to talk about [14:58] why that is and and what's going on there? Yeah. So, when I said that [15:03] before, I meant that it was harder to buy Bitcoin without the price seeming to go up. Um, and I think since I said that [15:10] comment, everyone can see that the price has gone up. Um, and I believe that trend will continue. Um, so when we buy [15:18] the Bitcoin for the business, um, you know, we obviously execute those trades [15:24] as we think they should be done and there's different ways that we do that. Um, but when you're doing that, you do [15:29] notice, you know, even though we're not buying that much Bitcoin relative to some other people. Um, you do notice

**James:**
[15:36] what the market's doing. Um, so this isn't like a technical analysis or something. I don't use that to look at [15:42] Bitcoin. I just look at I've been looking at it for almost 10 years. So, I look at it and I have my opinion on [15:49] whether it's going up or down or whatever. Um, and so, so that's that's all I meant by that. When I was [15:56] executing the transactions, I could see that Bitcoin was looking harder to acquire without the price going up. Um, [16:04] I I um, funnily enough, um, and people [16:10] ask me this as well about the price of Bitcoin, you know, should it, you know, is Bitcoin, you know, going down a good [16:16] thing? Is it staying flat a good thing? But with the stage that we're at for the business, the very best thing that can [16:21] happen is Bitcoin goes up. You know, it makes it the value of what we hold up. [16:26] Um, and it also makes raising new capital easier. Um, and in theory the [16:32] share price higher, so it's less dilutive, you know, in in real terms, i.e. the gain in the share price to gain [16:38] in the Bitcoin price. Um, one thing that people don't um, often talk about as [16:43] well is in in all of our announcements, we announce the price of Bitcoin in pounds because we're a UK firm, so [16:49] everything is done in pounds, but then we also put the the current exchange rate for the price of what we've [16:54] acquired. Um, and also for the price of all of the Bitcoin that we've bought. Um, and so people don't often talk about [17:01] the exchange rate movements when they're talking about the price of Bitcoin and how that's changing. Um, so you know, in

**Andrew Webley:**
[17:07] very simple terms, if the price of Bitcoin goes up by half a percent and the the the pound goes down against the [17:14] dollar by half a percent, Bitcoin hasn't really changed in value for us. Um, so that's something that people should [17:19] maybe start thinking about a little bit. It doesn't make a big difference in the grand scale of things, but when you're [17:24] looking at the change on a quiet day of the price of Bitcoin, it's also important to look at the the the value [17:30] of the pound against the dollar. Yeah. Um, [17:35] ABBs [17:36] talking about raising equity, uh, we haven't had a an ABB for a while or a [17:41] book build. Um, are they still part of the playbook? Yeah, very much so. Everything that [17:46] we've done today and more will be part of the playback playbook in the future. Um, you know, it's August at the moment, [17:53] so it's not a great time to do an ABB. Um, you know, we've done a number of raises in August already. Um, so ATM [18:02] proceeds, the placing, the subscription that we talked about, smarter convert. So even though August is a quiet time, [18:09] uh, we've been quite encouraged by the number of meetings that we've been able to have um, virtual and in person. Um, I [18:16] don't know when we'll do another ABV. Um, might be August, might be September. [18:21] I I honestly couldn't tell you and and if I did know, I wouldn't be able to say anyway. Um, you know, I've been very um [18:30] excited over conversations that I've been having over the last couple of weeks with a massive American bank. Um,

**James:**
[18:36] I don't know whether that will be um like an ABAB style thing or whether it [18:42] be a placing um or or something else, a subscription. Uh so um that's quite [18:48] encouraging um as well. So yeah, all of the capital raising tools that we've used today are very much in place and [18:55] it's my job to um specifically on the placings and the subscriptions and the AB side of things to think about what [19:03] that flow of investors look like and then to think about how I want to do it, how I want to structure it, whether I [19:09] want to bundle people together um and so on and so forth. [19:14] And how are conversations going with UK institutions or is it still mostly kind of global? No, actually I'd probably say [19:15] UK Institutions [19:22] that I've had more meetings with UK institutions than global institutions um recently, which is quite encouraging. [19:29] Um a lot of them are sort of, you know, quite early on in the decision- making [19:35] process in terms of whether or not they want to get involved in this space. They're thinking about which company [19:40] they would want to, you know, support. Most of them don't want to support numerous companies. Um so I think that's [19:48] quite good. Um, one of the meetings that I had yesterday, um, was with an analyst and two fund managers, a micro cap fund [19:55] manager and then the next size up. Um, you know, we're not so much in that micro cap space anymore. Um, but but the [20:03] the the discussions that we've had with those people feed into other people in their organizations.

**Andrew Webley:**
[20:08] Um, so yeah, it's it's probably the first time actually the last few weeks [20:14] when I can say that I'm having more conversations with institutions in the UK than than than overseas. Um, overseas [20:22] is still mega important to us though because particularly take America, you know, there's so much more capital [20:27] there. Um, so, you know, it's really important to us. Um, but yeah, we're [20:33] trying to get the UK institutions on board um, slowly but surely. an Abu Dhabi. [20:41] Yeah, that was good actually. Um, yeah, really good. They're massive as well. Um, obviously I haven't disclosed who it [20:48] was with, so he would probably probably leave that one there. Okay. [20:53] Um, when will SWC be listed on the NASDAQ? Are there any such plans? [20:55] Dual Listing [21:00] There's no concrete plans for that. Um, I'm very proud that we're a British company. Um, you know, we're we're [21:08] listed in the UK. We're, you know, the company's a UK company. You know, um, [21:15] you know, most of the team are from the UK, live in the UK. Um, I think maybe [21:21] longer term we might um, look at a dual listing at something like the NASDAQ. It's probably a step up from the OTC. [21:28] Um, it's certainly not going to be a 2025 job. Um, I think we'd we'd have to [21:34] be very careful about how we position ourselves globally if we did do a dual listing or however it was structured.

**James:**
[21:40] Um, because I'd want to be, you know, shouting sort of loud and proud about the UK and I wouldn't want to lose, you [21:47] know, that that side of things. Um, it might make it a bit easier to get some [21:52] of that um, you know, institutional capital from certain funds in in the US. [21:58] Um although to be fair um the discussions that I'm having at the moment you know they're you know quite [22:05] to the surprise of our UK advisers they're actually perfectly comfortable with investing in Aquis in the UK [22:12] because they can see what we're doing as a business. Um and then of course you know we've got other plans of you know [22:18] where we may be listed in the not too distant future in the UK too [22:24] potentially. Okay. Okay. I mean, that kind of is [22:25] Acquisitions [22:29] about what I'm gonna get on that, isn't it? Yeah, we should probably move on. Actually, I probably should have digressed, [22:34] right? Um, moving on then. Um, acquisitions. Um, two two questions. Can [22:41] can we get into the nitty-gritty of of acquisitions? And the other being, um, would you consider buying another [22:46] treasury if they're trading below NAV? Yes. So, I had a long conversation with somebody about that last point [22:53] yesterday. Um, so we'll cover that one, but first let's talk about the core operating business and the acquisition [22:59] strategy. Um, so as I put out on X earlier today, I've spent the morning u

**Andrew Webley:**
[23:05] doing four interviews. Um, 8, 9, 10, and 11. I almost was late to meet you today [23:11] because the last one overran. Um, so that's really important because we want [23:17] to grow the operating business. Um, you know, as everyone said, sometimes positively, sometimes negatively. Um, [23:24] the way I've described it is it's been moderately successful for 15 years. It's been profitable. Um, but the most [23:30] important thing is that there is quite easy growth potential there. Um, so I'm pleased with how it's going at the [23:36] moment and I've got a very robust plan of how I'm going to ramp that up hopefully fairly quickly. Um, so that's [23:42] the operating business, the acquisition strategy. Um, so full transparency [23:47] that's changed quite a bit since we listed. you know, I had a conversation with a good company that I was [23:54] considering uh looking at very very informal discussion just trying to find out whether it would work right at the [24:00] start of of listing. Um that company wouldn't be appropriate to acquire anymore because it would be too small. [24:07] Um it wouldn't be worth doing. Um so um so the acquisition strategy has has [24:14] broadened um since then. Conceptually, it's still the same. So if you think that Bitcoin, you know, in our opinion [24:20] is likely to do 30% every year forever, sometimes less, sometimes more, but you know, on average, that's that's the [24:26] figure that we use internally. Um, you know, you wouldn't want to buy a business that isn't going to pay you back in, you know, much more than three [24:33] years. Um, and also as per our operating business, you want something that's low

**James:**
[24:39] risk. Um, so you don't want to have something that's going to create a problem for you. So you basically want something that is low risk, that's going [24:45] to throw off cash. um and um and then and then you can look at that. So, we've [24:51] got some things that we're doing internally that I'll be able to share in in due course about how we're going to [24:57] um try and speed that side of things up. Um but we'll only ever do that when it's right for the business. Um you know, so [25:04] if it doesn't happen for years, that's because we're trying our best and and we can't find anything that we can [25:09] structure in a way that we believe will be beneficial to our shareholders. Um, but clearly if you can do what I've [25:17] talked about there, then it's incredibly beneficial for the shareholders because after three years or or thereabouts, [25:23] you're just creating cash that you can use for your treasury to grow your balance sheet further to repeat that [25:28] process time and time again. Um, that's the key thing um that people are starting to understand by having a a [25:35] very good treasury policy that you can have a very strong balance sheet and that gives you options as a business. Um [25:43] so so so yeah we're doing a lot on all of those different fronts. Um you know [25:48] most of it we don't don't or can't talk about in any more detail. Um but the the [25:54] strategy as per what we listed with in the admission document you know is is is [25:59] broadly the same as it was. It's just a little bit bigger now. [26:05] Targets

**Andrew Webley:**
[26:05] Thank you. Um I heard you talking on Tim Cutsman's [26:10] live stream. Um, and he kind of uh mentioned some some nearer-term targets. [26:16] Um, but it was asked and uh I think people would like to have maybe like an end of year guesstimate um as to where [26:25] we might be going. Yeah. So again being completely honest with you, I kind of regret saying that [26:31] because it's very difficult to put a number on it at the end of the year. Um, so I could put a number on it like I [26:38] did, um, as my opinion of where we may get to. Um, but one thing could change [26:46] that. So, one of the conversations that I'm having at the moment would blow it out of the water. Um, you know, so it's [26:53] quite hard to do that. Um, so I think and I've been thinking about this a lot [26:59] since since Tim's event. Um, maybe the sensible thing to do is just to have a a [27:05] meaningful target which is basically double the previous target. So if if that's what we decide on. The current [27:12] target is 4,200 Bitcoin, not at the end of the year, hopefully way before the [27:17] end of the year. Um, and then 8,400 and so forth. Tim made a very good point [27:22] that strategy never has a target. You know, their their mission, which is the same thing that I've always said, is to [27:29] buy as much Bitcoin forever. Um, so I I [27:35] don't know the answer. Um, and we need to debate it more internally. Um, maybe

**James:**
[27:40] we'll have some sort of a target. Um, you know, I I yeah, I don't really know [27:46] if I'm honest about that side of things. um you know as long as I can believe that I'm trying to do better every [27:53] single week um and making you know progress and demonstrating the progress [27:58] to the shareholders then I think that that's probably quite um quite [28:04] important. Um you don't want to do too much backward-looking stuff. Um but if you compare say our 30-day yield um you [28:12] know it's pretty healthy still. It's not quite 100% but it's still healthy. Um, you know, and as you get bigger, you [28:18] know, it it it's particularly in a quiet month like August, you know, that that is going to, you know, effectively slow [28:24] down a little bit. Um, but it will still be, you know, very very, you know, [28:30] impressive in in my opinion. Yeah, I think you still bought uh more [28:35] Michael Sailor [28:37] Bitcoin than strategy this week, didn't he? Yeah, because we love Michael Sailor, we [28:43] wouldn't want to talk about that because, you know, like every single week he buys more than us. So, we did it [28:49] one week out of, you know, you know, he's got a lot more capital at his disposal than us. And, you know, the [28:56] guy's a legend. So, um, you know, we wouldn't want to say that, but yeah, it was quite cool, wasn't it? [29:02] Yeah, I think that's what I was trying to say. Um,

**Andrew Webley:**
[29:08] are you thinking about employing uh an investor relations individual to help [29:14] optimize your time? Um, so we've got an executive assistant [29:19] that's starting um in the early part of September and that will be tremendously [29:25] helpful. Um, because that will enable me to shave hopefully a couple of hours out [29:31] of my day and then do other things that people think that I do. um as opposed to [29:36] some of the things that people probably don't realize that I have to do, which is, you know, planning travel, managing [29:42] my diary, setting up live streams, you know, all all the the sort of the things [29:47] that people probably just think that happen. Um so that'll be great. Um I'm [29:53] very much looking forward to that and that will also assist with some other people in the team. Um you know, to [29:58] allow them to shave a bit of time out of their day and do more of the things that, you know, can really help drive us [30:03] forward. Um, I work very closely with Jesse and you know, we get on really [30:09] well and I'm so pleased that he's so happy in our company. Um, he um he's [30:17] been tremendously helpful on that side of things and I would think that with the uh recruitment of the EA and what [30:25] Jesse and I do, I think that we'll probably be okay on that side of things in the shorter term. um the marketing [30:32] manager that we're getting on board um hopefully fairly soon. Um they're obviously going to do a lot of the stuff

**James:**
[30:38] on the operating business, but some of the role is the PLC responsibilities. So that will complement the work that Jesse [30:45] and I do on that as well. Um so I I think we've got roughly the right sort [30:51] of team structure almost in place for that side of things. Um, but like [30:56] everything, you know, we we we you know, constantly review that to see how we can make that better. Um, we've got another [31:02] new hire that um, you know, be able to talk about in the not too distant future, which is really really good. Um, [31:10] and there's a bit of overlap there as well. So, um, so yeah, I think I think I think the plan that we've got at the [31:16] moment is is good. Um, but you know, I look at everything all of the time. you know, I constantly question what we've [31:22] done, what we're doing, and how we can make it better, you know, faster, you know, bigger. Um, and and and yeah, I [31:30] I'll keep looking at it. One thing that we've never done as a company is we've never employed a PR agency. Um, I don't [31:37] think we'll change that either. Um, you know, I think it's just a cost. I think we can do a lot of that with with the [31:44] people internally and then you know it's people who are very passionate about it that that that you know it's not just a [31:51] client. Um but yeah I I I'll look at it. I did see um the question online about [31:59] that thing and and I I think that's what I'd say to that question at the moment. [32:04] Um are SWC going to adopt quarterly results more like the US? um uh and [32:05] Quarterly Results

**Andrew Webley:**
[32:11] market updates, earning calls, that kind of thing. Uh or is the next update kind of year end? [32:17] Yeah. So that is um largely derived from the system that we've got in the UK, [32:22] which is by annual reporting. Um so you do your half years and then you do your annual um you I don't think we'll change [32:30] that in um up until the next um period which will probably come out February or [32:36] March next year. So the period end is October. Um, and that's when we'll do our AGM as well, which we'll try and [32:42] make into a good event for everyone. Um, most likely anyway. Um, so I think [32:48] probably after we get to that point, then we could do sort of a trading update in those, you know, two gaps, you [32:54] know, to make it effectively a quarterly update. Um, I think I'll speak to, um, [32:59] the team about that and and see whether we can do that from a regulatory point of view and also an operating point of [33:05] view. Um, so yeah, it's a good suggestion, but the reason why we do [33:11] bianual updates in the UK is that's what the system is. Um, and just going back to kind of [33:15] Marketing Plans [33:17] marketing, um, what future marketing plans do SWC have to get into more [33:24] mainstream media, FT, Investors Chronicle, Money Week, etc. [33:31] Yeah. So, I was reading the Times this morning. Um, so I do read some of the mainstream media. Um, and I was really

**James:**
[33:39] disappointed actually. Um, it's one of the lead stories on the business section today where they've got, um, a bit of PR [33:45] that's obviously come out of Rolls-Royce saying how they are keen to become the [33:50] biggest company in the UK, which is where Astroenica are, which is basically them doubling. Um, and and I I was [33:58] reading it and I was thinking, you know, this is so disappointing that not once has the Times written an article about [34:04] the smarter web company, as far as I'm aware anyway. Um, and you know, we have been pretty successful in the UK. We [34:10] have been doing something positive for the capital markets in the UK. Um, and [34:16] you know, we are, you know, a pretty well performing equity on the global stage at the moment. So, I think the [34:23] only thing that I can do to change that is what I've built into the role uh for [34:29] myself, Jesse, the executive assistant, and the marketing manager, which is to [34:35] more proactively reach out to these people um and try and get them interested in what we're doing and to [34:41] understand that, you know, we're we're building something that we we believe will be one of the biggest companies in the UK. um and to try and get that sort [34:48] of coverage, but not just on the print side of things or what what's now online, but also on the video side of [34:54] things. Um so, um you know, I remember when I did that CNBC interview um and [35:01] and I'd like to do more like that. Um so, we have had some of those people um [35:08] when I was in Abu Dhabi actually, I had a message from Bloomberg um starting to get interested in what we're doing. Um,

**Andrew Webley:**
[35:15] so I I think it's just a case of making sure that we get out there and we tell all these people as much as as much as [35:20] we can what we're doing and and try and get their interest so that they will write um stories about us specifically [35:26] on the FT. Um the last thing that I saw them publish was almost positive about [35:32] Bitcoin Treasury companies. Um so you know maybe the tide's turning there as well. Um, so we'll just we'll just keep, [35:40] you know, trying to sort of get the message out there and and hopefully, you know, they'll they'll start to cover us [35:46] a little bit more because I think it'd be really beneficial. Um, not just for the company, but also for the people that then find out about us. [35:54] And then, uh, fun question, what's your preferred meme? Is it, uh, we're doing [36:00] okay or, um, they're not laughing now? I like them both. Um, [36:08] I like them both. I think they're doing okay is quite good. Um, I think the they're not laughing now is quite an [36:15] underused one. Um, you know, because if you cast your mind back to when we listed, you know, no one was really that [36:23] interested in in the UK. people globally were interested of course but um not the [36:28] retail investors here but the institutions um and and now it's quite funny when we [36:33] go and see them all because you know they can see that we're doing something that's really really positive and it's [36:38] even though it's only been three and a half months is starting to become a bit more mature. Um so if I had to pick one [36:46] at the moment I'd probably say they're not laughing now. Um,

**James:**
[36:50] Looking Forward [36:53] and did you, this is kind of an open question. Did you have any other stuff that you wanted to talk about today, [36:59] bring up uh, looking forward, looking back? I don't know. [37:04] Um, yeah, it's a good question that one. Um, [37:10] I think I'd just like to sort of say to people how I feel about the company [37:16] because, you know, we're all individual people and we've all got our own perception of things at any point in [37:22] time. Um, but I look at the company right now and appreciate that I'm the [37:27] CEO, so I've got, you know, complete visibility over everything that we're doing. Um, and I couldn't be more [37:34] excited and I'm not I'm working harder than I've ever worked um at the moment. [37:39] Um, it's amazing. Um, I feel that we're way stronger than we were a month ago. [37:46] Um, and um, and I'm very excited about, you know, what we're doing at the moment [37:52] and what we'll be able to share with people, you know, in the coming sort of weeks on that on that. Um but but then [37:58] also as an investor um you know in Bitcoin for 10 years in equities for 25 [38:03] years um sometimes successfully sometimes not very successfully um you [38:08] know what we're seeing at the moment is just the same old thing that we see all the time you know things get a bit

**Andrew Webley:**
[38:14] quieter over the summer people don't take advantage share prices then bounce back start of September end of August [38:21] everyone says I wish that I bought a load then um so you know I I being the [38:27] CEO of a public company now and having the visibility that I've got and understanding how things move. Um you [38:34] know I've got complete compassion for people that might you know want to trade their shares right now. Um but for me as [38:42] a sort of a medium to long-term investor um you know I'm I'm I'm mega mega [38:47] bullish about everything right now. Um, I think the other thing that is worth remembering as well, because we're all [38:53] used to the Bitcoin cycles, but it appears from what we can see that the Bitcoin Treasury company cycles are like [39:00] everything else in Bitcoin Treasury land just just magnified. Um, so they're a lot shorter. Um, you know, you get the, [39:08] you know, what you would get in, you know, four years, you know, in four weeks or eight weeks or whatever it may [39:14] be. Um so that compression um is something that you know um you know [39:20] people need to be aware of and and you know what sailors always so said so well is that you know the volatility is the [39:27] thing that gives you the performance. Um so the volatility helps the company and the volatility gives the investor the [39:34] potential performance. Um so I think that's my observation of things at the [39:39] moment and you know it's not something that we talk about that much. Um but it's something that is quite an [39:45] interesting thing for everyone to think about. Um you know and and and

**James:**
[39:50] the caveat there is that there are no guarantees for the future for anything um particularly investing. Um but that's [39:57] my observation on on events right now. Well, thank you Andrew. We said I said [40:03] we'd keep this to 40 minutes uh so that you can get on with your day. Um really [40:08] appreciate you taking the time as always. Um, and I'm looking forward to the news that's coming out in the coming weeks. [40:14] Yeah, me too. Thanks, James.
