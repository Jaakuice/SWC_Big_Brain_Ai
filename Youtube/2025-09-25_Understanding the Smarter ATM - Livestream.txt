**[Intro Music: 00:00 - 05:06]**

**James:**
(0:05:06) Hello, hello, hello. Thank you for joining me, Co Cannon, and thank you everyone else who's watching. Um, whether that's live or recorded. Uh, let's just uh remove that for a sec. Okay, let's let's see each other properly. Um, thank you for for sparing the time to do this. Um, the ATM is a hot topic in pretty much any community that uh of a B BTCTC that's got one. Um, there's bearish views, there's bullish views. Um, but I think what I enjoy about the content that you've prepared for for today is that it's not kind of biased one way or another. It's just showing analytics uh to let people make their up their own minds and kind of see what they understand about it. So, you've been incredibly prepared and you've you've created a whole deck. Um, which is awesome. Do you want to dive in and then I'll just ask some questions as we go along?

**Conan Cannon:**
(0:06:08) Yeah. Yeah. I think we can uh start off with some of the INAB and BTC yield slides. Sure. So to bring that up. Yeah. So I think like one thing that's good to cover maybe before an ATM which gets like so contentious about like how much is it diluting and things just looking at like the relationship between MNAB and BTC yield. So like this is just

**James:**
[06:37] a simpler picture that I grabbed from like a MetPanet presentation. And so what it really tries to describe is pick [06:44] some random amount of coins to have in the future, 30,000 coins. and it doesn't have a date attached to it and it [06:51] doesn't tell you whether it's ATM or like book builds. You know, this could happen just through the book builds [06:56] alone and you'll still achieve these yields if you're at this MNAV. So, if we're at like three MNAV at starting at [07:04] some number of coins, you'll achieve like an 80% yield or something like that. And that's a SATS per share yield. [07:10] That's not um just the stack growing. So, I sort of made a different chart [07:16] just for SWC that shows the Bitcoin holdings. It's a little bit out of date. We start at [07:22] 2470, but it goes all the way out to 30,000 Bitcoin. And again, it doesn't have a date attached to it, but it shows [07:29] you if we were to stay at 1.5 MNAV for the entire time that we go achieve [07:35] 30,000 coins, you know, our yield would be in the range of like 40%. I I I have the Excel up too so I can share the [07:42] numbers. Um but I think just like a fundamental understanding of this is kind of the first step. So if we were at [07:49] six in nav, we would achieve yields of like 370%. Something like that. And if you get in [07:55] the middle at 4 in nav, it's somewhere in like the 200 range. But the important thing is like small increases in mnav [08:02] yield a big difference in BTC yield. And I have like other simulations that I've done um that might make more sense, but [08:10] uh this is like the foundational block to start. If you kind of don't understand this, the simulations aren't

**Conan Cannon:**
[08:15] going to make any sense. Um so I think we'll go down to maybe the description [08:23] of the simulations and then show like two different data points. Um, [08:30] so I tried to keep this simple and as like not technical, not code as possible. So I'm like simulating [08:37] Bitcoin. We have three different ways to get Bitcoin through the ATM cash secured [08:42] puts that I have like a certain amount of and preferred shares that you also see in the simulation. Um, MNAP swings [08:49] between some some two points. I don't know what INAP's going to be. I have like no idea. Um I'm just giving some [08:55] reasonable bounds like highs and lows that we've seen with other companies. Um [09:00] these are some formulas that people can kind of read later, but this is the same formula [09:06] uh expanded in different ways. So the big thing I would say is the stock price [09:11] is obviously correlated to MNAV. That's the thing that changes moment to moment in my mind. The Bitcoin price changes a [09:19] little bit less. So you know it's it's a little more stable nowadays. I think we've been at like 100K since like [09:24] January. So, um it it hasn't moved a whole bunch. And then Bitcoin holdings don't change moment to moment. That'll [09:30] come weeks at a time. And same with the shares. This this does change with the ATM like moment to moment, but it's [09:37] small amounts on a daily scale. On like a monthly scale, it's it's different obviously. [09:44] Um another piece I put into the simulations was, and I can show the data really quick that John Levy put

**James:**
[09:50] together. Um, so he has like different volume charts and what I noticed is when [09:56] we have a higher MNAV, we're getting higher volume and this is like a percentage of outstanding shares. So [10:01] like up to 3% of outstanding shares is pretty normal for a highnav scenario and [10:06] down at lower navs it's a lot less. Um, these are the ATM metrics that I put in. [10:12] So 20% dilution if price is higher at all. Um, and then MNAV has to be 1.1. If [10:19] it gets below, I just I don't dilute. Um, and we'll get to this later. I do a [10:24] lot of simulations with this the relationship between dilution and a theoretical price impact which is [10:31] expressed through innav. So if if we look at this formula, the shares aren't changing minuteto minute really not [10:39] significantly. The holdings aren't changing minute to minute and the Bitcoin price is going to wiggle by like [10:44] a percent or two intraday. it's not going to do crazy things every single day. Um, and then I have a prep launch [10:53] that's a hund00 million IPO and then it gets to $1 billion uh at the end of like [10:59] 2027. So if I go down just the base case, so so I just want to clarify what you [11:07] said there just to make sure I've understood it properly. Um what you're [11:12] saying is that uh there is potentially some impact to the share price by [11:19] running the ATM, but that it's relatively minimal. Mhm. Yeah, let's look at that. Let's

**Conan Cannon:**
[11:24] look at that. So this this is some data that Nither Dither on X put together and [11:29] it's not for smarter web company. Uh we don't have like super granular data. Um but he did it for metapan. So what he [11:36] did was he bought tickle level data um from I think like Edinet and everyone [11:41] can go buy the tickle level data if they want to do this on their own and go figure out what's going on. Um but he [11:47] did a really good presentation of the data showing like average prices and median prices. And so red is when the [11:54] ATM is operating. They they have a different ATM than we do. So things are going to be different. Um [12:02] either the companies running the ATM are different. Um but you know we can extrapolate and say we might have a [12:07] similar performance here. It's at least data. So so uh you know part of my background is like my first job um we [12:15] had this card full of values and stuff and 99% of them were just corporate but one of them stood out to me and it's [12:20] being data driven. So like if I make an assumption in the simulation I want real [12:27] world data to back that up. Okay. So in this case we can see the average price there's a delta of like 1% [12:36] maybe 2%. Um I think 2% is going like towards the high side. I think on like [12:41] the longer time frame you see 1% roughly. Um and that's theoretical. You [12:47] know SWC may operate their ATM differently so that they don't impact these prices. I think one other thing [12:53] this is this is harder data to look at. These charts are like way more confusing. Um, but if you look at the

**James:**
[12:59] top right one, what happens is when Bitcoin is up, EVO sells more. So that's [13:07] how a different company is operating their ATM. I don't know if we're operating our ATM that way. Um, we may [13:13] operate it more closely to the stock price than some other uh way to to [13:19] determine it. But so this is where I came up with the 1% impact to share [13:24] price and and therefore MNAV. If we go back to this formula, that's really the two things that are changing the most at [13:30] any point in time. These elements are changing less. Sure. Thank you very much. [13:35] Yep. So yeah, if we just break out the base case simulation, what I'm doing [13:41] here is kind of the most independent variable is MNAV. That's really like all [13:47] I could, you know, kind of put into the simulation to make the stock price [13:52] behave differently and to make the ATM operate differently. So, I have in my and this is a base case. This is like [13:58] meant to be kind of bearish. It's not like pie in the sky. I have a bull case. So, if people want to see big numbers, [14:04] they can see that. Um, but you know, it drops down to oneish. We've seen that in the in the Treasury market lately. We've [14:11] also seen numbers as high as five and four and three. I think those numbers will come back at a certain time. And [14:17] this simulation isn't saying like I mean yes I've I've overlapped it with kind of like the four-year cycle peak here but I [14:24] don't know when MNAV is going to come back. What I'm trying to say is in this

**Conan Cannon:**
[14:29] simulation innav will be at two for call it a couple of months right it'll be at [14:36] four for a very short period of time maybe then what is the impact on holdings and bitcoin per share like you [14:42] see you see a lot higher increases in bitcoin per share this this uh you see [14:49] this kind of parabolic rise effect when mnav is high when is low our bitcoin per share is a [14:56] lot more flat Yeah. So, so just to be clear to people trying to work this out and apologies that the [15:01] some of the writing is probably a bit small, especially if you're watching on a phone, but um what you're saying is [15:07] this isn't about predicting future prices of SWC. This is about p uh predicting future performance of SWC [15:14] with the ATM, I think. So, yes. Yes. It's saying what happens if you run a 20% ATM on this [15:22] MNAV curve. And I I have different innap curves with my bull and bear case, but [15:29] um that's what that's what I try to do here. Yeah. Try to be very realistic and say like we're going to have periods of like [15:34] heightened euphoria and then we're going to have like periods of pain and it's just going to happen this way. [15:40] Um you know, for Bitcoin, I I just kind of [15:47] have the price going up. If you if the thing is if Bitcoin's price goes down and IMNAV stays high, we're going to [15:54] accumulate like a lot of coins. Like that's that's the thing that I see happening is I don't see [16:01] where lots of treasury companies have high MNAVs and they're running ATMs really hard. I don't see where Bitcoin's

**James:**
[16:07] price goes down significantly. Um so that's kind of an assumption in this model. I have like more of a crash in [16:14] the other model. Um you can see like the daily trading volumes and stuff like [16:19] it's it's pretty correlated to IMNAV here. Um and I could show that data really quickly from John Levy. So this [16:27] is a highnav scenario when we were in June and you know the average is around [16:33] 78 million or so shares just on average. Um and in low nav it's more like a three [16:40] million shares. That's what we've seen through August and part of September. So, in this base case, I've got, you [16:48] know, down into the fours maybe with trading volume up into the tens hovering [16:54] around eight or so. So, that's kind of how it's behaving with the with the MNAV. [17:00] Sure. And they're getting higher because obviously there's more shares in it over time, right? Yep. You can see the in the bottom left [17:07] we have the shares outstanding growing kind of doubling by the end of 2027 [17:13] is what I have based on the ATM running when MNAB's above 1.1 and this MNAP [17:18] chart like if in that like if we were to go to the bull case just for a moment like we see 700 million shares [17:25] outstanding at the end of 2027 for a kind of bearish INAF case if we go to I [17:33] know the chart looks similar but this bottom bottom here is two. Okay. And it goes up to like five and seven is [17:39] the peak here. It hovers in the two to three range. The shares outstanding get

**Conan Cannon:**
[17:45] up to like 900 million. So we would have ATM out 200 million additional shares if [17:50] our MNA is going to stay high and if we're staying aggressive in the same way with the ATM. Okay. [17:56] And you can see the Bitcoin per share really rockets up uh at certain points. um this this bull case is is a larger [18:04] prep IPO. So that's why you see such a level shift and the the volatility goes up because [18:12] it's a billion dollar IPO. So that that would be like things go perfect. Um

**James:**
[18:22] yeah, it might be good since we were kind of I see some of the chat and like stuff about [18:28] this this relationship of like if this is the case I could also show a simulation of if this is not the case if [18:35] there's no reduction in MNAV but I think it's still useful like seeing like comparative levels. So what I have is I [18:42] have three charts. One where MNAB is reduced by 1%. That's kind of suggested by the nether dither data for other [18:48] companies, right? May not be true for SWC, but you can see an ATM of 20% in [18:54] blue significantly outpaces the 5% ATM. It the price is like double [19:00] by the end of 2027 and the trough. Okay. So, just just to [19:07] make sure everyone can can get their head around this, we're saying a in this model, and I know it's using assumptions [19:13] that have been drawn from other companies, but we're saying even though [19:19] a 20% uh ATM has a 1% effect on uh the [19:24] MNAV, it still outperforms because of the accretion of the Bitcoin that it [19:31] provides via the the shares being sold. Exactly. Exactly. And and one way to see that is if you have these ATM of 5%, [19:39] 10%, 20%. Here's what the holdings looks like over time. [19:44] Wow. So the here's where here's where I'm going to go back to the simulation, which I know is a lot to look at. I'm [19:51] going to go back to it for just a moment. Yeah. Because you see multiple graphs at once. So the Bitcoin per share goes up

**Conan Cannon:**
[19:58] significantly when INAB is high. Yeah. This is only true when you have an [20:03] ATM. Okay? If you don't have an ATM, like I don't want to like name names and like, you [20:09] know, shame some companies, but like if you're a company that doesn't operate with an ATM and you get to like a three [20:15] or five MNAV and you just sit on your hands and you wait and you don't lever up, you don't do anything, then your [20:20] share price is going to come back down when MNAV goes away. I mean, I think we've kind of figured out in this little [20:26] bare market like MNAVs are not going to be 10 for three years straight. I I don't see that happening. Um so I MNAB [20:33] will come back down with cycles and so the question is are you actively pulling [20:40] the value of that moment? Are you capitalizing? Are you seizing the moment to actually convert MNAV into equity [20:48] value? That's the biggest question. So when I go back to this Bitcoin holdings [20:53] chart, you see the the ramp up of the 20% ATM is drastically different. But [20:59] these simulations all have the same MNAV. This company in yellow had the [21:06] same MNAV as the company in blue. They just sat on their hands. That's the difference [21:12] in my that's what I would describe an ETM of 5% as being it's kind of sitting on your hands. [21:18] That's that's quite a difference, you know. Yeah. Um so [21:27] your assumption takes into account that there's a launch of prefs at some point. Um

**James:**
[21:33] there's a launch of cash secured puts at some point. [21:38] Um um in that model okay you've got that kicking in uh [21:44] January 2027. Yep. Uh, I tried to put it close to the 10,000 [21:51] Bitcoin mark. I had to play with this date a little bit. Um, you know, I think that's really [21:56] subjective whether it's like 10 or 20 or 30,000 uh, Bitcoin. Um, but this would [22:02] be like a hundred million IPO. Okay. Where, you know, in January we're at a [22:08] trough. We're at like 5 million or five USD with about 450 million shares. So, let [22:17] me calculate the market cap of that.

**Conan Cannon:**
[22:25] Well, it'd be it'd be in the billions. It'd be somewhere in the billions. Um, [22:31] yeah. So a hundred million dollar prep IPO when you're sitting at like five billion in market cap is is probably [22:37] pretty sensible. Sure. Um and that's why the the bull case I [22:42] have of being bigger just just this is like this is like the case of like everything goes perfect. [22:48] This is like we we just get so much Bitcoin that we're like let's just launch this prep. The prep gets soaked [22:54] up in the market. People buy a billion dollars worth of it. We eventually sell10 billion dollars worth of it. you [22:59] know, very successful perhaps. Um, the share price like 2026 is like a blip [23:06] compared to 2027 because MNAV is high. If MNAV is above two, [23:12] the holdings are getting to like above 100,000. Wow. And again, we're at a higher MNAV. So, [23:19] we're accreing better. If I go back to this chart, the higher the MNAV we have, [23:27] the higher the yield we get because we're we're putting less shares into the [23:33] market to buy $1 million worth of Bitcoin, right? It's like how how many shares do you need to sell to achieve 1 [23:39] million in Bitcoin? Like the higher the MNAV, the better deal the equity holder is getting, the current holder. [23:49] So that's kind of how I wrap my head around these things. So yeah. Okay. Um let's just see for a [23:58] second. Has anyone in the chat got any questions?

**James:**
[24:05] How likely is the press ser scenario you just mentioned? I don't know. James, where was your head [24:11] at on preps on like a a dollar figure and like a timeline? [24:16] Okay. So, someone's actually asked how how likely is this prep scenario you just mentioned. Um, so [24:24] in my head, Andrew has said they want to be 10 times bigger. So, I don't know when we reach that. Um, [24:33] I don't know. You've got two options there. You've got January 27 and what's your bull case? Yeah, the bull case would be mid next [24:39] year, like June. Okay. So, [24:45] okay. I'm going to try and just piece together information that we don't even know whether it's fact or not, but um [24:51] all speculation. Yes, entirely speculation. But assuming there's an LSE up listing this year, um [25:00] that that the interview that Jesse and uh Andrew did with Anders uh last night, [25:07] they kind of implied that there were checks waiting for equity raises upon [25:13] entering the LSE. So that and and and and sizable ones at [25:19] that. So you know I think that would accelerate us to say 10,000 coins not in that [25:27] moment but would would start us heavily on that journey. [25:33] there's a strong possibility, you know, if we get the extended cycle um and all that kind of stuff that or and no or [25:40] maybe there's a correction, but it's a shortterm, I don't know, 30% correction and then we grind up again. I'm talking

**Conan Cannon:**
[25:47] about Bitcoin. Um that yeah, somewhere between June next [25:53] year and and uh January 2027 sounds reasonable. um that's not [26:00] allowing for, you know, Bitcoin tanking and going into a full bear. Um [26:07] so timeline, yeah, I can I can kind of run with that. Um [26:13] the size of the prep deal. Uh let's have a think. Your base case is [26:19] $100 million and your bull case was a billion, right? Yeah. Yeah. Uh, [26:26] everyone's going to call me a bear for this, but um I think I think a billion might be a bit optimistic. [26:31] Oh yeah, for sure. you know, if if if Bitcoin [26:37] is a I don't know, 170,000 um and [26:45] uh we've got a stack of 20,000 [26:51] that would be putting about 50% of our stack into into press and having found a [26:57] buyer for for all of that um on day one. You know, sailor's pref launches I don't [27:04] think were that successful. Um, well, no, no, as in they were that successful, but look how much bigger they are. [27:12] Hello. Yeah, sorry. I guess my my camera just died. Um, so we're just Okay. [27:18] Um, yeah, I I mean I agree with you there. So, I've done a lot of looking into like what MSTR launched with their

**James:**
[27:25] preps and I mean each of them were above a billion and they've made like roughly [27:30] 7 billion off them. Yeah. So, they based on their Bitcoin nav they achieved about 10% of their Bitcoin nav. [27:39] Okay. But they have a much larger Bitcoin nav and and they do have a larger stack. Um I try to wrap my head around that. There [27:46] there's definitely the the BTC rating element. Um, [27:51] but I also there's just kind of demand out there in some regards. [27:58] I mean, if if if equity raises, you know, standard equity raises have got to [28:04] the point of, I don't know, $500 million or or or that kind of region. Um, then [28:12] or or maybe even a billion dollars by that point. You know, um, Metal Planet just did 1.4 billion. um then [28:21] you know actually selling a billion dollars of a 10% preference share in the [28:27] UK um doesn't sound completely mad um [28:34] now that we're actually kind of working through the numbers. Yep. And and keep in mind this billion [28:39] in my base case hund00 million IPO but a billion sold by the end of 2027. [28:47] Think about it. It's like January 2028. This is like it's like two and a change [28:52] years away. Like things might get credit ratings by then. Like that's you know [28:57] that's a that's a bullish case on it that it'll get credit ratings in the next two years but you know I I think

**Conan Cannon:**
[29:04] the the world might adopt in that speed. Okay. We'll take time but we're talking years. [29:11] Is this kind of I know this is a bit off topic but is this um kind of on the [29:17] basis that you know strategic reserves start moving ahead and and that kind of stuff. [29:22] No. Yeah. No. In my base case this is like we just kind of chop and grind. Like we have a lot of pain with him. [29:29] There's a like there's people that buy at 15 and come back down to five in this case, right? That's a lot of pain. um I [29:37] would say and and very moderate strength on Bitcoin price like it just follows [29:42] the power law. It doesn't even um go super parabolic. You know, I I think if [29:48] like if you have the case of like the US government dumping gold to buy Bitcoin, [29:54] I think the price is going to be beyond 200K. Okay, that's just a total guess. But, you [30:01] know, if they're going to throw a trillion dollars into the into the Bitcoin market, it's going to move the market. [30:06] Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Okay. So, what we're saying is your assumptions are [30:13] within the realms of possibility. Um, you know, they are still assumptions [30:19] and models are models, right? But, um, this will be wrong. This model will be wrong for a lot of different reasons and [30:25] I don't know what they are yet. Yeah. Yeah. And and that's modeling, right? Um, I don't know if anyone wants [30:31] to throw up any questions in the chat if uh if if they've got anything specific they want to ask, but we'll carry on

**James:**
[30:37] talking for a bit um to work pe work out if people have got anything. Um, [30:44] okay. Let's go. Yeah, let's go back to that chart with the the the 20% 10% 5%. [30:49] Yeah. So, this is by 1%. I it would be it would be hard um to do it live, but I [30:56] might be able to do like a 0% like just like let it not be reduced. But this is a this is a very small impact and and [31:04] really I think it paints the picture well enough with the three charts that I have that you can extrapolate what zero might look like. So this is 1%. [31:12] This is 2%. And it's on the same like $25 scale. [31:18] Everything's USD denominated in all these simulations. Can we can we go back to the 1%? Um, [31:26] sorry. I'm just trying to digest the the the lines. So, what we're seeing is that initially [31:35] it doesn't they're very aligned. Yeah, it doesn't really make much of a difference. So, why why do they diverge? [31:42] [Music] Basically, because you're capitalizing [31:47] on the MNAV. Okay. You're allowing Bitcoin holdings to run with a low dilution amount [31:54] because in the simulation the MNAV is five, right? [32:00] So if you accrete for a period where MNAV is five, your floor price [32:06] is going to go higher and higher and higher. Okay. When you get back down to one MNAV. [32:12] Sure. So yeah, it kind of pushes it further and further apart as

**Conan Cannon:**
[32:19] Okay, I like to think about these things in terms of like floor prices. So really what this simulation is is like a floor [32:25] price model. I don't know what the peak is going to be or when it's going to come, but if we have two peaks in 2026 [32:35] through 2027, then our floor price might be $5. if we continue operating the ATM [32:41] and it works in this way and everything is smooth and maybe we have a prep [32:47] launch or maybe we don't um but it would be but all these lines would move together down if we don't launch press [32:53] okay and so you know the the the 20% ATM creates a higher floor price than than [33:01] the um 10 and five y Okay. [33:10] See, I threw it down. I think I think I'm trying to think back to the early days of the ATM for for the [33:17] Smarter Web, but the am the sheer amount of um pounds, dollars that that came in [33:24] in the in the first run of it when the MNAV was still really high was insane. [33:31] you know, it's only ticking along right now, but um assuming that that MNAVs expand again. [33:37] Yep. That's going to be some pretty serious uh Bitcoin on the balance sheet. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, to your point, [33:43] and I do have a chart of this, the historical MNAV. So, I think we started [33:51] our ATM basically at the bottom here. Okay, that's my understanding. And so like [33:57] like price and IMNAV did go up um and chop and go back up and then we had this

**James:**
[34:03] sectorwide compression. Um okay. Yeah. So yeah, when it was [34:11] operating at I don't know 567 MNAV Mhm. We were we brought in an in was it7 [34:20] million pounds in in like a week or something like that. Um was the first [34:28] tranch I can't remember now. It was it was a few months ago but um [34:33] you know that that was some pretty insane uh accretion back then. [34:38] Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. I guess I I didn't have I don't have the chart of the nav per share. Um, but you see it [34:45] dramatically rise even through this period. It really starts to level off down below like two and a half in nav. [34:53] Sure. What I've kind of noticed. Um, someone's asked in the chat, um, would [34:58] it be possible to get, uh, [35:03] a copy of the slides? Yeah, for sure. Yeah. Okay, cool. I'll find a way to share this out. [35:10] Um, yeah, we we'll we'll work that out. Um, was there anything else you wanted to [35:16] add about the ATM? I'm assuming you [35:21] personally you're bullish on it. Extremely. Yeah. And that's that's why I [35:27] wanted to show like these I think these charts are like the golden goose of the ATM in my mind. So, [35:36] not SWC, but a different company has seen potentially a 1% temporary decline

**Conan Cannon:**
[35:43] in price. Temporary um essentially when they run the ATM. So, if I'm if I model [35:50] that out and then I and then I say, well, let's double it to see what's the worst that can happen. [35:57] So early on maybe there's some underperformance like maybe extremely [36:03] subtle but by the end it still outperforms. Yeah. [36:08] And if I triple it from the baseline yes we see early days you know it's [36:15] reduced or whatever but months later it's already outperforming [36:21] and within two years it definitely outperforms. And if I run the simulation out to like 2030, um, it would [36:28] significantly outperform, which is another I know I had spoken about that. I tried not trying not to like make too [36:34] many swings at things that I don't know will happen in the future, but when I run these simulations for like all these [36:41] different companies out to like 2030, they accumulate way too much Bitcoin. [36:46] Like they're not going to accumulate all this Bitcoin. I I think I had Well, let's look at the bullcase. So [36:52] theoretically, Smarter Web would buy like 40,000 coins in a couple of months. [36:58] Like that's like some significant like OTC moving of coins. Like imagine if a [37:03] hundred companies were doing that, you know? Imagine if 50 companies or 10 companies were buying 40,000 coins in a [37:09] couple of months. Like the price is not going to be that low. So when I simulate this out to 2030 and 2040,

**James:**
[37:17] um you know, just the whole simulation breaks down. Yeah. Okay. and and I'm guessing [37:22] companies end up owning more than 21 million coins and Yes. Yeah. [37:28] Um so the price is gonna run. Sure. So, so I think it's important for [37:33] people to understand again, I know we said this already, but that you know models are models and you know [37:41] it's not about predicting future share price or future Bitcoin price or anything like that, but it is about [37:46] showing the difference in performance um with an ATM and without an ATM. Um [37:53] and I think that's pretty clear to see. Um I'd love I'd love to see a screenshot of the 2030 version. Um [38:00] yeah. Yeah. I'll run some of them. It's easy to It's just a setting I put in this thing. Even if it's uh nonsense, [38:08] it's it's still quite nice to I'll I'll do I'll do one slide with the base case [38:15] base case to 2030 and then I'll do [38:22] one with like 0% impact just so people can see that in the final [38:29] slides. Okay, cool. Well, thank you very much Kenan. um [38:36] you put in the hard yards so that we don't have to and I really appreciate that and hopefully uh you know people [38:42] are going to get get to grips with the ATM and and start loving as much as they should. [38:48] Um but you know you're at real corn cannon

**Conan Cannon:**
[38:54] on on X have got some questions for you. I hope you don't mind me volunteering [38:59] you or people can send them to me and um you know I will uh sort of ask on your [39:07] behalf. Certainly. Yeah. But thank you uh and thank you everyone [39:12] for joining and uh catch you all on the next live stream. Awesome. Thanks for hosting James. [39:19] No worries.
