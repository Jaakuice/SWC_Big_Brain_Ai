**Vostra:**
(0:00:00) Hello, hello, hello everyone. Back again. This is uh Vstra doing you your usual daily update. Little bit of the week as well. There's been so much action this week in SWC land. I'm sure you've uh you've had a a a great time. It's hot out there. It's um I can only think it's going to get hotter. If you're new to the channel, you have to subscribe. That's the that's the deal here. You get these updates, you've you've got to subscribe. So, 11th of July, share price. We do a little bit of share price action. MNAV, what's that saying? X commentary Q&A. There's just so much to cover. Only got 15 minutes. Let's go.

(0:01:00) Right. Today's share price action. Moving across to the Smarter Web Company plc close price on uh Aquis there. So we can see that the uh business has closed at £3 90 on um today's close price. So that's good. Some good action this week. What we normally then do is look at the overall picture on um a trading chart. So let's quickly flick across to that. Um, this is slightly delayed, so apologies, but um, you can see the trajectory is building nicely. Have a look at some of the other videos as well that we've done this week. Um, still learning to give this type of commentary, but I think that um, we're doing a pretty good job. Would you not say? Um, the 0.618 618 is usually the what they call the golden pocket line and we're well clear of that. The next line up is the 0.5. So what you see here on the Fibonacci is um typical resistance levels and and support and that's why I use it to just get a a very quick snapshot. um it might might it might not be completely um useful uh something that's so uh early stage still and you notice I say early stage because it is because it is but um I I think that um I think it m maps quite well um and until Mr. Microman or or somebody who's good at charts can tell me otherwise I'm I'm just going to continue as we go. So, we've got the 0.382 um as the next bar and that would be at £419. What tends to happen is when the uh share price um approaches these levels and crosses it, you you tend to get a spike through just like there was for example at the 0.5 level on the the 3.54 you see. Um so, bouncing through there quite nicely.

(0:03:00) Let's have a quick look across to the US chart while we're um at it and see what the action is there. You can see that they are hovering around the equivalent 0.618 um golden pocket level um over in in the US and that is at the $5.37 level um and it's trading just uh slightly below that according to this chart. So I can expect this um this activity to continue around the 0.618 618 level potentially just by by buy by through there and then lift off to the $6 and above. That's the way I would think this would be going. Um you never know. No financial advice. It's a volatile stock as I keep saying. So um there you go.

(0:04:00) Uh flick across to the uh Financial Model MNAV. Now we look at the share price and then we translate across into our financial model that we're running in the background. The purpose of the financial model is to just give us a little bit of a gauge of where things are going. Um, so we do that next. Um, I've already uh inputed or come on to that. That's um couple of comments I wanted to talk to you guys about. The share price is yeah there or there about 380. I've just put 7.1. Uh my model is showing me approximately the trading MNAP. You'll see that there's some blank columns here. This is because I'm expanding the model. Um, we have cache information and I was conscious to make this a little bit more granular and align it with the latest uh data that's coming out. But as a model, I think it still does its job and it helps me to track um of of course the uh activities that happen, the IPOs, the book wraps, the ATMs, the subscription. I'll do a quick run through actually of everything that happened this week because there was quite a lot. Um, and then that brings us up to this week.

(0:05:30) So, yeah, as I say, I I look at this to help me understand mainly this column, if I'm perfectly honest, is column U. And what that is showing me is the Bitcoin per share in effect. And that is what this game is all about. If you can keep increasing the bitcoins per share at a trajectory um and then you're you're you're diluting um at the same time that's called accretive dilution. So dilute us away. Um the other big component here is obviously the capital raises and we've had um a strate subscription this week. We had the announcement of the um ATM as well that happened earlier this week. So in total, you're talking this week already 33.2 million pounds. Is that it? Um and the the the beauty in the system is that there is an ATM running in the background with a further 14 million shares um being sold. So uh yeah, I've got this down on the model currently to finish by 5th of August. That's very very conservative. I think the the way things are going that that could be done probably by the end of the month um before the end of the month. So you can see how sandbag stuff is in here. And that would then take the business to over 2,000 bitcoins, 2,100 um that that is a uh a very high probability for July, I would say.

(0:07:00) Um so at those levels, I then check the MNAVs. I taper them down slightly as we go along in the journey because that's the I look at some of the work that we've done before. Check out the other videos. I follow that and then uh that gives me the uh potential share price um output here. And this again, I know we look at this on a daily basis and it's probably not the greatest idea if I'm honest because it's a volatile stock. We like the stock but it's a volatile stock. So things don't always go the way models show. But what this the purpose of this is to show the the flaws the level I guess in some ways the fair value. Um and it could trade above it could trade below. Um but that's where I then check the charts to see what's going on. Um what what else? I think that was all on on that side of things. So hope you're enjoying the commentary.

(0:08:00) Um, obviously we had a a brilliant week for the Bitcoin price and we start updating that here because that's the other variable in the in the whole game that makes the uh makes it all exciting really, right? God candles, new all-time highs, anything can happen. Um, brilliant. Great stuff, right? Cracking on share price X comments.

(0:08:30) Yeah, so Comments we'll go through a little bit of X because I I've got a few comments saying the X was good. Um, so let's do that. And then I wanted to actually, yes, let me just switch through because I snapshotted a few X comments. They were related to this ATM. Bitcoin Baddy Smarter Web still has over 30 million in cash. Now we're seeing the full power of the ATM model. As the share price climbs, capital raises scale with it. That means they can deploy more Bitcoin more often without waiting on big one-off deals. Raging bull market. That speed matters. They built the system to buy continuously. SWC Ragna, give Ragna a shout out. He is got some mega alpha out there in Bitcoin Treasury World. And uh yeah, Ragna, we've got to do a a live. Let's do something connect. SWC daily close was at £365 yesterday. Yeah. And so today's price is £384. Shard is able to hopefully sell the full 20% of the daily volume at these prices. Also happy to announce that Ragna Treasury is just added around3 pound shard is a win-win. More shard equals better entries for additions plus more cash for juicy bitcoin purchases. Spinning the flywheel. Less shard equals higher prices. Potential mnab expansion. Better exit opportunities where pair trading. Let's go, sir.

(0:10:30) Yes, this um Ragna knows what's going on because yeah, a few people call sort of message me and say, "Hey, what's going on with the share price? There's um all this Bitcoin being purchased." But Ragna summarizes it very well, right? It's all to do with the MNAV expansion and um contraction. So, uh in essence, you if you let the if you let the MNAV run, then yeah, your share price is going to be reflective of that. But you don't want to let it run too much because you want to buy Bitcoin. Buy Bitcoin, get cash, get cash, buy Bitcoin. You know what's happening to the Bitcoin price, right? You've been on had a front row seat on that. Um, so that's X in the couple of snapshots that I wanted to take.

(0:11:00) And then let's move into the community X. We've got you hopefully you all see the uh interview by Andrew and James earlier today. clarified a lot of things that were being discussed um also about the the UTXO involvement in another UK uh business um and Andrew's reaction to that all all uh viewable on the on this interview that so I'll let you click into that and uh I'll share a link as well on this page actually I for I've got to keep the keep my homework up right so this is uh you can get a direct link to the interview and and watch that there um the next. Yeah, like just on close, there's been a 50 million stock sold at 0.022. I think that everyone's just a bit beused by that. That was quite funny. Um, is that a technical glitch or what? I And I saw somebody check the shard, man, please. You went to the pub. It is Friday. It is hot. We've had a big week. Uh, anything can happen in SWC land, right? That's why it's uh for me it requires a 24-hour news channel. Um Andy Smith there saying that 50 million sell means we can run the ATM heavy today. Is that got anything to do with it? Look, there it is. You can see it just shy 50 million. Uh I I honestly I don't know what's going on there. I um is it a fat finger thing? Is it an actual 0.022P? I'm sure we'll find out. We will find out. And you know if this was live we would have gone live and shared that news. But there we go. That's that.

(0:12:30) So brilliant stuff. Keep the X comments coming through. quickly check if there's any anything else on the uh community side of the uh comments here that comes through on my channel. Thanks very much everybody for leaving um uh comments on the channel. These are coming through thick and fast. David Inc. TK first. Is that a question statement? Uh D. Oh, there you go. It would be great if you could actually do a tutorial on how to participate in the book. Um Dave Dave Dave in read uh go on to the interview that Andrew did today. He explains all of that. Um I'll share the link to the interview. She seems cheap cheap away like the last one they did. Just just buy just buy it in the B market like what buy the common stock. It doesn't matter what price it's going up forever. No financial advice. Remember this is all entertainment. John Mooney big big fan is rockets. Brilliant. Thanks a lot dude. when SWC to ripping up $50 your channel yieldings. I know this is like a niche niche. Yeah. Thanks for the love. Thanks for the videos, Wra out to the 200. I I Yeah, I could. Um let me let me try and look at that. A lot of people requesting updates to the model. Yeah. Andy Smith, uh great job reading people. I think yeah, it does help people out. It's small bits. Leave your comments. There's a lot more people viewing these things than leaving comments. Just say say hello. Say you're confused. Say you don't know what's going on. Say you don't know everything. Um and we'll try and help you out. I'll try and help you out. What what are your thoughts on cash is cuts coming. Is this to simulate more Hey, look. I mean, you're going to don't get me started on the on the government and uh and what they're doing and and and uh and tax and all that. Please pricey. We haven't got time with 13 minutes and and and and counting. So yeah, thanks very much for that comment, but maybe we'll do some more stuff on that later. Thanks very much everyone. That's all great stuff.

(0:14:00) Yeah, fantastic. As a round up, small summary, I think maybe let's just quickly do the smarter website, the announcement that has happened because I'm just again blown away by all the all the activity here. View all the announcements. Let's go. Cuz I uh um can't think of a better way to summarize the the actions of the week. I mean, look at that. 22.9 million ATM. That was start of the week, was it? Bitcoin purchases and the investor presentation. That's uh I've got a whole video on that as well on on this channel. Take a look at that. We do a page turn step by step. Um the uh the private subscription 10 10.3 million I think it was. uh the Bitcoin purchase this morning, the things are on fire, would you not say, when you look at it this way? I've never seen a company kind of a startup move so fast. And there's ATM uh shares being sold in the background and there's action with UTXO and there's action with the Fat Finger 50 million shares. What else do you want? Look, have a great weekend. Vostra signing off. Ciao.
