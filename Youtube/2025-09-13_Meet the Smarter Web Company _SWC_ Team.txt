**Peter Dwan:**
(0:00:02) Hello everyone and welcome back to the bull standard. My name is Peter Dwan. I also go by the Twitter handle BTC Bull Rider. And today I have with me Andrew and Jesse from the Smarter Web company. How are you guys?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:00:15) I'm good, thank you. How are you?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:00:17) Yeah, beautiful. Beautiful.

**Peter:**
(0:00:22) Um, so for those who don't know, Smarter Web is a UK-based Bitcoin treasury company, which also happens to be the most successful IPO in UK history. So, um, I guess why don't we just start by having a short intro for both you and um, and Jesse.

**Andrew:**
(0:00:36) Yeah, sure. No worries. So, my name is Andrew and I founded the Smarter Web Company. Um, we decided to list it on the market in the UK. Uh we listed in April 2025, so three and a half months ago approximately. Um you know, and it's gone quite quite well so far. Um and today we announced that we've got 1% of 1% of all of the Bitcoin, 2,100, with a reasonable amount of cash that will be deployed into Bitcoin in the very near future. Um there's a lot more that we could talk about, but that's a brief intro.

**Peter:**
(0:01:10) Very nice.

**Jesse:**
(0:01:12) Yeah. Yeah, Peter, today's a pretty fun day. um an auspicious day let's say for for the company because it's quite a big milestone um for our goal to become you know one of the biggest Bitcoin treasury companies in the world, one of the biggest holders of Bitcoin in the world and certainly the leading Bitcoin treasury company in the UK. We're already in that position but we intend to continue to be in that position and and grow into a you know a company that I think we can end up accumulating 210,000 Bitcoin um over the coming years. I think that's what's possible for the leading Bitcoin treasury company in the UK. And and Andrew, I've joined Andrew in this in this mission. Um I joined uh I started helping out about two months ago now. So I missed the the extremely wild first month, but I've I've been on uh along for the journey ever since. Um for people who who uh I guess as way of introduction for for for me um I've been in Bitcoin for quite some time and have been contributing um analysis and writing um first under the pseudonym of Croesus and then more publicly uh in the last few years. Um, and people may have seen my um my global asset landscape chart that that Saylor likes to use and and his valuation model is is built on on my valuation model as a starting point. Um and uh yeah, so I I helped helped contribute some of the the uh the intellectual basis for like the the strategy of wait a second there's all this capital in the world sitting in these buckets getting not great returns and we and strategy and Saylor realized you know we know that Bitcoin is going to be outperforming anything. Um, so how do we find that capital, reach it, create the products that appeal to that capital in the world and and route that capital into Bitcoin by way of a Bitcoin treasury company that that creates these products to to go meet capital where it's at. And uh so now I'm super excited to be a part of doing that in the UK with Smarter Web.

**Peter:**
(0:03:23) Beautiful. And uh Jesse is too humble to brag on himself, but he also happens to be ex Bain consultant and ex Stanford MBA. Uh so he is very very technically sound um from that perspective as well. So uh just to give you guys a little background in case the smarter web community doesn't know too much about me, um I also have a 14-year traditional finance experience. Uh I I won't go into the details of that but really I joined this space um yeah like about you know 10 months ago following uh MSTR and then saw an opportunity with MetaPlanet to copy the um the MSTR playbook and really since MSTR is called the 800 pound gorilla that is I don't think going to be surpassed because of just how far of a lead they have, really MetaPlanet has become the gold standard of all these new Bitcoin treasury companies in in the regards that they have a great CEO who's very strategic. Um they have Dylan who is a who's despite his young age has been in the Bitcoin space for a long time with a massive social media following and very technically sound and now they have a rabid uh community which I'm very pleased to be a part of. And so I say all that because I uh observe the very same kind of I call it the holy trinity of what makes a really good Bitcoin treasury company. So one as I mentioned is that strategic CEO who wants to be the main um player in their respective local market in the form of Andrew here and then also a very technically sound um Bitcoiner in the form of Jesse here. And then I've also observed that despite only being a publicly traded company for as Andrew said what, three and a half months, you guys have been able to build a community that's over three and a half thousand uh which is very commendable. Um so I think that um all three of these are very key um kind of categories to make a very uh very efficient Bitcoin treasury company. And so I want to start off with talking about the um the UK landscape and how it's actually similar to the Japanese landscape in regards to its Bitcoin regulation. So Andrew, why don't you start off there? Give us a little bit of an overview on how does the UK currently view uh Bitcoin.

**Andrew:**
(0:05:46) Yeah. So the UK's not been incredibly Bitcoin friendly for the last few years, I think, is probably the the the kindest way of putting it. it's been incredibly difficult to buy Bitcoin. You know, even even, you know, if you've just got a regular bank account, the banks are quite unfriendly towards it. Um, now, if we want to keep it positive, um, it's worth saying that since we've listed, um, the FCA, who's the regulator in in this country, has actually unbanned retail investors from having access to certain products. Um, specifically, not ETFs, but ETNs. they're coming very very soon in the UK, which is fantastic. A bit like they did in America 18 months ago. Um, so I think the the simplest way of saying it is that for a number of years, the UK's been incredibly unfriendly, but it's getting friendlier. So, you know, the trajectory is is heading in the right direction. Um, for me as the CEO of a Bitcoin treasury company, that's really important. Um because what it what it what it tells me is that you know if we follow the path that we've we've we've seen in the states where ETFs were actually a very positive thing for Bitcoin treasury companies because we are completely different to an ETF um then you know that's a very very positive sign and and also for for um the the wider market i.e. the citizens of a country, if if you if you um if you're told by the powers that be that something is okay, um then you believe that it's okay. So, a lot of the work that we do is on the educational piece, you know, trying to make Bitcoin more understood, um because we're a public company that's adopting it as our primary treasury asset. Um so if if if there's more stuff happening in the country where people are realizing that you know what we've known for you know you know in my case almost 10 years you know that it's the best asset in the world it's it's giving that validity to it um which is really really really positive. What we've also done as a company is when we decided to IPO because we're one of the few companies in the world that's actually IPOed with this strategy as opposed to pivoting to the strategy. Um, so we IPOed the business with this strategy. Um, and what we've done right from the outset before we IPOed is make sure that we've got all the governance or the regulatory controls in place. Um, so yes, we're bigger than when we started, but you know, those controls were in place from from day zero. Um and and I think that's given um you know the regulators some confidence um in the sense that we're doing something that's clearly defined and you know growing it in a responsible way um albeit a bit quicker than everyone's expected. Um you know we've tried to you know keep keep that at the forefront of all of our decisions. So so yes you know in summary it's not been a particularly friendly place for many years. Um, but it is getting better and hopefully it will continue on that trajectory.

**Jesse:**
(0:08:53) And and to add on to to that, you know, Andrew lays it out perfectly there that you do want to see that the regulatory climate is heading in the right direction, right? And and that's an important input to anyone who's evaluating this this company and and our strategy. Um, Peter, you you made a great point of when I was thinking about joining Andrew. Um, I started to see the same pattern recognition that you were talking about here of like, wait a second, this looks a lot like the setup from MetaPlanet 15 months ago. uh you know, in so many ways, not only Andrew and how he runs his business and and the skills that he's acquired by being an operator um and knowing his business inside and out the way that Simon did, but also in terms of the, you know, the setup in the UK versus in Japan for different reasons, but a similar theme of like in Japan, you know, they've they've faced hard economic times for some time and there's a huge debt burden. Uh and people had and and for for a particular reason of of tax advantages of holding um equities versus just holding Bitcoin, there is reason for investors to get exposure to Bitcoin via a public equity. Right. In the UK, there's similar sort of themes in this island nation that's, you know, has a proud heritage and has faced tough times economically in in recent decades. Um and there's a there's also tailwinds for um a company like this to deploy a strategy like this particularly that um retirement account capital in the UK hasn't had a way to access Bitcoin exposure in the UK. you can you can jump through hoops to get exposure to micro strategy. Um, but you know, a homegrown equity, there hasn't been anything like that. And that's part of what what Andrew saw the opportunity to do. Um, and that creates quite a bit of a tailwind, I think, where, you know, how else is two trillion pounds of retirement account capital going to get their exposure to Bitcoin when they've been wanting to and haven't been able to. So, I think that's, you know, part of the story here. Um, and and I think it sort of mirrors a lot of the setup that MetaPlanet has enjoyed over the last 15 months. And then just the execution too of what Andrew does week in and week out, executing. It sure sure reminds me of MetaPlanet, executing incrementally, doing nothing nothing too special day in and day out, but just blocking and tackling, getting done, and and growing that Bitcoin per share over time.

**Peter:**
(0:11:40) Yeah, I I um the only thing I would disagree on is it's, you know, when you say it's nothing special because, you know, the proof is in the pudding when you guys have uh only been publicly traded for three and a half months and has been the most successful uh UK IPO in history. And you know, UK has a long illustrious financial history to begin with. Um, so Andrew, I want to talk about uh what you mentioned just earlier about how you launched with uh the idea of being a Bitcoin treasury company, but yet at the same time you also have a web design component of this business. So can you tell us a little bit of how you think about that? Is this more of a hybrid, you know, how should investors like me think about this? This is a hybrid kind of business like similar to MSTR where they have that software component and the Bitcoin treasury component or is it more of a pure play like MetaPlanet which sure they have one hotel but they use that more as like marketing per se. Um so yeah how should we think about this?

**Andrew:**
(0:12:48) Yeah. So it's important to say that um if you want to do a strategy that that is similar to what we're doing you do need to be an operating business. um otherwise you're a fund and there's different regulations that you have to comply with. So you cannot do that. Um you know there there aren't any regulations out there actually that encompass a Bitcoin treasury company because it's a new thing right? Um so when I couldn't find a business that I wanted to invest in, a UK business, um I decided to list my business um which has been profitable for 15 years. It's a small business but you know 250 plus clients, 30% recurring revenue um you know growth potential etc etc um and you know the irony there is that the business that expired in uh strategy um you know is exactly that and by Michael Saylor's own words you know a failing technology company um I wouldn't describe my business as a failing web design company it's it's you know reasonably successful and it's actually a great service. Um but I think what people have to remember is that we've got three parts to the business. So we've got the web design business which is um self-sufficient. You know someone called Alex in the company who runs that side of the business. Um and then the middle bit is our medium to long-term acquisition strategy which you know we probably talk about at a later date. Um and then we've got the third bit which is our treasury management side of things which is um effectively taking the capital that the business needs for the future of the business and deploying that in a way that the business believes stores the value for the long term which is basically buying Bitcoin. Um so we've got three elements to the business. Now when I invest in a business you know inevitably I invest in a business for specific reasons. I don't invest in a business for its entirety. Um, so let's take McDonald's for example. You might buy McDonald's shares because you believe in their real estate side of their business. You know, you might buy a supermarket in the UK for their property portfolio. You know, you're not really buying it for hamburgers or selling, you know, cereal. You're you're buying it for elements of the business that you believe in. So, our investors, you know, some of them will have bought it because they like what we do on the web design side of things. Some of them may have bought it because they like the idea of what we could be in the future with a very very strong balance sheet um in terms of acquisitions and then a lot of people might have bought it because they like our beliefs in terms of how we hold our capital for the future. So all we're really doing as a business is we're trying to build a a very very large business. We want to be one of the biggest companies if not the biggest company in the UK. Um, we're already the biggest company in the UK holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Um, and we're we're building a business that's got a very strong balance sheet that's being run for the benefit of its shareholders with those three different elements to it. And in the future, there might be other elements perhaps, but obviously we've got our hands full with with what we've got on at the moment. So, so so, so that's very much in the future.

**Peter:**
(0:15:53) Got it. Thank you for that explanation. And just to give you guys some perspective um regarding the web design part of their business um according to uh one of your investor relations decks you have a 94% gross margin in 2024. So unlike Saylor's business which Saylor will be the first to admit you know it's a very competitive industry with probably low profitability, Andrew's web design business while small is very very profitable. So, I want to pivot into uh what you both of you mentioned earlier about how you guys are the leader in the Bitcoin treasury space within the UK and Jesse, I've heard you say this a couple times where you think each capital markets will have a winner takes most mentality. So, tell me about that. How do you um you know maintain this lead and grow this lead and what what does it take to be the winner in the UK Bitcoin Treasury space?**Jesse:**
(0:16:57) Yeah, and Andrew feel free to, you know, tack on to this, but um the way I view it is that um you know, what we've seen over the last few years is Strategy has has a leadership position in the US as a Bitcoin treasury company and is in many ways kind of becoming synonymous with how do you get exposure to a vehicle that is designed to compound your Bitcoin, right? That's the whole goal of Bitcoin yield. And yes, they deliver. First six months of the year, they delivered plus 20% Bitcoin yield per share um you know, Bitcoin per share and and that's fantastic. That's a a very attractive value proposition. They're the blue chip name in how you do that in the US. And now we've seen MetaPlanet emerge as, you know, that in Japan. That's the go-to name if you want to get exposure to a similar kind of piece of your portfolio, right? you want to include compounding Bitcoin, Bitcoin that's designed to grow by taking risk, by executing on a capital market plan. Um, you can compound that Bitcoin per share. And that's what MetaPlanet has been doing. Um, and so I, you know, I think you start to see a leadership role and like a narrative in each capital market of like what's the best way to get exposure to an asset that can compound my Bitcoin. In the US, it's Strategy. In Japan, retail investors and institutions will go to MetaPlanet. Um, and I think that's going to happen in every capital market in the world. And of course, the UK is a big capital market. It's not one of the biggest, but it's quite big. you know, there's a very material amount of wealth um over hundreds of years that that has been uh you know, accumulated in the UK and as we talked about there's not currently a good way to get exposure for a lot of the capital there to Bitcoin in general and certainly not to this idea of Bitcoin yield of compounding Bitcoin growth. So, I think that we will see in the UK, as with every capital market, a leadership name emerge where that's the trusted go-to place to take your risk exposure for how do you get not just Bitcoin exposure, but compounding Bitcoin? Um, and so I think that's like a human nature thing too, you know, that there's going to be a head and shoulders bigger than everybody else leader in that role. Um, and we want to be it. And, you know, I think we currently are that in the UK, we're emerging as that. But most people in the UK haven't heard of Smarter Web or Bitcoin Treasury companies in general. Um, and I think that will change as the mechanics continue to play out.

**Andrew:**
(0:19:47) Yes. It's really important as well to um to you know because I completely agree with everything that Jesse has just said but it's important to understand why the UK is not a great place at the moment in terms of capital market. So as you you know very politely um say you know we do have a good history um but as you also rightly say in recent years maybe the last decade or two not so good. Um, so take me personally, you know, I've invested in UK companies, but I've also invested a lot in US companies because the US capital markets is where it's at. That's where the good companies are. So, as being someone who's lived in the UK all my life, I wanted a UK company that we could be proud of, that my children could be proud of, you know. [20:36] Um, and I think the UK capital markets, if we get the right companies in the UK, [20:41] you know, being run well for the benefits of the shareholders, with integrity, with communication to the [20:47] people that ultimately own the companies, the shareholders, um, then I think you what you'll see is you'll see [20:53] less capital flowing out of the UK into these fantastic American or wherever companies because people do want to [21:00] invest. You know, we all live and in in different parts of the world and we like to buy local. We like to buy things that [21:07] come from our countries um you know wherever possible. The reason why we don't invest in the UK on the whole is [21:14] because the companies are crap. um you know and and and that's something that we're trying to change and it won't [21:20] change overnight but if we can have multiple good companies um you know in different sectors you know Bitcoin [21:26] treasury and other sectors you know whether it's technology pharmaceuticals you know whatever it doesn't matter um [21:33] you know that's that's a really exciting place you know because you know a bit like one of the caps says behind me you [21:38] know we want to make the UK great again um and and to do that we need to all [21:43] work hard and work together on growing really really good companies. Um, and Bitcoin is allowing us to do that. It's [21:49] allowing us to build this company on a, you know, a fantastic base. Um, and and [21:55] so far people seem to like that. Um, and and you can also see that from the international capital that comes in. You

**Peter:**
[22:02] know, there's a lot of institute of international investors that like the smarter web company, but as we've said [22:09] before, we are only just getting started. It's it's so early in the process. Yes, it's been a good couple of [22:14] months, but you know, I can think I can speak for Jesse and of course myself in saying that we're tremendously excited [22:20] for the next year, two years, five years, 10 years. Um, and we just can't wait to get going with it all. [22:27] Yeah. And you guys are off to a great start. Um, one thing that, uh, I learned [22:32] from you, Andrew, uh, you articulate so well with, uh, Jesse on the Preston [22:38] Pitch, I don't know if I'm pronouncing his last name correct, but Preston's podcast. [22:43] is um you mentioned that you have different investor bases um that you [22:51] have to kind of speak to and educate. So you know in my point of view because Wall Street is mostly not here um simply [22:59] because most of them don't understand Bitcoin and Bitcoin treasury companies is order of magnitude more complex than [23:05] just Bitcoin alone. Therefore, the majority of your initial shareholders [23:11] besides friends and families is existing Bitcoin treasury holders. Yet, at the same time, you have you will have to [23:18] persuade them to sell their existing MSTR and MetaPlanets to um buy your [23:23] position, right? And so, therefore, you have to have some sort of secret sauce um to to communicate your value [23:30] proposition. And I think you guys have done that well. But I really want to touch upon you know how do you plan to

**Andrew:**
[23:37] onboard the local institutions where you know you that's where the main capital [23:43] is right you guys said you know UK is sitting on $2 trillion worth of retirement funds in the retirement [23:48] system alone. So tell me about how you guys think about educating them. [23:54] So there's different ways that that you can do it you know. So, um, if somebody wants to know the secret of how you get [24:00] started with a Bitcoin treasury company, probably in any market, but it certainly was the way that we did it in the UK, [24:06] and and what you do is you just you you you do something that's very Bitcoin and you level the playing field. So, you let [24:13] everyone get involved. So, at the outset in our IPO, we let retail investors get [24:18] involved on the same terms as everyone else. Um, that's really, really important. Um, we actually allowed [24:24] retail investors to take part in every single raise until the regulations in the UK said that we couldn't allow [24:30] retail investors to put in any more money directly. They could then do it effectively through the ATM. Um, so [24:37] that's the first thing that you need to do. Um, the thing that you need to do after that is you just need to educate [24:44] people. So, you know, Jesse and myself, we spend a lot of time speaking to investors, explaining how the model [24:51] works. Um and and and you know it's as simple as that really. There's so many [24:56] different types of capital in the UK. So you'll get some investors that will want to um put something in with a slightly [25:04] different structure to to equity for example. So this week we came up with something called smarter convert um

**Peter:**
[25:11] which which which is effectively no downside for the investor. Um it's a an [25:17] equity raise at a premium for the company. um the there's no downside for the company either. Worst case scenario [25:23] is you give back 98% of the the Bitcoin effectively. Um so so you do things like [25:29] that as well. Um but but it is all about education at the end of the day what [25:34] what what we're doing. Um and you know it's it's you know it's it's it's quite [25:39] a fun job in in all fairness, you know. So we're speaking to a couple of the biggest investors in the world at the [25:45] moment. Um and it takes time you know we have to be transparent with people you know some of these institutions will [25:51] take days some of them will take weeks some of them will take months um to come up with the decision. It's a bit like if [25:56] you think back to yourself um or if I think back to myself when I first found out about Bitcoin when I first bought [26:03] Bitcoin and then when I first realized that Bitcoin was the best asset in the world. Um, and for me personally, there [26:09] was probably two years, maybe off the top of my head, between maybe three actually, between finding something, [26:16] buying something, and then being so convinced that it was the best thing in the world, you know, and and and whether [26:22] you're talking about an investor that's looking to invest a few thousand pounds in your company, you know, as a retail [26:28] investor, or you're talking to a an institutional investor who could invest tens of millions of pounds, it, you [26:34] know, they're all people at the end of the day. um and and and they take time with different processes of course

**Andrew:**
[26:40] because the big institutional investors have got very defined processes that they have to follow. Um but it's the [26:46] same thing at the end of the day. It's it's it's how long it takes someone to understand something and and at the end [26:52] of the day that's our job to help people understand what we're offering. No different to any public company really. [26:58] Got it. Let me sorry can I ask one question before we jump in Jesse? So um [27:04] when it comes to you know educating the institutions you know are they proactively coming to you or are you [27:12] cold reaching out to them or are using a third party to engage these institutions? [27:17] All three um so if I think about um the biggest conversations that we're having [27:22] at the moment one of them came to us um one of them uh came to us through our [27:30] broker. So our broker reached out to them um and then they wanted to see see us. Um so so it happens both ways [27:38] inbound and outbound. So we've got a really good relationship with a broker called Tennyson. [27:43] They've been fundamental to our success. Um really great team, a small team um [27:50] but really well connected in the UK capital markets. Um we're also having discussions with some very very big [27:57] banks in the US. um they came to us and we're speaking to them about how they [28:03] can then go out to their investors. Um Jesse's got a great network. I've got a [28:09] you know not as great network but an okay network. Um and um you know we

**Andrew:**
(0:28:14) speak to people but but none of it is you know hard selling. You know that's not what we're about as a company. We're just explaining what we do. If people want to support it great. If they don't that's fine as well you know. So, we're having lots of conversations with lots of different people on lots of different stages of their understanding of what we believe, which is a Bitcoin treasury company, is the very best investment in the world.

**Peter:**
(0:28:32) Got it.

**Jesse:**
(0:28:37) Yeah. Yeah. That Andrew nailed it there with um it's all about value at the end of the day. And we believe very strongly that Bitcoin treasury companies represent the best value. A well-run Bitcoin treasury company represents the best value in the public equity landscape at this point in time. Um, before we get into more of that topic, you mentioned um how do you convince a Strategy or MetaPlanet shareholder to, you know, perhaps reallocate some to smarter web? Um I want to start by re-emphasizing like I think Strategy and MetaPlanet are phenomenal value in the global equity landscape. That said, each of those three companies - Smarter Web and those two - are at different life cycle stages. I think Strategy obviously mature has you know lower growth. Um, MetaPlanet is in a transition period where they're still high growth, but they're kind of becoming a strategy-like company in Japan and Smarter Web is very much still in that high growth early stage that MetaPlanet was at a year ago, right? Um, and and I think that [29:52] those come with different risk profiles, right? Or or different volatility profiles certainly. Um, and and I think [29:59] that for a for a MetaPlanet investor, many of many of whom were originally [30:04] strategy investors exclusively, and then realized, wait a second, this is a higher growth version of strategy like [30:10] you, Peter, I think. Yeah, definitely. And that became compelling, right, as you thought through the mechanics there [30:16] of like, wait a second, I can be part of a a higher growth version of strategy. [30:21] Um, and I think that's what smarter web is to Metaplanet at this point in time. I think you know that MetaPlanet has [30:28] reached a different life cycle stage smarter web is where Metaplanet was a year ago and and I think we've seen what [30:35] happened over that year. It's the best performing equity in in the world in 2024. [30:40] Um, so I think that's, you know, the the narrative I would encourage people to consider at least of of the mechanics [30:46] and the math of of do you want to be holding the the the stock of a company [30:52] that has already purchased a ton of Bitcoin or do you want to hold the stock of a company that's rapidly purchasing [30:58] Bitcoin? Um, and you know, those are slightly different things to consider. Um, yeah, it and then we can sort of [31:05] turn back to like value in general. I think that Bitcoin treasury companies in [31:10] the global investable landscape in the in the equities landscape are more

**Peter:**
[31:16] compelling than anything else out there because to date I think that you you you said it very well that [31:23] it's perhaps 10 times harder to understand a Bitcoin treasury company than to just understand Bitcoin and we [31:28] know how hard that is already. So few people have really wrapped their heads around Bitcoin. Um, [31:35] compound interest is is difficult for people to wrap their heads around. Um, you know, we know that it's the famous [31:42] Einstein quote that Andrew likes to use of uh it being the uh eighth wonder of [31:47] the world. Um and and yeah, and so you know, I think that for that reason [31:55] and and the sticker shock of having to pay a premium to Bitcoin in order to [32:00] purchase stock in a Bitcoin treasury company, yes, you pay it. you know, the MNAV is maybe it's two, maybe it's [32:07] three, maybe it's five, maybe it's 10. But based on the yield, Bitcoin yield [32:12] delivered over any unit of time and then projecting forward, you know, your expectations about what that Bitcoin [32:18] yield per unit of time going forward might look like. When you run those numbers, it's pretty incredible how [32:25] quickly shareholder value generation occurs in a Bitcoin treasury company [32:32] versus the the premium you have to pay. In my view, these things are massively underpriced. And it's I think just [32:39] because people don't understand the mechanics, haven't wrapped their heads around Bitcoin enough, and certainly [32:44] have like bit of sticker shock at the at the the reality that you have to pay a premium upfront in order to get in.

**Andrew:**
[32:52] Right. I I I want to touch more on that later, but just circling back to what you what you just touched upon in [32:59] regards to, you know, there's different types of uh investments in your [33:04] portfolio for a reason. I famously remember you talking to Sailor and you [33:10] asked them um saying like okay well if Bitcoin is a hurdle rate then why should [33:15] I buy your you know your stock Mr. Right. That was that was a formative [33:20] point for me to end up where I am right now. Like that his answer rocked my world and I've been thinking about it [33:26] ever since. Well, yeah. I I don't want to tell your story. Why don't you briefly tell that story real quick? Well, I so I asked that that question [33:33] exactly as you you said it to to Sailor and he said, you know, for Bitcoin maximalist, Bitcoin is the risk-free [33:39] rate. Um but there's still a place in a portfolio for risk capital even if [33:45] you're on a Bitcoin standard. And you know what what you reading between lines, what does that look like? That [33:50] looks like, you know, trying to take risks in order to grow your Bitcoin because that's if [33:55] you're on a Bitcoin standard, that's the goal. That's the hurdle rate. That's, you know, what you want to accumulate. [34:01] And, you know, I couldn't argue, you can't argue with that logic of yeah, there's place there's a place in a [34:07] portfolio for every individual or institution to decide, you know, how much do they want to hold cold storage [34:12] Bitcoin, you know, effectively risk-f free. Yeah, there's volatility, but you know, if you're on a bitcoin bitcoin

**Peter:**
[34:18] standard, that's your risk-f free. Um, and how how much of your portfolio do you want to try to grow your Bitcoin [34:24] with? Uh, and and that's for every individual and institution to decide for themselves what what do they want to do [34:29] there in terms of allocation. But that's what we're talking about here. And that's that's why this strategy makes [34:36] sense as a concept. And and it's I think why it's incredibly compelling as an [34:42] investment thesis because there's no other there's no other asset out there where you can reliably grow Bitcoin uh [34:50] you know your Bitcoin ownership at the end of the day. You can take risks in fiat world and hope that they outpace [34:56] the like 30% kager that you're going to have with Bitcoin, but that's pretty tough. Like good luck, right? [35:01] Yeah. But with this strategy, you're you're the whole point is to accumulate more Bitcoin over time and grow Bitcoin [35:08] per share. So you've taken out that risk of like, okay, we're going to get out of Bitcoin and then try to run harder than [35:15] Bitcoin and then get back into Bitcoin. Instead, you're you're in Bitcoin the whole time and you're just accumulating [35:20] more and more by using capital market tools to arbitrage what's out there in Tradfi, bring it into Bitcoin, and grow [35:27] your Bitcoin per share. So it's way more compelling and you know and I think you [35:32] know Peter as you know I think this is the the dawn of what I think will be the biggest industry in the world over the [35:38] next two decades. Yeah. I think that Bitcoin treasury companies are the way in which they're going to be [35:44] the preferred manner by which pools of capital in the world come to

**Andrew:**
[35:49] Bitcoin. Tradfi capital comes to Bitcoin. It's going to be through these vehicles that are designed to make it [35:55] easy to get access and make it easy to have Bitcoin ownership um but then offer [36:01] that that that thing that Bitcoin doesn't do which is how do you grow your Bitcoin per you know ownership over [36:06] time. Correct. Yeah. Sailor would say right the only thing better than Bitcoin is more Bitcoin. And so that's exactly why [36:12] you invest in a Bitcoin treasury company is you want to outpace the hurdle rate [36:17] that is Bitcoin. And the only way to do that is to strategically leverage uh [36:23] your balance sheet. Um now that's actually my next question is you know [36:28] Sailor famously said that he will always buy the top. So from your guys's perspective I don't know if you guys [36:34] believe in a bare market. I certainly do. Now maybe not a call it a 80% draw [36:40] down simply because there's so much buying pressure from the institutions. However, I do think it's very very [36:45] likely to have a 50% draw now within Bitcoin. And since Bitcoin treasury companies are levered Bitcoin, uh they [36:52] can go down further. So how do you guys think about buying Bitcoin in call the later stage of this bull run? And how [36:59] would you protect and defend your position um from from the stock price perspective? [37:07] Yeah. Um I I guess I would start by saying that I think for Bitcoin Treasury [37:12] companies, we have been in a bare market for the last seven weeks or so. I think

**Peter:**
[37:17] globally there's been a contraction. Yes. Um for Bitcoin treasury company valuations. MNAVs have have compressed [37:25] um considerably. And um you know I think I think it's a [37:31] fair question to ask like what happens to a Bitcoin treasury company when the tide goes out, right? Like is it still [37:36] possible to execute the strategy? Surely not, right? Um, and yet over the last seven weeks, we've had I I think a [37:42] perfect case study of what of what happens when the tide goes out. Um, I ran these [37:50] numbers this morning, so I'll share I'll share them. But for Smarter Web, the [37:55] share price local top was June 20th and and uh since then um Smarter Web has has [38:05] increased its Bitcoin per share by 381%. Uh which is pretty incredible. It during [38:13] a 7-week long like pullback. Um and and [38:18] yet Smarter Web with with Andrew doing what he does, uh has been able to raise [38:24] capital, continue raising capital, keep buying Bitcoin every week, adding Bitcoin per share. Um and and that's, [38:31] you know, in a in a pretty stiff headwind of of uh I guess sort of a climate of fear for Bitcoin treasury [38:37] companies. Where's the bottom? Um, and so that's the fundamentals have have been continuing to get better and better [38:45] for Smarter Web over the last seven weeks. And I think that's that's kind of the answer right there of like, you [38:50] know, it's still possible to keep adding Bitcoin per share during a bare market.

**Andrew:**
[38:56] Um, I think and of course that, you know, there's still the question of like what happens in a major Bitcoin bare [39:02] market. Um, I know Andrew uh is is is even more optimistic than me, but I [39:09] think that we could see like a 60% maybe even 70% bare market. I think Andrew [39:16] thinks a little bit less than that probably, but um and yeah, [39:22] I I I don't think that we'll see those big draw downs like we've seen at in the past. Obviously, it'll be volatile. Um, [39:29] you know, and that's a great thing, volatility, you know, um, because that's what gives you performance. Um, but I [39:36] personally don't think because of the maturity of the asset, you know, in recent years, I don't think you'll [39:42] necessarily see that unless you get a major world meltdown, you know, uh, you know, a proper economic crash, you know, [39:49] that's the only thing that would do it in in in my book. But the great thing about Bitcoin is that yes, it might go [39:55] down, but it also goes up and it goes up a lot more than it goes down. Um, so I [40:00] think that's worth keeping in mind. The great thing about our business as well is that, you know, we're not leveraged. [40:07] There's there's there's no real debt there. Um, you know, yes, we've got this new Smarter Convert product, which will [40:13] be a small amount of our overall treasury. Um but the worst that can happen there now is we give almost all [40:20] the bitcoin in that portion back. Um so it's a bit like borrowing bitcoin and if [40:25] it converts then you know it converts. It's as simple as that really. Um so you

**Peter:**
[40:31] know the great thing about us is because we don't have um any any debt um we [40:36] don't have to worry about a bare market. So let's say we did have a bare market [40:42] um because you know obviously I've put my life into this business for 15 years. you know, I want this business to be [40:47] around for 10, 20, 30, whatever years. Um, and and and and I don't want [40:53] something over the short term that we can't anticipate to cause a problem. Um, [40:59] you know, if you look in any sector, you know, where businesses often go wrong is where they're well, they're either um [41:05] financially misengineered or they're um they're a victim of management [41:11] incompetence um or greed. Um and um you know we're we're trying our best to [41:17] avoid those things. Um so you know even if if we did which I don't believe we will have a massive draw down in Bitcoin [41:25] you know does it really matter? Um we can actually still run our model in some ways better when Bitcoin is is low [41:32] interest rates are incredibly low. Um you know the model works better in that scenario actually than Bitcoin going up. [41:39] you know, Bitcoin's been sort of um going up slowly in those three and a [41:45] half months since we've been been listed and you know, the company's done okay. Um so, you know, where in the scenario [41:51] where the model works better, then you know, whilst no one will want me to say it, it's not necessarily a bad thing [41:57] because it means we can in theory increase Bitcoin per share much more aggressively than we've managed to do

**Andrew:**
[42:03] it. and and as we've done it, we've probably done it quicker and and faster than anyone else has ever done it [42:09] before. Um, so, you know, I'm certainly not hoping for a a a massive bare [42:15] market. Um, but if it comes, then, you know, we'll we'll just keep going and and and trying our best to, you know, [42:22] sort of keep the flywheel turning. Um, you know, and for the long term, because Bitcoin always in history has gone up [42:29] more than it's gone down quite considerably, in fact. um you know it's it's nothing to really be scared about. [42:36] Um people do with any investment people do need to understand what they're buying though. So you know at the end of [42:43] the day if you can't stomach the volatility of something you probably shouldn't be buying it you know um you [42:48] know and the volatility is what gives you that performance. So it's a trade-off. If you want the performance [42:54] you have to accept the volatility. Um you know as much as some people find that hard to hear. [43:01] Yeah. Yeah. You know, I think it's it's really helpful to for investors to [43:09] understand the mindset of management in a in a Bitcoin treasury company because I think there will be Bitcoin treasury [43:14] companies that take too much risk, get out over their skis and then could get in trouble in a 50% 60 70% draw down. [43:23] Um, and that's based on management decisions of of how they approach accumulating Bitcoin and adding Bitcoin [43:29] per share. I think what investors should want to see is is Andrew's mentality [43:34] here of like we don't want to screw this up like this this we just want this to be conservative and clean and you know

**Peter:**
[43:42] prepared for any bare market even though we think that you know it might not be as severe as in the past. You want to be [43:49] prepared just in case. Um, and you know, the reality is like when you're at a at [43:55] a high MNAV and you have the ability to keep issuing equity and adding Bitcoin per share, like that should be the [44:01] focus. Uh, and you you don't want to take on exotic financing that could [44:07] screw you over in a bare market the way that some Bitcoin treasury companies have started to do and then and then, [44:13] you know, even later entrance will do even more because they need to catch up. So, you know, there's things to be to to [44:19] be wary of. um out there approaches to scaling that investors should be mindful [44:25] of. Um and we don't need to do that. We're we're in a leadership position where we just have to keep doing what [44:31] Andrew's, you know, already got us on track to do. Um and and that's going to [44:36] be the model. I love it. Um we're running up on time, so I just want to kind of wrap it up [44:42] with maybe one or two more questions. But before the questions, I do want to make a comment saying that, you know, as [44:48] you guys noted, it's the MNAV that drives, you know, a higher Bitcoin yield, right? A higher accretion. And so [44:55] maybe it's my from my personal selfish perspective, I would love to see your research or your analysis on you, as [45:04] Andrew was mentioning how if Bitcoin does have a call it a 50 60% draw down, [45:09] it actually might be more accreative. I think that will give the community even more confidence so that in case that

**Andrew:**
[45:16] does happen, the MNAV stays high so that in those periods it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy for you guys to [45:23] generate that Bitcoin yield. Um so I I do want to wrap it up with one final [45:28] question and you guys at this point have talked to despite you know three and a half months of operation have been very [45:33] very effective and been speaking to all different types of people. What are one [45:39] question that you think people should be asking you more of or they're not [45:45] thinking enough of that they should be thinking of? [45:50] One question that we don't get asked very often, believe it or not, is, you know, how much of your net worth is [45:57] exposed to the business. Um, I think that's quite an important one. Um, you know, for me it's it's almost [46:04] everything. um you know so you know there's no one that's more focused than me [46:11] o on that for the future and that's not because I really care about money that much it's for the benefit of my kids [46:17] longer term um so you know when I look at a business I think you know okay this [46:24] is all great this looks great blah blah blah but then what if it doesn't work [46:29] what's the pain that those management are going to be under if that doesn't work you know are they going to keep [46:35] doing it. Are they going to keep doing everything as they should do? Because if it doesn't, that will make a difference [46:41] to them. Um, and I think we're quite good in that regard. Um, in the sense that, you know, myself, the CEO has got

**Peter:**
[46:49] a, you know, a significant stake, but not just a financial stake and also an emotional stake in the business. You [46:56] know, it's a business I described it earlier to somebody as, you know, I've got three kids. You know, one of them [47:01] was a year and a half when I set up the business. the other one wasn't even born. So, it's almost like I've got, you [47:06] know, three kids, not two kids. You know, the middle kid is the smarter web company, you know. Um, so, so I think [47:13] that's quite a good question and and believe it or not, not many people ask us that. Um, you know, um, I don't know. [47:19] Have you got any other questions that people don't ask us that they should, Jesse? You know, it's a really good question, [47:26] Peter. Um, I think that the thing that comes to mind, I kind of inserted the thing that I want people to think about [47:32] uh the most, which is like growth rate versus scale. Um, there's a trade-off there, and you want to be riding the [47:38] thing that's growing the fastest. Um, the fastest horse, as as the community likes to call the smarter web company. [47:45] Um, yeah. Yeah. I think that's that's the thing I want people to think about is [47:50] like I think the reality of a Bitcoin treasure company is you have to run some numbers for yourself to see like does [47:56] this make sense to to give up you know holding you know x amount of Bitcoin for [48:03] less than that in terms of Bitcoin exposure today. Um and the whole point is Bitcoin yield and so you have to you [48:09] know you have to get out the spreadsheet and and understand what what what's involved in that. Um, and and yeah, I [48:16] think I think the other thing that that I wish people would talk about more is, you know, there's a lot of Bitcoin

**Andrew:**
[48:22] treasury companies popping up saying saying that what they're going to do. Mhm. And and I think that it's easy to [48:31] focus on, you know, those numbers and uh the opportunities there, but I think [48:36] that what goes underappreciated, and it's not so much a question as like a as a topic to focus on, is is what has [48:43] execution looked like for each of these companies, uh, you know, over the last month, let's [48:49] say, like what have they done in the last month? Um, and I I think when you look at the Bitcoin Treasury landscape, [48:55] there's no company that has achieved more in terms of executing [49:00] getting done u in the last month than the Smarter Web Company. And and [49:05] frankly, my interpretation of it is that it's the the tone that Andrew sets having run his business for 15 years [49:12] with 250 clients, having to get done every week in order to service those clients. And that is just [49:19] ingrained into how the organization runs and and how Andrew runs the business. Um [49:25] so you know Andrew thinks in terms of what are we doing this week? What have we done this week? Have we done enough [49:31] this week? We we need to get more done this week. Um whereas it's so easy to to be like well we'll get it done this [49:37] quarter, you know, and that's not how this business runs. And so I think if you're looking at the, you know, Bitcoin [49:43] Treasury landscape, um, I think the the the most underappreciated barometer for [49:49] future success is what's the track record of execution and getting done, um, for each of these companies.

**Peter:**
(0:49:56) Yeah. I just want to wrap this up by having an observation. I was there. uh both you uh Jesse and Andrew were present at the Bitcoin investor day which was a Monday uh in Vegas and there was all these Bitcoin treasury companies you know proverbially pounding their chest saying we want to be you know number top 10 blah blah blah blah blah and I distinctly remember Andrew being the most humble out of all of them and at first I dismissed it but then action speaks louder than words so kudos to you guys for speaking quietly but carrying a big stick. Well, that's all for today. I love it. Uh we will have to continue this conversation as you guys evolve as a great next uh Bitcoin treasury giant. So, thank you guys for your time. My name is Peter Dwan and I go by the Twitter handle BTC Bull Rider. Until next time, take care.

**Andrew & Jesse:**
(0:50:42) Thank you.
