**Adam Livingston:**
(0:00:00) Good afternoon, my dearest family. My name is Adam Livingston and I am your number one source for Bitcoin and Bitcoin Treasury company analysis. Today we are discussing Smarter Web Company, an extremely exciting prospect from the UK. So, put down your tea and crumpets so you can like this video and subscribe to my channel to support my work. One more quick comment. I noticed a few of the XRP fanboys who happen to be all Gen X men in khakis ask me if I'm in my mom's basement. You couldn't be further from the truth. In fact, I am in the second floor of my own home. My mother unfortunately refused to buy Bitcoin and now she's begging for meth behind the Town Dollar Tree. Now remember kids, none of this is financial advice. This is financial entertainment. Let's get into it.

(0:01:30) Ladies and gentlemen, financial lunatics and degens of all denominations, welcome. You're about to witness what happens when a quietly competent British tech guy stumbles into the Bitcoin rabbit hole and emerges with a public company duct taped to a uranium shell from 1907 and a treasury strategy that gets me so bullish I think I need a Xanax. This is smarter web company. A name so unassuming it sounds like it sells Squarespace to pensioners. But underneath all that bland UK branding is a fanged little micro cap with a torque profile that makes some of the other players look like they're trapped in molasses. We're talking about a software company turned sats cannibal ripping through OTC rails like it's got a death wish for fiat. They started life as a fixedpric web design firm, respectable white collar little digital agency in Bristol. Then bam, they go full Bitcoin terrorist. Suddenly, they're invoicing clients in BTC like it's El Salvador turning surplus cash into digital plutonium and using a fossilized uranium shell company to IPO. That's a Guy Richie film starring Andreas Antonopoulos. But don't get it twisted. This isn't some gimmick. SWC is now the only UK listed Bitcoin Treasury play with public market rails, OTC liquidity, and the fastest premium compression velocity in the cohort. They are compounding BTC per share at over 5,000% since their IPO in 43 days. That's financial possession. That's a corporate exorcism where the ghost is Satoshi and the priest is leverage. Smarter web is what happens when you plug a cash flowing software as a service into a Bitcoin vending machine and then sell equity into the OTC meat grinder to scoop more SATs before the float even realizes what just hit. This company isn't pivoting to Bitcoin like some desperate gold miner during a midlife crisis. They're weaponizing the capital stack to dismember supply. Buckle up because over the next 15 minutes, we're going to dissect how a sleepy UK web agency reverse engineered a capital flywheel, fused it with a Bitcoin treasury and became the fastest moving vehicle in the public Bitcoin adoption History race.

(0:04:00) All right, let's rewind the tape and walk you through the origin story of this British Bitcoin juggernaut, which spoiler alert starts with a man named Andrew Webbley who basically said, "Screw London agencies. I'll build a remote first software as a service with an actual profit margin." In 2009, while the US was printing trillions to save the banks, and your cousin was applying for his fourth PPP loan, Andrew Webbley was founding Smarter Web in Bristol. Not London, not Silicon Valley, Bristol. That's like launching a hedge fund in Cleveland, Ohio. But here's the twist. Webbley was the ex head of online at Har Greavves Landdown, one of the UK's most buttoned up financial institutions. This guy wasn't just making websites. He was stockpiling the kind of fintech rolodex that gets you invited to private Discords with convertible notes whales. 2010 to 2022, they scale like mad. Thousands of projects, bespoke websites, pre-made templates, SEO packages, logos, every dull but lucrative service. SMMES need hosting and maintenance becomes the golden goose. Sticky, boring, recurring revenue. Exactly the kind of base cash flow a future Bitcoin monster needs to fund its transformation. Software as a service with a side of liquidity violence. 2023. Then the lights flicker. They start accepting Bitcoin payments. At first glance, it's a quirky little marketing stunt. Oh, look. We're hip with the cyber coins. But no, it's the first domino because shortly after they rewrite the Treasury policy to shove surplus cash into BTC. They just nuked the fiat treasury template and replaced it with a laser-eyed war machine. April 2025, this is where the story gets hallucinogenic. They don't IPO the normal way. No, they resurrect a uranium exploration shell company, literally a dead corporate husk from 1907, last seen pedalling uranium and god knows what else, and use it to fact their public listing on the stock exchange. It's like if Tesla reverse merged with a coal mine to save time. They raise€ 1.9 million euros and boom, they've got equity rails and a Bitcoin acquisition mandate. June 2025, two months later, they do a list on the OTC QB as TSWCF. That's right. As of today, you can buy this thing in America. Retail flow unlocked. The Robin Hood goblins can now pump this like it's GameStop with a hash rate. And this next stat deserves its own funeral durge for every slowmoving treasury in the public markets. Nine buys in 43 days. 68 BTC, $18.5 million of Bitcoin purchased at record speed. That's one Bitcoin every 4.8 hours. While the SEC was still arguing about the font size on ETF disclosures, the result over 5,100% BTC per share growth since IPO. That's a strategic possession ritual. You don't see that in corporate finance textbooks. That's how fast capital is now weaponized when you have no boardroom bloat, no CFO choke points, and a founder who moves like he's late for the having. The story here is simple. Smarter web went from a web agency to the fastest reflexive Bitcoin accumulator in the public markets using software cash flow and a zombie uranium shell and no permission from anybody. This is an acceleration event and it's only just begun.

(0:07:30) All right, let's get Executive Snapshot under the hood of this nuclearpowered rocket. Here's the executive snapshot. The forensic autopsy of what happens when a micro cap ditches logos for liquidity and starts snorting Bitcoin off the balance sheet. First off, share price 122, about $155 USD. You could buy one share of Smarter Web or one and a half McChickens. Pre2020 inflation, of course, remember you do live in hell. One of those things is going to make you poor and fat. The other is compounding Bitcoin like it just discovered fire. 248 million market cap. Tiny, absolutely tiny. This thing is a speck of dust floating in the macrocosmos. And yet somehow it's gravitationally distorting capital flows like a black hole. And here's the magic number. BTC on the balance sheet. 168.08 BTC. That's $18.5 million in pure uncut digital cocaine. You think that's small? Let me introduce to you the most misunderstood metric in Bitcoin Finance. Depending on whether you count only the shares live on the tape or every certificate waiting for admission, SWC's MNAV screens anywhere between 8x and 14x. Either way, every fresh BTC buy crushes that premium faster than any listed pier. That means the market is pricing every Satoshi on their books at a 1200% premium. Let me translate that for the fiat zombies in the back. You are paying $12 for every $1 of Bitcoin this company holds. and you are still early because this isn't about spot value. It's about velocity. It's about torque. It's about how fast they can collapse the premium by flooding the cap table with OTC raised capital and vacuuming up more Bitcoin than Tradfi even notices. And this is where it gets feral. The days to cover the premium is 35 days. They can earn back that entire premium through fresh BTC buys in just over a month. That's financial tie-in dilation. So, we get an MNAV months to cover of 1.17 months, which gives us a price compression velocity of 10.6 premiums per month. That's right. This company is crushing 10 full premiums per month. That's the highest compression rate in the public treasury cohort. Smarter Web compresses capital premiums every 3 days like a high-speed hedge fund pretending to be a web agency. And now, the showstopper BTC per share 82 sets. That's up 5,157% since IPO. That's a middle finger to every CFO on planet Earth still debating whether to diversify into Bitcoin slowly over time. Finally, torque adjusted Bitcoin yield, another metric I invented. The formula is simple. You take the BTC per share growth divided by the MNAV. So, you're looking at a 384. That means BTC per share is compounding nearly four times faster than the premium itself. That's real accretion, not narrative froth, not ETFopium. This company is a living case study in asymmetric monetary warfare. It turns equity into Bitcoin faster than your bank. Turns deposits into yield starved government debt. Smarter Web is a premium compression engine disguised as a micro cap operated by a fintech sniper dualisted for liquidity and weaponized for reflexivity. And we're just getting started.

(0:10:00) Now we get to the part of the story that reads like an execution log. This is what it looks like when a public company goes on a 43-day Bitcoin blood ritual. Here's the data. Between April 28th and June 10th, 2025, Smarter Web Company bought 168.08 Bitcoin across nine separate transactions. Let me break it down for you. In plain English, they averaged nearly 4 BTC per week. That's faster than most hedge funds can approve a wire transfer. They didn't wait for dips. They didn't care about candles. They weren't tweeting charts and praying to RSI like your favorite crypto influencer. They moved with pre-authorized regulatory approved exchange clearing ferocity. And you see the pattern here. It's accelerating. The buys are getting bigger, closer together, more aggressive, like a machine learning algorithm that figured out reflexive feedback loops and said, "I can speedrun this." This is not normal behavior for a newly listed British web company. This is what you'd expect from a deep statebacked OTC SCOP. Except it's illegally compliant and funded. You want to talk about conviction? Smarter Web executed faster than the IRS sending you a penalty for using Turboax. They didn't wait for media coverage. They didn't need sailor's blessing. They just quietly began vacuuming supply off the market. While every tradey boomer was still asking what dual listing means. It's elegant and it's terrifying because it shows how quickly a tiny nimble company can frontr run capital inertia and weaponize speed. Bottom line, this is kinetic accumulation. And if this is how they move at 168 BTC, imagine what it looks like at 1,000.

(0:11:30) All right, you've Core Metrics seen the buys, you've seen the spread, but now it's time to open the Ark of the Covenant, the core metrics, and let your face melt off like a riskaverse compliance officer who just saw their teenage son buy Tesla calls with college fund money. Let's begin with the MNAV multiple. Now, the research all the S SWC fans are looking at says 8 something, but my research tells me some differing share counts. Clarification would be helpful from someone across the pond, but I will gladly take either 8 or 13. That means investors are paying between $8 to $13 of every dollar of Bitcoin on the balance sheet. Now, at first glance, this sounds like a bubble, but you're wrong. It's not a bubble. It's temporal arbitrage priced into equity. Because the market isn't pricing what they hold, it's pricing how fast they can add more. The same way Nvidia doesn't trade on current earnings, it trades on velocity of dominance. Smarter Web is doing the same thing, but with Satoshi's. Now, here's where it gets thermonuclear. MMC 1.17 months. Remember, at the current execution pace, this is how long it takes to earn back the premium via fresh BTC accumulation. Let me say it slower for the Tradfi dinosaurs. Back in Q220, they compress a 13.4x premium every 35 days. They compress between an 8 and 13x premium every 1 to2 months. That's premium annihilation at scale. And the result is a price compression velocity of 10.6. They are burning capital efficiency faster than Goldman Sachs burns retail trust. Now remember this acronym like your child's name because it's the torque adjusted Bitcoin yield. This is the truth serum, the narrative slayer, the god metric. We mentioned it earlier. This means they're earning that premium back nearly 4x faster than the premium itself. It's like buying a Tesla in 2012 and realizing Elon installed a warp drive in the cap table. This is what separates the tourists from the missionaries. Other companies hold Bitcoin. Smarter Web converts equity into Bitcoin at velocity. It's not a hedge, it's a conversion engine. Most public companies are still screwing around with corporate ESG reports and Treasury diversification committees. Smarter Web said, "Screw the policy deck. Give me an OTC listing and an ALGO." And now they're compounding BTC per share like a rogue sovereign fund who just hit a crackpipe in a Wendy's bathroom. Final takeaway, they are the fastest, most capital efficient torque maximized BTC accumulator in the public markets. And it's all happening inside a little company that used to sell WordPress sites to accountants in Bristol. This is a SAT accumulating warhead and the countdown just started.

(0:13:00) Days to Cover Really quick from microstrategist.com, we're going to look at the days to cover MNAB to illustrate the metrics I'm talking about. As you can see, we're looking at the red SWC, the lowest days to cover MNAB of the entire ilk. My premium compression velocity metric also screams, "Holy God, this is crushing premium at record speed." That smarter. Look at the small denominator law. 100 BTC buys lift sats per share by 54 sats. The elastic float means 5% new equity around 12 million buys 109 BTC without a whole lot of price impact. And the scarcity premium SWC only UK listed BTC treasury company. It absorbs the entire local hyper bitcoinization bid.

(0:13:30) Now that Torque Cycle we've all accepted that Smarter Web Company is a torqued up Bitcoin vacuum that let's game out what happens when they take this thing to a 1,000 BTC treasury. First up, 1,000 BTC equals $110 million. That's what they're targeting. Why? Because when you're compounding BTC per share like a radioactive hamster on Aderall, 168 coins ain't going to cut it. You need bulk. You need scale. You need weaponized reflexivity. So, how do they get there? Option one is the equity only path, the pure dilution death march. Let's say they raise $99 million via the ATM. They dilute the cap table by 40% and you get your 1,000 BTC sats per share goes from 82 to 380 sats per share, a 4.6x higher even with heavy dilution. The MNAV would collapse from 13 to 3. This is the let's use equity like it's a battering ram strategy. Smash the ATM, flood the bid, hover Bitcoin like a central bank with no elections to worry about. Yes, you're diluting, but you're also compressing the hell out of the premium, resetting the flywheel for another torque cycle. Option two is the hybrid approach, the balanced fiat debt spiral. Raise 60 million, let's say half from 12% preferred or some other method, and half via equity, only 25% dilution. You end up with 450 sats per share and a leaner 3.6x MNAV. This is the Goldilocks route. You keep the equity crowd happy, give the fixed income zombies their coupon, and still walk away with a 1,000 BTC treasure chest. Think of it as the financial version of keto. Less bloating, more efficiency, still wildly unhealthy in the long run, but you looked jacked on the balance sheet. Number three is the debt heavy strategy. The absolute gigachad move. raised $91 million via a 12 million secured note. Delilution zero. That's right, zero shares added, sats per share 535. That's a 6.5x jump from here with an MNAV at almost 5. It's capital sovereignty with a British accent. Remember kids, all three paths, even the worst one, result in a 4 to 6x BTC per share growth. Let me repeat that for every macro tourist still clinging to Apple stock. Even if they go full dilution, the SATs per share number still quadruples. And every path crushes the premium, which reboots the reflexive flywheel for the next cycle of OTC carnage. You're looking at a company that can dilute itself into more intrinsic value. Therefore, that's not dilution. That's capital alchemy.

(0:15:00) Risks All right, we've been inhaling pureium for eight slides straight. So, let's dim the lights, light a siggy, and talk about what could actually go wrong. Because no, there is not a risk-free glide path to hyper Bitcoinization. This is a deathdeying capital circus stunt held together by OTC filings, founder conviction, and the structural elasticity of UK equity markets. Risk number one, you could get a regulatory face punch. The FCA could wake up one morning, read the words Bitcoin Treasury policy, and decide to reclassify Smarter Web as an unlicensed satanic cult. If they tighten rules around crypto treasuries, the whole capital flywheel gets neutered. The ATM stops working, the BTC buys stall, and the reflexivity engine seizes up like an old diesel generator running on orange pills. Do I think it'll happen? No. Do I think the FCA is intelligent enough to know what a Satoshi is? No. But it's still a live grenade. Risk number two, execution lag. If BTC rips and they can't raise fast enough, they get caught midcycle. That's the reflexive death spiral. BTC pumps, stock premium stretches, but they can't raise fast enough. PCV goes negative and suddenly the world's fastest premium compression engine is locked in second gear. This is what we call death by latency. And in the Bitcoin arms race, slow is dead. Number three, there could be a keyman risk. Let's be honest, Andrew Webbley is smarter web. No deep bench if he gets hit by a bus or worse gets hired by the FCA. We're in a founder vacuum spiral. The business model right now is have Webby, let him buy BTC fast, compound like a rogue central bank, and if the guy disappears, so does the strategy. Is this a minimal risk? Absolutely. We could be destroyed by a gamma ray tomorrow. Life is all about risk. Remember, don't listen to me. I'm not your financial adviser. Your financial adviser could probably get you an amazing S&P return that will have you eating Cricut slop in a FEMA pod in under 10 years. Risk number four, Bitcoin draw downs. This is the double-edged sword. Bitcoin drops 30% and the premium doesn't compress, it inverts. Reflexivity goes into reverse. You get a negative PCV event and suddenly your beautiful MNAV flywheel looks like it's vomiting on itself. The solution is more cash fast. That's why liquidity speed is life. OTC access isn't a perk, it's a survival mechanism. Remember kids, in a bare market, we could be playing capital markets tightroppe, walking over molten lava in clown shoes. But here's the thing. These risks don't kill the thesis. They sharpen it. Because what we're watching is a company that can execute faster than most regulators can type a press release. And in a game of reflexive accumulation, speed kills, but it also saves. Smarter Web is a rocket powered dagger aimed straight at fiat's jugular. And that's exactly what makes it worth Investment Takeaway watching.

(0:17:00) Slide eight. Investment takeaways. This is where we spike the mic, torch the Trady playbook, and make everyone in the room question their entire retirement strategy. This is the moment we dropped the curtain. All right, you've survived the metrics. You've endured the timeline. You've stared into the void of premium compression. And now you're wondering, should I actually buy this thing? Let me answer that with a question. Do you want exposure to the fastest moving corporate BTC compounding mechanism on Earth? Because that's what it is. There's asymmetric upside, 248 million market cap, 168 BTC, and a SAT per share growth engine so violent it makes these other clowns look like it's still waiting for a fax machine to confirm the buy order. Every 10 million they raise shifts the SATs per share needle meaningfully. That's what you want in an early stage hyper bitcoinization play. Sensitivity, acceleration, fragile float, reflexive torque. This isn't some sleepy buy and hold, folks. This is a call option on velocity. This has the fastest PCV in the game. They could dilute, compress, reset, and recycle their entire capital structure while Coinbase is still waiting for their quarterly board meeting. Smarter Web clocks in at a 384% TBY. That's torque. That's efficiency. That's proof of acceleration. Most companies sell premium and pray for alpha. Smarter Web mints torque like a sat farm with a printing press. This isn't safe. This isn't boring. This isn't buy on dips and clip coupons. This is buy the freaking premium and hope We Webly doesn't disappear in a puff of regulatory smoke. It's a longdated call option on UK ccentric Bitcoin adoption velocity, leveraged, liquid, and moving at war speed. The bottom line, Smarter Web is still the go-kart with a rocket engine strapped to it. But now the speedometer works. We have a calibrated TBY. We can track premium compression in real time. Now, it's not just early. It's quantified acceleration inside a vehicle barely anyone knows exists. Most micro caps are lottery tickets. This one's a Bitcoin war bond issued from Bristol, dual listed for Global Access, and compounding like a damn black hole. So, ask yourself, are you in the fiat future? Or are you strapping in for the reflexive ride? Because the window is closing, and this company isn't waiting for permission. It's buying Bitcoin faster than you're updating your deck.
