## Key Topics:
- Jesse's background: Management consultant at Bain, Stanford MBA, Bitcoin maximalist since 2018, creator of global asset landscape chart used by Michael Saylor
- Role at SWC: Bitcoin treasury strategy consultant, working daily with Andrew on analytics, investor deck, and growth strategy
- SWC positioning: Early days of MetaPlanet trajectory, order of magnitude larger than nearest UK competitor, clear path forward
- UK market tailwinds: Trillions in SIPs and ISAs can't access Bitcoin directly, creating massive opportunity for Bitcoin treasury companies
- Debt and convertibles: Bitcoin-denominated convertibles preferable, managing leverage ratio critical, SWC currently zero debt
- MNAV explanation: Market pricing expectation of future Bitcoin per share growth, similar to PE ratios but shorter payback periods
- Growth trajectory: Pace will slow in percentage terms but can execute faster than competitors, doubling Bitcoin holdings very doable
- Regulatory environment: UK regulators warming to Bitcoin, doing things the right way is unimpeachable, headwinds diminishing
- Global listings: OTCQB, Frankfurt markets showing strong volume growth, LSE uplisting considerations for future
- Bitcoin treasury thesis: Value is in balance sheet strengthening, fundamentally different from ICOs/altcoins, capital finding greener pastures

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:00:00) And I think that's a huge opportunity for Bitcoin treasury companies to be the preferred vehicle for Bitcoin exposure for individuals, for retail investors, for institutional investors, and eventually for bond capital. And once you get the flywheel going, things happen fast, and you got to keep the flywheel going, and you got to put all your effort into making that momentum. I see the early days of MetaPlanet right now for smarter web. And and I think there's quite a clear path forward to repeating the the journey that MetaPlanet went on as a company and and as a community too, you know, and I think that's extremely exciting. But, you know, you have Smarter Web that's an order of magnitude larger than the nearest competitor in terms of its market cap and its Bitcoin holdings. You've got trillions of capital that should want to get exposure to Bitcoin because Bitcoin has been the best performing asset class over the last 15 years. And I believe that that will continue.

**James:**
(0:01:00) Jesse, thank you so much for for taking the time to join us today. Um, I know you're you're a busy man these days. Glad to be here, James. Thanks for inviting me. You're welcome. Um, could you start with because you know I know who you are, a lot of investors will know who you are, but there's a lot of newer investors that uh maybe from the UK that that haven't come across you yet. Um, could you give us a bit of background? I don't know, your CV.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:01:30) Yeah, sure. Yeah, there's sort of two two CVs, aren't there? It's uh, you know, your general life CV and then there's your Bitcoin CV. And I've have both at this point. Um, so in Bitcoin I, you know, I fell down the rabbit hole. Well, first I got into altcoins. I got into Ethereum in 2016 and um, you know, did well in that and then did really poorly in altcoins uh, in 2018. Uh, had to figure out what I was missing and then found the Bitcoin rabbit hole. Um, and then I became a Bitcoin maximalist. um and started writing uh under the pseudonym of cries about Bitcoin and applying uh you know my skill set as a as a management consultant before um to you know provide analysis about Bitcoin and um yeah I wrote a few pieces that uh became very popular um and became known for those and then in more recent years um I put out a few years ago I put out an article um called Bitcoin's full potential valuation which was an effort to try to use the same management consulting toolkit to uh size the the opportunity for Bitcoin. Um and and nobody had really done that. Um had like sized the market of what Bitcoin was addressing. Um, so you know that you you may have seen this slide, people have probably seen it at this point of uh what Michael Sailor uses this slide of global asset value. Uh, he was 900 trillion of global asset value when I first put that out a couple years ago. I updated it about a month ago for 2025. We're now at a thousand trillion dollars of global asset value. And Bitcoin is now, you know, just two two trillion of that, which means 0.2% 2% of the the total addressable market which is the world's value. Um and so that article Michael Sailor liked a lot and he kind of he adopted that as his approach to valuing Bitcoin. um and and you know built out a model his valuation model is built on top of uh my starting point um which has been really cool and yeah so that's I guess my sort of Bitcoin trajectory as a you know in terms of being a bitcoin analyst and writer um I was running a fund uh it was a crypto hedge fund that turned into a bitcoin bitcoin holding fund as I went through that journey um and then I started um um on-ramp bitcoin I co-founded which is a a uh the pioneer of multi-institution custody which is a a commercial application of Bitcoin's native multi-IG properties uh and a very cool approach to custody where the end user doesn't have to hold any keys but you enjoy the benefits of multi-ig decentralization of um of cryptographic keys um so that yeah that's my Bitcoin resume before I you know I was a management consultant at Bane company and and got my MBA at Stanford um before finding crypto and and then Bitcoin. So yeah, that's that's the full background on me.

**James:**
(0:05:00) Okay, cool. Can you now then maybe describe your role at SWC a little bit?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:05:10) Yeah. Um so I am um consultant for Bitcoin uh treasury strategy. Uh, and um, you know, over the last six months, I started to really do my research on on what Dylan was telling me to like pay more attention to for the last year, which is, you know, what they were doing at Metaplanet and what what they were doing at Metaplanet and pretty awesome um, mechanics there and and and of course with uh, what strategy was starting to roll out with their um, preferred equities ve vehicles and Um so as you know part of that I started to do analysis about uh Bitcoin treasury companies wanted to size the opportunity for for this new industry um and put out some analysis on that recently and um and and that led to me getting involved with UTXO who's kind of the investment firm that's um seeding a lot of these uh Bitcoin treasury companies internationally. their their thesis which I think is right is that there will be a a a winner takes most Bitcoin treasury company in each capital market and um and I think that's right. I think that's, you know, how Bitcoin will um, you know, how how capital in local markets will access Bitcoin uh disproportionately um over time and that's great. And I think that's a huge opportunity for Bitcoin Treasury companies to be the preferred vehicle for Bitcoin exposure for for individuals, for retail investors, for institutional investors, and eventually for bond uh capital that's stuck in fiat bond contracts getting not great returns um you know in the in these little pockets of capital all over the world. So that that uh you know me being involved with UTXO led to uh um getting introduced to Andrew uh and you know I I had some analysis that that I thought would be helpful for him and we just started working together.

**James:**
(0:07:30) And so uh when I met you in Vegas, was this already happening kind of thing in the background?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:07:40) It's it's funny. I I met Andrew uh the the first person I met in Vegas was Andrew. uh he was he was uh heading to the same UTXO event that I was heading to. Uh and he got on the escalator right behind me and I was like, "Ah, you're you're Andrew." And we started talking then. Um so yeah, I hadn't met Andrew before then, but I knew that but I knew that some of the analysis that I that I had been doing um would be helpful for smarter web. Um and so you know I I sort of volunteered that at the you know the first time I met him.

**James:**
(0:08:10) Okay. So how do you think your you've been received like your your appointments been received so far?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:08:20) Uh I I I think very well. It's been really nice that um you know when that announcement went out that I'm formally involved uh people had some really nice things to say which was really cool to see. you know, I was sharing some of that with my wife as as I was reading some of those comments, uh, which was, you know, very very flattering. Um and and yeah, you know, I I uh I think that's because some people who have been in Bitcoin for a long time are familiar with some of my earlier work and um you know, they they they know how I've been impactful for I guess in in a small part um establishing some of the intellectual framework for you know what what this thesis is um you know with regard to Bitcoin treasury companies and and and how that uh is tapping the you know equities markets and and the bigger eventual play of bond market capital which is what strategy is now focused on. Um so you know I I it felt it felt great to to be warm warmly received in that way and you know I look forward to uh uh making good on that with everybody.

**James:**
(0:09:30) you know, of all the the Bitcoin treasuries that you could have signed up for, um, why why Smarter Web, what what do you feel like is the USP or

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:09:45) Yeah. Um, so yeah, you know, in helping UTXO out, they have a few things going on in in the world. I'm I'm helping out in in Hong Kong as well. Um, and you know, the the whole point of these the strategy uh is to get the flywheel going, right? And and once you get the flywheel going, uh, things happen fast. Uh, and you got to keep the flywheel going and you got to make, you know, put all your effort into making that momentum um, you know, work for work for the company and for the shareholders. Uh, and Smarter Web found itself very quickly in that position. Um and and that's extremely exciting. Uh and and it's um you know what it's all about at the end of the day. This this is what you you want to see and and you want to keep going. So you know in many ways I see the um the early days of MetaPlanet uh right now for smarter web. Um and and I think there's quite a clear path forward to repeating um the the journey that MetaPlanet went on and as a company and and as a community too, you know, um and and I think that's extremely exciting and I think that's you know part of why um you know I don't think that there's any company in the world right now that is that has the traction and clarity uh for the the path forward to follow the meta planet. path. Um, nobody has that as clearly as Smarter Web does right now.

**James:**
(0:11:30) Cool. And And do you think some of that is I mean, obviously some of that's down to Andrew. Um, you know, he's ex Andrew's done all of it. But but if you were looking for sort of a favorable environment for for the flywheel to to fly in, um would you say the UK is is one of those environments?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:11:50) Um you know, each jurisdiction has its uh anomalies, but yeah, exactly. I I I didn't really know um the extent to which the UK was hungry for um a Bitcoin exposure vehicle. Um I've only I've only in the last month become aware of and in fact you know maybe you can you can sharpen my knowledge on this but um you in the US we have 401ks that's the you know retirement accounts for individuals and in the UK you guys have sips and uh uh ISAs or ISAs ISAS ISAS yeah so I mean I sips are pensions um And ISAs are just savings accounts. Um and and the the beauty of the ISER is that you can withdraw the money at any time. It you don't have to wait till, you know, 60 or whatever. And and and my understanding is both of those uh pools of capital that that are held by individuals um or institutional on behalf of individuals um both don't have a way to access Bitcoin currently. And um and that's That's a shame first of all for for the UK and for its citizens and its capital. Um, and it's also an opportunity for Smarter Web. Um, because this is the best way to to get exposure to Bitcoin because the balance sheet consists mostly of Bitcoin and the the the stated strategy is to continue to strengthen that balance sheet by adding more Bitcoin per share. Um and and so I think it's you know it's a brilliant tailwind for smarter web. Uh and and I didn't appreciate the extent to which that you know the Japan has its own idiosyncrasies that make it attractive for a Bitcoin treasury company you know versus just holding spot bitcoin. um namely for them there's there's there's a a difference in taxation for spot bitcoin versus bitcoin treasury company um capital gains and and so that makes it more attractive to just hold the the the equity rather than spot bitcoin itself um and I think that's been very important for metaplanet success and of course in the context of you know an over overindted um society which you know everyone is like the UK is also has like not a great fiscal position. Japan Japan's is is worse. Um but you know I I think that I I was guilty of uh thinking that MetPanet was a one-off um because of the the circumstances that that nation is in. But you know there are tailwind ones elsewhere too. And and I I think that the fact that that trillions of pounds of capital doesn't have a way to get Bitcoin exposure because of current regulations. Uh is you know case in point. Um, so now now you have now you have smarter web and its competitors, but you know you have smarter web that's that's you know an order of magnitude larger than the nearest competitor in terms of its uh market cap and its Bitcoin holdings. Um, and you've got trillions of capital that that should want to get exposure to Bitcoin because Bitcoin has been the best performing asset class over the last 15 years. and and and I believe that that will continue because of its endogenous properties. So that capital should want exposure to Bitcoin and the best vehicle to get it is this company that's uh you know 700 billion 700 million pounds uh sorry 700 um yeah million pounds and and the the the the difference in scales between you know a couple trillion pounds of capital and something that's not even a 1 billion pound market cap company When you think about the uh what I expect will be a a a steady stream of of uh reallocation into Bitcoin from that pool of capital. um that will be quite the uh rising tide um that will lift all boats, but I think will disproportionately seek out the um the the most trustworthy, most established, mo most um consistent performer as its preferred Bitcoin exposure vehicle. So that's the tailwinds.

**James:**
(0:16:00) What about what about the potential headwinds uh in the UK? how are you finding, you know, UK regulation and anything else you maybe have come across?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:16:15) Yeah. Um, it's very interesting how, you know, Andrew is very cognizant that regulators have been um not very warm to Bitcoin. Uh, and and it's, you know, very important that that we do everything the right way. Um, but it's also interesting how doing, you know, things the right way and and making Bitcoin part of your balance sheet and strengthening your balance sheet through adding Bitcoin, uh, it's you it's it's unimpeachable, right? Like, you can't argue with that as a as a an approach to running your your business that you've been running for 15 years, you know, like you can't argue with that. um and shareholders seem to also want that, right? And and um the demand for that kind of approach has been very high and and that's because people want Bitcoin exposure. So, it's been very interesting to see um how regulators in the UK are rather quickly starting to change their their outlook, their their approach to Bitcoin. uh and I think that it it may be as a result of what's happening with smarter web and and it and it's um you know the the folks who are trying to follow smarter web's path in the UK. So, you know, in terms of headwinds, yes, uh regulate regulation about Bitcoin isn't where, you know, the US is, but it is warming. Uh and I think that, you know, is a testament to being reasonable. like I I don't think that I don't think that regulators in the UK are unreasonable and I think that they um are open to responding to, you know, what investors expect uh and and and and are seeking and regulators are just, you know, their mandate is to make sure that's that there are the right guide rails um set up to to ensure investor protections, right? Um and so I think I see that that trend actually heading in the right direction of of uh regulators warming up to this maybe maybe catching up to where the US is in terms of you know uh regulation understanding what's going on with with strategy uh and and um accommodating the realities of businesses that want to hold Bitcoin on their balance sheet. Um, so I think that's, you know, I think that's a a headwind that is diminishing. Um, and and that's great to see. Beyond that, I mean, the only the only other like consideration there is that the UK isn't a giant capital pool. You know, it's it's big. It's not, you know, it's it's nothing to to scoff at. I mean, uh, 3% of the world world's wealth is in UK, um, from the numbers I saw. So that's that's a lot of capital that sits in the UK. In fact, you guys um um have more wealth per per capita than uh than the US. Um and and that's you know because of of history of of success and wealth building that the UK has enjoyed. So, you know, that's not a that's not a headwind, but it's a uh limitation on capital, you know, access, but you know, where that where that uh is solved is through OTC listings in other countries, you know, and we've seen volume grow in the US significantly. And and what I've been really excited about is, you know, the uh the Germany um market has been open as of now for four days. This is its fourth day and um volume on that has been skyrocketing. I mean um the third day was gosh what was that uh six times more volume traded than the first day. um which is incredible trajectory and and the demand from Europe is great and I think that comes back to like you know a winning strategy for a Bitcoin treasury company is to have um a local market that is its bread and butter it's it's its home turf uh and its home capital pool that that it is you know well aligned with and if you have that then global capital wants to participate in that because you know that that that home capital pool constitutes, you know, a tailwind, a a steady stream of capital that will be coming into Bitcoin treasury companies in that jurisdiction. Um, and everybody wants wants to ride that ride. Um, and so you end up with that self-fulfilling flywheel because uh that narrative aligns with reality and it is readily digestible too. People understand, okay, there's there's a a dominant emerging Bitcoin treasury company in the UK. It looks a lot like Metaplanet did a year ago in Japan. And there are reasons why a huge chunk of capital in the UK is going to get its Bitcoin exposure through a vehicle like this. maybe this one and and everybody in the world can can can understand that investment thesis. Uh and we're seeing the excitement around that.

**James:**
(0:22:00) Now, so talking of listings, um we're obviously on Aquis, we're on OTCQB, um and now the Frankfurt uh markets. There's a, you know, people are asking you every day, you know, when LSE, when when this, when that. Um, I appreciate that. That's not something you can share, but I'm kind of also interested in OTCQB, you know, if the conditions allowed, would the right trajectory be OTC QX and then potentially NASDAQ or skip OTCQX or just stay where we are, you know? Um, where are your thoughts on that?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:22:30) Yeah, that you know we that hasn't been a topic or conversation uh at the moment. Um and and I think that's uh you know I expect that probably will be a topic or conversation at some point in the future. I think right now the the focus is on um you know growing uh access to you know global investors to this stock. Uh and you know the the OTC markets in in the US have been have been great for that and uh you know we're still seeing the growth of volume there. Um, you know, I I suppose in in the same way that that MetaPlanet has sort of leveled up their um listings over time. Um, we will, you know, entertain the same approach. But for now, you know, so long as we're still still growing into a market and and and not yet uh saturating a market, um, I I I think we're happy with with growth.

**James:**
(0:23:20) You know, another topic of conversation that comes up a lot at the moment is about debt and convertible bonds. Um, I actually had a chat with grain of salt earlier this week um around one of the downsides to to convertible bonds that I hadn't what were his points. Obviously, when they do a convertible bond, they give you the money, but then they hedge their their their bet, right, and and short the stock. I think most people who have awareness of that that's the case. But what I didn't understand about that dynamic is that it kind of collars the stock. Um so it kind of reduces the volatility and keeps you not within bounds because you can still rip but but you know it kind of just compresses you into a channel um and makes it more difficult for breakouts to to occur. Is that kind of your take on it or

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:24:00) Yeah, you know that's a very sophisticated understanding um of these dynamics which you know grain would would have that uh excellent take. Um yeah, I think you know I think the first set of watch outs for convertible notes is the terms that you get uh from from many of these um providers that you know that they want it to include a lot of upside for the for themselves. Um, a lot of, you know, there there's a whole a whole host of, uh, um, lenders who will offer convertible notes with a bunch of warrants, you know, included or, um, you know, some some with with like a ridiculous amount of warrants included and and they're to be filtered out. So, you know, they're they're those are just sharks looking for a company that's desperate for capital. So, you know, and and that's that's most of you what you see at first, but beyond that, you know, if you get beyond that, you can find the potential partners who um are are willing to, you know, stick to actual convertible note terms rather than, you know, toss in a bunch of warrants for themselves. Uh and and and you know, then you're then you're talking, right? like convertible note if you stick to the terms and the terms are reasonable it it can be very attractive. I think an essential part for a bitcoin treasury company is to manage their the the leverage ratio for the business. Um at the moment smartweb has no debt and that's an incredible position to be in um because it it ensures that you're fine in in a 80% draw down bare market. That's no problem. Metaplanet has maintained has made sure to keep their leverage ratio under like 20%. 20 to 30 and and recently they've kind of cleaned out their balance sheet I think in preparation for what's coming um in terms of launching new instruments for you know the point the stage they're in. Yeah. So I think convertible notes that are bitcoin denominated is another important filter. Uh and that's that becomes a lot more interesting because um if it's Bitcoin denominated an 80% draw down for Bitcoin is Bitcoin denominated. So you know that obligation stays lockep with you know the balance sheet of the company and and that protects investors. It protects the company protects shareholders in that eventuality. And it also means that if if you're talking to people who are willing to do to do a Bitcoin denominated convertible note that um they understand Bitcoin because what they want is the downside being performing like Bitcoin and the upside being performing better than Bitcoin. Um and and that's that's a that's not many people. Um and that's good capital. That's that's capital that that as a Bitcoin company, you want to be talking to that kind of capital. That that that that's the kind of capital that wants to see Bitcoin do well. They they understand what you're doing. They they're they're just trying to find a way to outperform Bitcoin and and there's there can be plenty of mutually beneficial ground there. um where you could you know potentially structure a convertible note with 0% coupon on it conversion with a premium attached to it. So it's so it's accreative to shareholders more accreative to shareholders than issuing um shares you know at the current market price which is you know why convertible notes become attractive and it and it allows you to access a type of capital that um that you otherwise don't have access to. So, convertible notes are are are potentially attractive. Um, but you have to navigate that world.

**James:**
(0:28:00) Okay. Yeah, it sounds like there's a few gotchas out there that uh you got to be wary for. How often do you and Andrew like talk on the phone or online uh about smart work?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:28:10) Every day. Yeah, we yeah, we're we're chatting on WhatsApp uh kind of constantly. Um and we are on the phone once a day. Um yeah, so you know, I've been working on a few meaty projects um for Smarter Web. Uh the analytics page that that's now live um was was partly me. It ended up being a fair bit uh Andrew and and uh you know the web web development ace uh Alex on the team u actually implementing that stuff on the on the website. Um but I'm super excited about that excited about building on that because I I've seen how important it is for MetaPlanet to be able to showcase their um their excellent results, right? the the analytics are the product of your your labor. um and and and you know the results of your strategy and execution and smarter web has been absolutely crushing it on those uh you know metrics and showcasing them I think is a big part of telling the story um generating greater investor interest and you know and and I think frankly that's that's about uh communicating to global investors that strategy's done it metanet's doing it. Smarter Web is on the path, too. And um you know, we're still so early in in the history of Smarter Web that the vast majority of Bitcoin investors haven't even heard of of Smarter Web. I you know, I would go so far as to say like most people who hold MetPlanet haven't heard of Smarter Web at this point. Uh and and you would think they'd be very interested. Um, and I think they will be as you, you know, as we start to to shine a light on the track record through the analytics. Um, yeah. So, you know, that's one project I've been working on and will continue to work on. And, um, the the the deck that we've been putting together for that that Andrew talked about uh uh the other day on our spaces um is is coming very soon. I'm I'm literally looking at it right here. So, uh, and and, uh, you know, that's been quite a few hours for me, um, over the last couple weeks cuz, you know, it's there's no way to to make a deck except through, you know, pouring in hours.

**James:**
(0:30:30) Wow. Yeah, I'm I'm definitely looking forward to that deck. Um, hopefully it comes out before this comes out. Oh, yeah. Right. Any any hints on what we've got to look forward to over the coming, you know, weeks and months?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:30:45) Yeah. Um I, you know, if you've been paying attention to to Smarter Web's um you know, mode of operating, uh I think you've gotten a a sense for how consistent, you know, delivery of of uh progress has been. Uh and and I can say that that Andrew is maniacally focused on on continuing that um that pace, that execution, that that progress. And so I I I think what folks can expect in general is a continuation of um that kind of execution. And you know, and and now that I'm I'm in involved, um, you know, Andrew is smartly uh figuring out like what I can take on on top of what he's already doing. Um, and and I think that's kind of how we're approaching it in terms of figuring out, you know, what's next like for for our growth story. What do we need to be um adding? what do we need to, you know, improve on? Um, and how do we level up in general, right? Um, and you know, it's very much he's he's Andrew's got like a super clear vision um and and a dedication to that to delivering on that mission, which is just awesome to see. Uh, so I think that's what people can expect going forward.

**James:**
(0:32:00) Uh just to expand on the the execution thing um I can't remember who who posted it first but um there are a few people who posted I don't know maybe three four weeks ago on X that um you know if if the smart web company carried on on its trajectory on a log log graph uh of bit of of Bitcoin buying um we'd have all 21 million Bitcoin by like the middle of August or something. Um, so obviously that's not possible. Oh, I mean that seems pretty reasonable, don't you think? I mean, if it was XRP or something then maybe, but um, but as we're talking about Bitcoin, how do you envisionage kind of managing that?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:32:30) Yeah, I I I think it is really important for everyone to, you know, recognize the reality of the math. uh that the pace cannot sustain like in percentage terms. Uh that's it's just not possible. Um there is a an inevitable slowing down um that that happens as this type of strategy continues to grow. But you can try to, you know, um, keep that trajectory faster than everybody else at, you know, who who has gotten to this kind of scale. Um, and so those two two things can be true, right, of like it will slow down, but we can still also um execute faster, better than any other uh, Bitcoin treasury company has at this point in its journey. Um and and so I think that's you know what we aim to do. Um I I do think it's important for investors to recognize the reality of that that you know that you can't you can't stack 21 million Bitcoin by August or whatever it is. Um that's not possible. But but it is possible to uh you know get to 2100 Bitcoin faster than any other Bitcoin treasury company has. Maybe we get to 10,000 Bitcoin faster than any other Bitcoin treasury company has. And then milestones beyond that as well. Um you know that I I think it's it's clear it should be clear to everyone that uh Andrew doesn't intend on stopping at any point. like it's not we're going to get not like we're going to get to 2100 Bitcoin and then we're done. That's a good enough position. We'll just stay there. The the entire point is to keep adding um Bitcoin per share indefinitely and and um and there's a lot of runway still still to do that. Um because you know luckily we we are not strategy. We are not in a position where doubling the amount of Bitcoin uh is an astronomical amount of Bitcoin, right? Doubling our our current Bitcoin holdings is very doable and I think we will likely do that quite soon. Um, so that's a that's actually, you know, that's a great place to be uh as a company and as an investor base if you if you have the ability, the line of sight, the mechanics in place to double the amount of Bitcoin per share uh in a short amount of time. That's that's what it's all about.

**James:**
(0:35:00) Obviously, you're pro uh Bitcoin treasuries um because you know you're working in the space. um what would you say to people about uh or the naysayers that say it's bad for Bitcoin? You know, what what what would your message be?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:35:15) Yeah, I I do have a lot of thoughts there. Um, I think it's very easy to to see Bitcoin treasury companies as, you know, analogous to ICOs or something like that in the past that um, you know, a whole host of um, trends that happened in crypto that blew up, right? Um, and and I think a lot of, you know, Bitcoin maximalists, a lot of early Bitcoiners who've seen a lot of that, their pattern recognition goes off of like, oh, people are all excited about this. This stuff is outperforming Bitcoin. Um, it's it can't last. It's going to go the same way that, you know, Celsius and BlockFi went, you know, whatever. Um, the fundamentals are are very different, though. you know, in in these cases, you know, with with Smarter Web, we are accumulating Bitcoin with currently without any debt and and with, you know, zero debt obligations related to that. Um, so the balance sheet just gets better and and shareholders want that. Um, because we're holding Bitcoin and yes, there's, you know, compared to just holding spot Bitcoin in a, you know, in a multi-IG setup that you've created and managed on your own and you you trust no no third parties. Uh, you've got no counterparty risk. Yeah, there there's a little more risk uh to having a company hold Bitcoin on your behalf. Um but there's a place for risk in in anybody's portfolio. And so I actually talked to to Michael Sailor about this. Um I asked him, you know, like you I asked him nine months ago. Um, like I said, I was 100% Bitcoin in my portfolio and and and I was and I asked them, you you know, you said never sell your Bitcoin and I and I live by that, but I have FOMO about, you know, these Bitcoin treasury companies. Um, you know, what do you say like should people sell some of their Bitcoin to buy Bitcoin Treasury companies? and he, you know, he cut right through my kind of setup there for for him and and he said, you know, that the risk-free rate for Bitcoin maximalist is holding Bitcoin, but there's also a place for for risk uh and risk capital on top of that. and and he was right, you know, he you can have your your spot bitcoin that you hold in in your, you know, best-in-class uh multi-IG setup. Um, but you may also have a place in your portfolio for investing in companies whose whose objective is to grow Bitcoin per share. Um and and that is very different from you know the the thought of ICOs or you know investing in altcoins or or um getting getting uh Bitcoin yield through lending uh to greater and greater risk counterparties you know the way that BlockFi and Celsius did. um this is very different approach and I I think it's very interesting that um I'm friends with Pierre Rashard who uh happened to go to the same accounting program that I went to University of Texas. It's best the best in the country. Um you you sure learn the heck out of accounting when you go there. Um, and we are both extremely bullish on Bitcoin Treasury companies and we've talked about how like it's probably comes down to our our foundational knowledge of business is in accounting. And for me, what's so glaringly obvious about Bitcoin Treasury companies is that the value of a business is really its balance sheet. And yes, the income statement tells you about the future growth of that balance sheet, but you know, when you when you buy a business, you're you're executing the transaction on the balance sheet and secondarily on the income statement. Uh, and with the Bitcoin Treasury strategy, there's, you know, what companies are engaging in is strengthening their balance sheet. And that's that's incredible. that that's very fundamentally valuable to the business and to the shareholders and and that's super different from the pattern recognition that I think a lot of people see when they when they see Bitcoin treasury companies doing well. The other thing I'd say too is that um I think that the pace of Bitcoin treasury companies the the rate at which they're growing that's part of the pattern recognition of like this can't be sustainable. But I think what people are missing is that there is so much capital getting, you know, paying paying too much for equities in the traditional market. You know, when you buy Apple, you're buying a 35 PE ratio for a company that's not growing, right? Like that's not value investing. And so, and you have to overpay for equities because everything is is overvalued. Uh, and in the bond market, you're you're actually, I think, destroying value if you, you know, take the true true inflation rate. Um, Which I think is like 7% and and most bonds return less than that. So, you're you're destroying capital if you hold bonds. You're overpaying if you hold equities. And now there's a strategy here by shifting from fiat to Bitcoin as the backbone of a of a balance sheet of a capital structure. There's a ton of value to be had there. And I think the rate of um you know, Bitcoin treasury company growth is because tiny percentages of these massive buckets are seeing you know what like there's value there and I and and what I currently have is overvalued so I'm going to go reallocate some capital to these companies. Um and and people I think miss that that you know that's it's not unsustainable. Sure. the the rate of of of of change will slow down but is fundamentally driven by capital finding greener pastures.

**James:**
(0:42:00) I mean, yeah, you mentioned about things being overpriced um and there was a there was a podcast that came out yesterday uh uh in the UK uh trying to expand a bit on um uh Bitcoin treasuries. Was this Marin talks money? I I I listened to it. Yeah. Um and then, you know, there's quite a lot of cheap shots in there, which which is to be expected, but one of the things that was was kind of scoffed at a little bit was MNAB. Okay. And um again, it was kind of scoffed at by the the presenter on CNBC BC this morning. what I wanted to shout at the into my headphones was um but if you look at REITs um they're actually valued at like 6 to 7 m now or at least that's the stat that I've been given on them um which kind of blew my mind because it's like oh my god there's this already exists you know they've got the asset value on on their balance sheet had a great point on CNBC today of uh you know, like companies, what what's a PE ratio? You're you're you're pricing in the future value. Discounted discounted future value right there. Um uh you know, of those future cash flows, you're you're discounting into the present and and you expect you factor that into the valuation of the company. And and what's an MNAV is an expectation. It's the the market's pricing of here's how much we're willing to overpay now in Bitcoin terms because we know that they're going to keep adding Bitcoin per share and we're waiting, you know, and and the market has determined they're willing to overpay by this much in in in Bitcoin terms uh in order to get a ticket on that train now, right? because because that train is not going to stop at, you know, one one is going to ostensibly keep going beyond the uh the the Bitcoin price that that you are buying in on.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:44:00) Yeah. So, I I think that, you know, I think it's a it's a it's a strange concept to wrap your head around if you're in traditional finance. Um but it comes back to the fundamentals of you know Bitcoin is repricing global capital and there's a massive transition from fiat capital to Bitcoin capital and uh as that you know I think Bitcoin treasury companies are the conduits the channels the the capital pumps as I've described um strategy for facilitating that that transfer of capital sitting in equities and in the bond market to flow into Bitcoin via Bitcoin treasury companies. Um, and and that's the business model, you know, it's like we're going to keep adding Bitcoin to the balance sheet and we have this much Bitcoin on the balance sheet today, but you know, 3 weeks ago we had this much uh on the balance sheet and we've been adding we've been adding Bitcoin per share uh relentlessly and the mechanics allow us to continue that into the future. So, you know, what price are you willing to pay in order to, you know, get your get your your seat on that on that train? Um, and and interestingly to me, I mean, you know, in in the Apple scenario, you're paying 35 PE, which which literally means you're you're paying for 35 years. you you're you're not expecting to get the the the value of your investment back for 35 years. Uh and with Bitcoin Treasury companies, it's a lot shorter. Um and with Smarter Web, it has, you know, historically looking been the shortest of the number Andrew used today was 35 days to cover that MNAV. Um, so it only takes 35 days for you to to you get your your get your money back uh despite having overpaid um in theory in Bitcoin terms for that ticket on the train.

**James:**
(0:46:00) I want to finish with uh going back kind of full circle and uh asking sort of who who is Jesse, you know, what do you enjoy? Uh where he based, you know, all that kind of stuff.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:46:15) Yeah. Uh I'm I'm in I'm in outside of Austin, Texas. Um I'm from uh Pasadena, California originally. Um have you ever seen the Rose Parade? Is that a thing that people in the UK have ever seen a news clip of? No. Okay. Or and you guys are like vaguely aware of college football, right? But but not Yeah. Okay. So, uh, Pastine is the home of the Rose Parade and the Rose Bowl, which is, you know, one of the big venues for college football. Um, anyway, who am I? Uh, you know, it's funny how Bitcoin changes you and changes what you are and, um, it adds this whole like layer to your identity. So, you know, you kind of end up being who you were before Bitcoin and then who you are post Bitcoin and you're kind of amalgamation of it. You know, this um you're you're both things at once. Uh and and I'm kind of all over the place in that sense. I mean, I'm I recently wrote a uh after stepping back from my prior role, I had a few months to finally write this article that I have been meaning to for years. Um and so I did all sorts of research into um you early human um was that the once in a species? Yeah. Yeah. Once in a species uh which was has been the you know title of my my newsletter for years but I always intended to write this piece about uh how Bitcoin is a once in a species event and and and how money and the concept of money was our evolutionary advantage over Neanderthalss and other early humans. Uh, and as I dug into that research, I like, you know, kind of found some some um some findings in neuroscience and some findings in in uh anthropology uh that tied together into a a new theory, a new thesis on um how humans out competed all other early human groups and why from a you know based on a a single point mutation in our DNA that drove a change in our um development of our neoortex and the frontal lobe. So uh you know that's what I did with my time off over the over over the last few months while I was also getting sharp on um Bitcoin treasury companies and realizing that this is the thing this is the thing I want to be involved in right now. Um, so you know, I guess I just use that as an anecdote of uh I'm a little bit all over the place in terms of my intellectual interests and and uh and what I'm passionate about, but you know, I think I think most Bitcoiners share the the it's a problem how Bitcoin comes into your life and uh makes everything pale in comparison in terms of its significance for the world and for for humanity, for your and for your family too, for you and your family's financial future. So, it ends up um becoming such an important part of your identity, you know, inevitably because you care so much about this for yourself, for your family, for your country, and and for the you know, betterment of mankind. Um so, you know, that that that's been the defining attribute of my identity. And certainly for my uh uh non- Bitcoiner friends, you know, for to them I'm the um the crazy Bitcoiner still, but uh increasingly I'm the crazy Bitcoiner who is right. So I hope that trend continues as well.

**James:**
(0:49:30) That's cool. Thank you very much, Jesse. It's been a pleasure to have you on. Um really appreciate the time and uh I look forward to speaking to you again in the future.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:49:45) Yeah. Yeah. James, we we can't we can't end without saying how uh uh you and I chatted over um while you were waiting for your for your burgers in Vegas and uh about the uh you know how excited you were for Smarter Web and and how I was waiting for the OTC listing to to come online in in the US and uh and I should have I should have called up Fidelity and got my money in earlier, but I didn't.

**James:**
(0:50:10) Yeah, I'd forgotten about that. That was a a chance meeting. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's good fun. Well, uh glad to have done this. Thank you for inviting me on and um yeah, you know, look forward to to doing it again as we continue to grow uh the strategy for smarter web.
