**Vostra:**
(0:00:00) Hello everyone, Bostonra here. 25th of July, the Smarter Web Company plc. Make sure you're subscribed and liking the share price action. BTC purchase today. 1 million pounds in cash left. Let's go through bit by bit.

(0:00:30) Right, what did we close up on the 25th of July? The share price for the Smarter Web Company PLC, a bid of £2.15. Let's make sure we refresh that. Yes, 2 pound5 indeed. Okay, where does that take us on the MNAV? Showing me an MNAV closing MNAV for the week of approximately 3.4.

(0:01:00) Everybody, we had a Bitcoin purchase announcement this morning. Let's take a look at that. Bitcoins purchased 225 bitcoins added. Average purchase price of 87,000 just over 20 million almost spent. taking the total Bitcoin holdings to 1,825. Amazing. Amazing. Brilliant stuff.

(0:01:30) So, let's add all of that into our model. And we have Yeah. 8 1,825, 1 million in cash, approximate net assets value of 158 million as at now.

(0:02:00) Um, with 1 million in cash left, what are we going to do next week? I hear everybody say, "Well, the last time the cash got so low, which was not that long ago on uh on or around the 9th of July, well, there was a book build shortly after. Is that going to happen now? There's 1 million pounds of cash left. Let's take a look at the uh approximately the Bitcoin purchases. The Smarter Web company likes to buy Bitcoin if you haven't heard by now. And the Bitcoin purchases are fairly regular pretty much on a weekly basis, I'd say, looking at this and for the past few weeks, they kind of hover around the 200 something mark. So, let's take let's imagine the next purchase next week is about 200 bitcoins at the current price of about £86,000. You would need about £17 million. I make it. Where are we going to get £17 million from? I wonder by next week.

(0:03:00) We have a ATM functioning in the background. Of course, everyone knows about the ATM. However, that's only being activated on up days. In fact, in fact, if I look at the some work done in the um X community, I think our friend uh John John Thor keeps a good record of ATM activity. Let's see if I can find it for you quickly. John Thor John Thor. Let's see. Let's see. You do have a Here we go. This is what I wanted to see. John Thor's latest ATM update. Best effort. Oh, take this with the best effort pinch of salt. Currently sitting on 21.6 million of proceeds from the recent 14 million tranch that's being sold in the background there on up days. So that was 10 hours ago. So that leaves 7.3 million shares to be sold. Remember, you can only sell 20% of the trading volume. So what is the likelihood of that completing next week? It could it could. Today it was in action. We saw um the the shares being traded there at uh above the previous day's closing price for periods of time. So we know that this was printing. But I would not suspect that I would rely on just the ATM if I was uh running the game here. which means that there is a high chance of another fund raise is my uh two cents and um because the ATM completing that would be 30 million pounds roughly. But will that complete next week or will it fall into the week after remains to be seen but with the ATM and the previous raises for the month that would take the business to just over 80 million raised. Compare that with the previous month of 88 million. I would not be surprised if there is a book build um in action in the background.

(0:05:00) Now, we know that the previous book builds have always been um at a higher price and the last two were at 2.90 and 2.95. The current price it seems to be hovering around the 2132.15. and it just closed before. And we've seen in a previous video that it does not take much to get the stock to the price of a book build. It does not take much at all. In fact, that can happen in the last half an hour of trading and a book can be built. We saw that on the 18th of July£17.5 million was raised. It was a minimum raise of 15 million. I'm thinking this is the second part of the book build coming soon. Who knows? But that would then make sense because then the cash would be topped up and you're back onto your 200 plus a weekly purchase trajectory. And in fact then that with that additional 17 million you could then be finishing not far off £100 million of July and that compares very nicely to the previous month and therefore the business can always say it's raising more capital month on month. I would like I'll take that. I'll take 80 88 million and then the 100 million for the following month. I would take that. Let's see. Either way, it's it's all positive. But um we've seen before you don't let your cash run down that level without having something in the background happening. We shall see if this prediction rolls out, but expect some activity here early next week. I am uh looking at this intently like you are.

(0:07:00) So with that said, 1 million cash left. Let's see where the chart's going. The S SWC chart, you can see here on the chart that the support at the 2 level is fairly protected. The book build last time happened at the two just over the 290 mark. It doesn't take much to pop the stock back up there. You can see actually it was trading at a low of 210 on the previous day of the book build for the last book build. So it can get up to the levels required. No problem. It would uh not take much. Um let's see. As we're speaking the US market, yeah, it's hovering around the $3 mark also seems to be attaching itself to the lower resistance line here, support line here on the one at $310. Uh the market has been very very very negative all around. Metal planet down. AltPG down, MSTR down, H100 down, coin down. This is a down down down down down down down down down down situation. The only thing that is looking up is SWC and that also adds to our theory that there is something more happening in the background. Let's get ready for a book build. That's what I'm thinking. Here we go.

(0:08:30) Let's go to your comments. There's a few comments from last time. And deep star says, "If the company does not want to publish public wallet addresses, that is their right. If you do not like it, you don't need to invest in the company. I would prefer that they keep them private." Well, that's what Sandeep says. Keep them private. What do you think? This was the proof of reserves point that we were talking about a few days ago. Well, a day ago.

(0:09:00) Man 69 says, "Top TV is back. Last few days have been tamed. Roller coaster day, but the great recovery all down to your return, Vostra. That's it. You know, when we back in the seat, things start moving." Grant Mail 4112. I'm so far down on SWC. I've given up checking. LOL. I have the worst ability to time the market for the same price. I could have an extra 1,000 shares from what I play. Yeah, it is a volatile stock. You if you observe it, you can see that it is a very very volatile stock. All I can say is just uh extend your time frames and hang in there because the models and the the work that we do in the background here shows us there is a a path uh a clean path forwards.

(0:10:00) Medic 8, I appreciate conservative price predictions, but we also know Bitcoin is going to over 1 million in time. That means share prices for SWC are so high that they're nuts to even consider. Yeah, exactly. They are nuts to consider when you factor in all sorts of things like this. Uh the future is always bright. It it always comes back down to your time horizons and how long you you're holding or can hold. You should just hold forever in certain instances. I guess um everyone understands you need fiat to live from. So that's the thing. Is there a way in the future potentially? Would there be a ways to um receive fiat against your equity stock? That could be one way. Yeah, I mean u people do lend against shares uh if they're worth um to do that for in the future, especially with the Footsie up listing. This is um in relation to the price prediction.

(0:11:00) Let's um let's talk about that a little bit more. I would dismiss the bear case and utilize the base case as the bear, the bull as the base. So, what will be the real bull? says Paul Cotm 3239. Yeah, let me go through the um the the price prediction that I did the other day. This is the the model. Let me know what your thoughts are. I've literally just taken cash projections for the rest of the year. I've plugged in some MNAVs and got a few results out of this and average as well. This is um yeah according to some of the feedback there a very conservative outlook but this is yeah this is a model that can be smashed right this is again it's the mnavs anything can happen with the navs if the market sentiment is there then these can shoot right back up um but for a purpose of a of a simplistic model and um I mean you can play around with this let me know do you want uh to have access to this I can drop a link and you can just plug in your own numbers and MNAVs and see what you think and that will just split out the share prices accordingly and um yeah very easily the the I can just show you now if you put that up to 4 MNAV look at the impact on the share price it's like um significant massive so it really is down to the MNAVs and if you want to have a base case I can you know you very reasonably justify a minimum three as a premium $120,000 a $400 100,000. I mean, we we know that there the business has already raised uh £80 million in the previous month and is on track to do the same um this month. So, this base case is is can be blown out if the the funding is increasing every month. And actually, your even your bull case is is not um yeah, but Paul has a point. Maybe I mean this bare case is literally a bare case and we've been stuck around two pound for the last few days. Um and that could be very well be the floor. I mean these prices may never come back again the two pound and if that is the floor then everything else is north right. So it's good to have a framework and um uh yeah that's where the model comes and arises from.

(0:13:00) So thanks for your comment Dave's World 6206. Good effort on your model but it's not entirely accurate. I understand for the sakes that you need use across the board fixed in inputs such as 3.5 amp nav for capital raised or 100 bit but in reality these are all variable inputs. Yeah, 100% agreed. For instance, in a bull scenario, Bitcoin would not cost 150,000 per per coin. It would likely cost an average of closer to the medium between 118 115 something like 134. Therefore, the company would have been able to buy far more Bitcoin than your bull case suggests. Also, in a bull scenario, the company would benefit from several spikes to extreme MNAB levels, likely back in the double digits or no less than seven, so they could average over five for capital raises. If you look at the price behavior of MetaPlanet and how they were able to take advantage of spikes in their MNAB as it swung from the mid twos back over seven, you will get a better idea of what I'm expecting for SWC. I see a far higher price target possible by the year end. Dave's world makes some very valid points there. It is entirely to do with the sake of simplicity and yeah these models you can get quite granular with them. you can uh factor in multiple levels of inputs even with the um comments there around you wouldn't get to 150,000 each time you know it would be a blended uh blended situation the mnavs here that you're raising at would be changing and constantly variable all valid points these models do need to be you know there's no financial advice no it's all entertainment and um on that note yeah we're trying to take a blended view of everything. Even there just is flushing out at £4 at a very conservative 4 I'd say which is 100% uplift from where it is now. You know these are very very uh framework type uh analysis here to just give you some level of a understanding of how the models work b the uh yeah the potential price targets in in these type of environments. But again, I would have to agree these are very very conservative numbers here. You there's no Footsie up listing premium. There's no other products here considered. And uh yeah, the changing MNAV, look at this MNAV here is a very kind of conservative MNAV. But when you're also building this in a market that we've just come through, h it's natural, right, to have um a conservative framework to then build out from. But, uh, I wouldn't be complaining at this point. And again, this is just end of year 2025 target, right? Or or a model. Um, 7,000 bitcoins. This can be blasted through easily uh if the footsy uplifting happens potentially in September, October, and all of a sudden these numbers are completely out of uh sync because then you're talking about raising couple of hundred million pounds at a time. and and with that level of acceleration then you're you're talking yeah as extreme uh numbers here that are um not modeled. So we shall evolve this as time goes and uh let me know if you want access to this as well. Just drop a comment. Thanks for your comment Dave's World.

(0:16:00) The Sirill D early days. Sorry mate, but there are better investment opportunities out there if you're correct. I'm 50% down at the moment so I'm glad I didn't put too much in. I'm buying the real asset moving forward. You should always have the real asset as well moving forward in my opinion. Um, buying at the top is dumb. Buy at the bottom from now on, says B2H1. The Sirill D buying paper Bitcoin is perilous and hard to judge. Lesson learned. I heard SWC was cheap two weeks ago. Yeah, look, it's if you're if you're getting in now, it's it's arguably cheap because it's the the the Bitcoin is increasing. the the business is buying more and more Bitcoin. So, these flaws will always be increasing. So, it always comes down to your time horizon. Um, if you extend those out, then then you're you're never you're not going to be down. It's like somebody else's comment. Bitcoin's going to a million million dollars. Um, so you just need to you take a pinch of salt with all of this stuff and and if you if you want 24hour boosts, then maybe there's a better way. But uh you've got to understand time horizons here.

(0:17:00) Uh Pricey 23100, wouldn't Adam Bax Bitcoin treasury company when it's launched be the fastest horse considering it will start with around 30,000 BTC? Pricey. So this is a really interesting question. When a a business launches with um a higher amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet, how does the trading premium in that environment enable it to get to the next slug, let's say? because the increase of Bitcoin yield when you're starting at a higher number will be arguably less than what it is obviously when you're starting from a lower base. So you will need a um a much larger capital raise to be able to get the yield for the same amount of um maybe not effort is the right word but the the yield versus the capital raise and the speed at which you do that. It remains to be seen if the market is going to be awarding the same levels of premiums that it does to somebody starting from a lower base. But yeah, when you know the the rate of acceleration is what gives I guess the S SWC the faster source title. If you're talking about just straight up from uh from scratch starting with 30,000 bitcoins, then then that's a different ballpark and ball game. Sorry.

(0:18:00) Um really enjoy your context says Bongo Sid 931 SAT stinks. Wouldn't touch it with a barge pole. This was the competition, right? Everyone's talking about the the this is game theory in action. Everyone's going for the marbles. There will be other competitors in the market and uh time and time again will come down to the execution skills, the management ability and the efficiency of the capital structure. I mean, let's look at the let's see what happens next week because as we've seen, there was a book build and that was managed cleanly, I'd say, at the 295 level. Um, Andrew clearly does not want to uh make earlier investors worse off than later in investors and that for me speaks a lot about capital structure and capital management and um these are the small points of detail that will matter at um at scale as well.

(0:19:00) Um Paul D7739 says this sucked. What was that? That was the the shorts. The uh Yeah. Well, thanks for the comment. I mean, everything is being experimental here, so hopefully the next short is um a bit more to your liking. Ericson 3429. The unique strength that SWC has is Webly. Yeah, we were just talking about that. He's clearly setting fair and ethical standards, not involving offshore shenanigans or selling shares below market price. I own some Coin Celium, too. O where obviously the same can't be said but maybe that technique will work out too. Different approaches in the in the game of accumulating BTC. This says it all right. The unique strengths um the execution ability is uh second to none here and um very excited to see this play out.

(0:20:00) So that was the Q&A part. I wish you all a very good weekend. Thank you. Vostra signing out. Shiao.
