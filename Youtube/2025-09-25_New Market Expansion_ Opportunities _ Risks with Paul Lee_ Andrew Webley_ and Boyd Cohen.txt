**Paul Lee:**
(0:00:10) [Music] Hi guys, can you hear me? (0:00:16) Okay, great. All right. Uh, my name is Paul Lee. I'm the co-CEO of uh, Korea's (0:00:18) Paul Lee - Bitplanet in Korea (0:00:22) first um, institutional Bitcoin treasury company in Korea called Bit Planet. We (0:00:27) are we're pretty new. Uh we fully closed our deal literally seven days ago. So (0:00:34) last Wednesday. Uh and we announced our deal about three months ago. Um so I'm (0:00:40) here to talk about Korea. Uh Korea I think is probably one of the most exciting countries to launch a Bitcoin (0:00:47) treasury business. Uh right now um there is a lot of investor demand. In the (0:00:52) short time we have launched. uh our stock is the most uh uh the highest (0:00:59) performing stock across all exchanges in Korea year to date. Um so there's (0:01:05) obviously a lot of demand which comes with opportunity. Um what are the long-term opportunities that are (0:01:12) specific to Korea? I can talk about a lot of things. I think there are several um there are tax arbitrage or you know (0:01:18) favorable tax structure uh for uh bitcoin treasury companies that's very (0:01:25) similar to metaplanet which has not enacted yet but it will be there in about 15 months um I can talk about the (0:01:34) maturity uh and size of the capital market in Korea and and Korea being one (0:01:40) of the you know rule of law country in Korea which in Asia, which is pretty pretty rare uh actually in in Asia. Um (0:01:49) and Korean capital market and institution investors are definitely ready to take in a lot of credit uh (0:01:56) instruments that Michael Sailor uh kind of outlined this morning. Um I can talk (0:02:02) about the new president uh the new administration uh uh favor new (0:02:07) administration's favorable stance towards crypto uh which is sort of an 180 degree uh uh change since the last (0:02:15) president and last administration. Um but uh one thing I am most excited about (0:02:21) uh is actually the macro reality of Korea and the lack of or the fact that (0:02:27) uh the Bitcoin narrative, the healthy Bitcoin story has not yet taken root in (0:02:33) Korea. Um so let's talk about macro in Korea. So first is population. Um you (0:02:39) probably heard Korean birth rate is the lowest in the world like by a big margin. is actually in the sixes. Um in (0:02:48) about 60 years, Korean population is going to cut in half of what it is (0:02:53) today. The the growth rate of GDP in Korea is has dipped below 2%. I think for the (0:03:00) first time in in many decades and that means what that means is that uh the (0:03:07) what that means is the national pension fund uh the size of national pension fund uh projection of national pension (0:03:13) fund size is like this um which means in about 10 to 15 years national pension (0:03:20) fund is going to decrease in size in about 40 30 to 40 years it's going to be (0:03:26) zero um and it's it's a big fund is I think (0:03:31) uh Korea's pension fund is probably the third largest pension fund in the world and a lot of people depend on it. If (0:03:38) you're a 40-year-old you know working person like me in Korea if you want to retire in 25 years that means there will (0:03:45) be a really little social safety net available for you. Um and let's talk (0:03:53) about real estate, right? Uh soul real estate is insane is comparable to that (0:03:59) of Manhattan. Um the difference between the US and and Korea is that a lot of (0:04:07) economic infrastructure, business infrastructure is focused in Soul. So if you're priced out of Soul, uh you know, (0:04:13) you're basically cut out from a lot of economic opportunities. If you're 20, if you're a 30- year old Korean person (0:04:19) making 60 70k in a year in Korea, which is upper middle class income in Korea, (0:04:24) you know, you probably would, you probably need to, you know, win a lottery or, you know, inherit some money (0:04:30) from your parents or, you know, trade trade memecoin to to make 100x uh to get (0:04:37) married, have kids, and and and buy an apartment, etc. So (0:04:43) on the other hand, uh the retirement fund, 401k, they're all focused on very (0:04:48) safe four to 5% yielding principal guaranteed like CD like products. So in (0:04:56) so that that's sort of an illustration of how polarized uh Korea is in terms of (0:05:01) macroeconomic uh structure. Um there's a lot of disconnect across different (0:05:07) investor group, different generations. uh you know uh working class and non-working class (0:05:14) and what I truly believe is that that Bitcoin is actually one of the best (0:05:21) powerful tools or best assets to actually bridge that gap. Um and uh by (0:05:29) caring to you know people across all uh investor groups by being a high growth (0:05:35) um asset that is maturing to be one of the most important macro assets in the world also by being a safe and durable (0:05:44) asset u that is one of the most liquid asset in the world and that sort of (0:05:50) aligning Bitcoin uh with the the sort of a macro reality (0:05:55) of Korea. I think that's really the biggest unlock and the biggest opportunity there is in Korea and that's (0:06:02) what I'm most excited about. Um, and I said a lot of bad things about (0:06:07) Korea, but you know what? Koreans work hard. I love Korea. And uh, you know, when they find the collective vision in (0:06:14) Korea, they they go at it and they form community very quickly. And I envision (0:06:21) that collective vision to be vision of Bitcoin, Michael Sailor's vision, Satoshi's vision. And that is why I'm (0:06:28) most excited about what I do. U and that I think is probably the biggest opportunity uh Korea has. So that's it (0:06:35) from me. [Applause]

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:06:43) Good morning everyone. Just had to check the the time then because obviously I've (0:06:45) Andrew Webley - Smarter Web Company in UK (0:06:49) just come over from the UK so different time zone. Um so my name is Andrew and (0:06:54) I'm the founder and the CEO of the Smarter Web Company and I just wanted to tell you a very brief bit about our (0:07:00) story and then I picked out three things that I think are worth talking about briefly. Um so I set up my business in (0:07:08) 1999. I started my career in 1999. Um, I worked at a small company that became (0:07:15) one of the biggest companies in the UK. Um, one of the largest retail brokers in (0:07:21) the UK. And then I left there after 10 years because I got bored. Um, so I set up my own small technology company 15 (0:07:28) years ago, the Smarter Web Company. Um, and then I found Bitcoin almost 10 years (0:07:34) ago. Um, for me it wasn't until Michael Sailor, who is obviously incredible, um, (0:07:40) put public companies and Bitcoin together, um, that I really thought that, you know, this is the answer to to (0:07:47) everything as far as I'm concerned. And then in the UK, we didn't have a Bitcoin (0:07:52) treasury company. I started looking about three years ago for one um, because I wanted to make an investment (0:07:58) in one um, and there wasn't one. So eventually we got to last year and and I (0:08:03) decided that I'd list my business which is you know what I did and why I'm speaking you today. Um we listed the (0:08:11) business in April 2025. Um so that's 5 months ago. Um I'm credited with um (0:08:19) pioneering the strategy in the UK which I'm you know very grateful for. Um I'm (0:08:24) more proud of the fact that everyone told me that I couldn't do it. Um they said it wouldn't work. I pointed out (0:08:30) strategy, I pointed out MetaPlanet, they still told me that it wouldn't work. Um, (0:08:36) but we have become the best performing IPO in the UK ever. You know, obviously (0:08:43) [Applause] obviously there's volatility in the (0:08:49) market at the moment, but you know, I'm really proud of that fact and you know, I believe that the best is yet to come. (0:08:55) Um, so our focus is delivering Bitcoin yield. Um, you know, we do have a small (0:09:02) operating business, uh, which is an important aspect of what we do. It's something that I'm very proud about because I'm a programmer myself. Um, but (0:09:11) everyone asks me what what makes us different. Um, and I think the second (0:09:16) thing that I'm going to talk about um is the way that we communicate. Um so right (0:09:22) from the start we've tried to do everything openly and transparently as much as possible is as you can do with a (0:09:28) public company. Um and I think that that has has worked so far. Um it's given us (0:09:34) the third largest uh investor community on X only behind strategy and metaplanet (0:09:41) almost 4 and a half thousand uh individuals in that community and I'm pretty proud of that. So I wanted to (0:09:48) briefly talk about these three things. Um so firstly capital. Um so I loved (0:09:54) hearing Sailor talk earlier and and his uh wise words. Um and he says everything (0:10:00) much better than I will. Um but the thing that I would like to say about capital is that bearing in mind everyone (0:10:07) said that I couldn't do this. In 5 months we've raised over200 million pounds of pretty much pure equity. We've (0:10:13) got a tiny amount of convertible uh Bitcoin denominated debt. Um but we've (0:10:18) managed to raise 200 million and we could have raised an awful lot more. So the the advice that I'd give to anyone (0:10:25) thinking about doing this strategy is there is no rush here. You've got to move fast and they all joke that we're (0:10:31) the fastest horse, but get the right capital. The wrong capital will cost you dearly. Um and it may even be worse than (0:10:38) that. It might end the game. Um so so yeah get the right capital. (0:10:44) My favorite subject is the second thing communication. Um so obviously you know I view my job (0:10:51) as a Bitcoin Treasury CEO is you know the best job in the world and I'm incredibly grateful to everyone that (0:10:58) allows me to do this. Um but communication isn't um it isn't a (0:11:03) secondary thing to the job. It is the job. Um it's not something that you should view as a chore or anything like (0:11:09) that. I write an update to our shareholders. I actually write it on a Friday, but I put it out on a Saturday (0:11:14) morning. Um Jesse, who who works alongside me, we counted in in July, we (0:11:20) did 70 YouTube uh appearances in one calendar month, you know, together. Um (0:11:26) you know, communication is the best bit about the job, but it's also what your your investors want. Um maybe when we (0:11:33) get much much bigger there'll be more one-on-one communication with much much larger institutions but we'll still (0:11:39) always communicate with the retail shareholders and they are the people that have got us to you know where we (0:11:44) are today. Um so yeah I would I would do everything (0:11:50) honestly um and with transparency there. And then finally the third point which you know you probably don't want to hear (0:11:56) too much about is the regulation point. So, we're lucky in the UK that it's a very uh relatively open uh environment. (0:12:05) Some of my friends that run these companies in other parts of the world, you know, it's harder for them. Um but (0:12:10) anyone involved in the space, I view our jobs as helping the regulators understand things better. Um just like (0:12:17) we try and make everyone understand Bitcoin better, you know, it's our jobs to convince the doubters on the (0:12:22) regulation side that that they're wrong. Um, (0:12:27) and then finally, um, the thing that I'd like to stress, and I touched on it (0:12:33) earlier, is that, you know, being a Bitcoin treasury company isn't a shortcut to performance. You know, take (0:12:39) your time. Obviously, focus on Bitcoin yield, but take your time and get it (0:12:44) right. If if if we all do this together and we do it in the right way, you know, I believe there'll be thousands and (0:12:50) thousands and thousands of these companies. I believe almost every company, private and public, will have some degree of Bitcoin on the balance (0:12:57) sheet. But that's what I'd say. I'd say, you know, go as fast as you can, but, you know, please please get it right. (0:13:03) And if anyone ever needs any help, then, you know, just ping me an email or something and, you know, I I'll do my (0:13:09) best to help if if that's asked of me. [Applause]

**Boyd Cohen:**
(0:13:20) Boyd Cohen - Arcadia Bitcoin in Mexico (0:13:20) First of all, I'm I'm upset with Ed and Tim for not giving us a memo that all speakers had to wear a suit with an (0:13:25) orange tie. We didn't do that, but at least all three of us didn't do that. Um, it's an honor to be on this (0:13:32) particular panel. Uh, I've been following what Andrew's been doing with Smarter Web for a while. Uh, as uh (0:13:39) Eleanor mentioned, uh, I'm the COO of Arcadia Bitcoin. We're a new treasury (0:13:45) company in Mexico. Ed Jelene recently joined our team. All of you know who Ed is. Um I'll give you a bit of a (0:13:52) background on Mexico and a bit on what we've been doing. Uh so um similar to (0:13:58) some of Paul's background context, obviously most of you in here are I think are Americans, some Europeans, but (0:14:05) uh and beyond. But obviously we all have some familiarity with Mexico usually on the beaches. Uh, Mexico's 15th largest (0:14:14) GDP country in the in the world. 130 million people in Mexico. Mexico is a (0:14:20) gateway not just to the US, but to Spanish-sp speakaking Latin America. 450 million people live in Latin American (0:14:28) speak Spanish. So outside of Brazil, um (0:14:33) there is $350 billion in tied up in pension funds in Mexico that have a lot (0:14:40) of restrictions around investing in foreign capital markets but limited opportunity in in uh domestic markets. (0:14:48) Uh they're currently returning around 6% per year. M2 growth is 10% a year in (0:14:55) Mexico. uh the $700 billion in domestically owned treasury instruments, (0:15:02) hundred billion more in money markets. So that's if you're doing the math, over a trillion dollars of trap capital, (0:15:08) primarily institutions. Uh there is a grassroots Bitcoin (0:15:13) community in Mexico that's really interesting, emerging in a lot of the different communities. I live in Monterey, which is the second largest (0:15:20) city in Mexico outside of the Sudai Mexico. Um, Ed and I are both bilingual (0:15:27) in Spanish if you didn't know that. So, we're the two gringoes on the team, but but we speak Spanish and we eat Mexican (0:15:32) food all the time. Um, our company, Arcadia, was previously (0:15:39) known as Capital X. Has a 8-year track record, but unlike most every other (0:15:45) treasury company in the market, we're actually a Bitcoin company. The other day I heard uh Jack Mullers uh asked (0:15:52) about 21 and they said tell us about the treasury company. He said we're not a (0:15:57) treasury company. We're a Bitcoin company with a proactive LBE uh Bitcoin (0:16:03) treasury strategy. And that's how we define ourselves. So I joined only (0:16:08) months ago. The company was formed by two cipher punks back in 2017. have been (0:16:14) servicing uh Bitcoin brokerage, Bitcoin back lending. Uh we have a debit card, (0:16:21) we have a DCA coming very soon now. Uh we have some support for institutions (0:16:28) OTC and otherwise. Uh our underlying business model generates Bitcoin (0:16:34) organically. We are a native Bitcoin company pursuing an aggressive Bitcoin (0:16:39) treasury strategy. We are private. We're early. So been following Andrew and some (0:16:45) of the other uh earlier uh treasury companies that are gaining traction to learn from all them. So it's amazing (0:16:51) again to be on the stage with them. Uh we have our own custody inhouse within (0:16:56) 30 days. We'll be publishing our proof of reserves. Uh we offer custody for our institutional customers and our our (0:17:03) retail customers pretty soon. Uh our debit card will soon have a a BTC cash back. So kind of like fold. We have a (0:17:10) growing lending business that's kind of like Leen. Uh so we are aimed to be the (0:17:16) place to go for institutions and retail investors uh in the Bitcoin community. (0:17:22) Whether you want to be on the Bitcoin self-custody or you want to be in uh the (0:17:28) investment or both and we see a lot of synergy with both. We aim to tokenize our securities and allow pathways for (0:17:35) our investors to migrate their securities into our app to then leverage (0:17:41) for Bitcoin back lending etc. So you can envision all kinds of pathways for (0:17:46) synergy amongst them. And with that uh we're opening to questions. Thank you. (0:17:51) [Applause]

**Tim Kotzman:**
Thank you very much with the focus on (0:17:58) you know the challenges in new markets. Any questions, comments? Anyone I can throw the mic to here? Anybody? Anybody? (0:18:06) Got one back there.

**Audience Member:**
(0:18:12) Hey guys. Um, so first and foremost, thanks so much for that intro. Um, you guys mentioned that, you know, part of (0:18:18) this challenge is kind of, you know, educating these new populations that maybe haven't had access. Um, and not (0:18:24) just that, but allowing equity investors in these markets access to Bitcoin through the Bitcoin treasury company or (0:18:31) through the Bitcoin company as opposed to SP holding spot Bitcoin. Can you guys just speak to that specifically?

**Boyd Cohen:**
(0:18:39) I I'll start. Uh, one thing that's fascinating, so we're we're a Bitcoin company and so we struggle with this too (0:18:45) when we think about the treasury side and like are we discouraging people retail investors from holding spot (0:18:52) bitcoin and self custody which is something our underlying business has been doing for a year supporting that (0:18:59) there's a couple things first of all in Mexico I didn't mention it's really interesting um there's a tax arbitrage (0:19:05) for retail so they retail investors can pay up to 35% % capital gain on the sale (0:19:11) of spot bitcoin, but they're capped at 10% on the sale of equities and and uh (0:19:17) public instruments. So, what we see is that it's very easy (0:19:24) for all of us sort of core bitcoiners to like put everyone in a pigeon hole and (0:19:29) say everyone needs to buy all of their Bitcoin and hold in self-custody. But what is that 5% of the current Bitcoin (0:19:36) held in the world is held that way. We have to meet people where they are to help them on their Bitcoin journey. And (0:19:42) our vision is all right, you can if you're not totally orangepilled and but (0:19:48) you want to get exposure to Bitcoin, well, we can enable that through our public instruments. As you get orange (0:19:55) peeled, we have a vehicle to tokenize those instruments and you can bring those into our app and start learning to (0:20:00) down to to actually engage with Bitcoin in a more personal way. And and the my my core uh takeaway from this is we have (0:20:09) to meet people where they are, whether they're institutions, whether they're small business, or whether retail. And (0:20:15) if we only have one view of the only way to own and and engage with Bitcoin is holding itself custody, we're not going (0:20:22) to orange pill the world the way we want to. The way to do it is give them a range of options, optionality. let them (0:20:29) enter where they're ready and comfortable and over time they will orange pill and also engage in spot bit (0:20:35) Bitcoin and maybe still hold our equities.

**Andrew Webley:**
I can add to that as well that um you (0:20:40) know in the UK we've got a similar situation you know slightly different but broadly the same. Um you know I hold (0:20:48) almost 100% of everything that I've got in the world in Bitcoin or Bitcoin treasury companies. Um, and for me, as (0:20:56) controversial as as it is, and hopefully none of you will sort of come and hit me afterwards, um, Bitcoin treasury (0:21:03) companies, well, when run wellrun, offer something that's better than Bitcoin. You know, if we all agree that Bitcoin (0:21:09) is the best asset in the world, then you know, how do you get better than that? Well, the answer is very simple. It's (0:21:14) compound Bitcoin. And that's what we offer, you know, through Bitcoin yield. Um, and if you think about it in terms (0:21:21) of the securitization of Bitcoin, which is ultimately what we're all doing here, you know, in different degrees, um, (0:21:27) creating different products for different needs. Um, for my personal need, what do I need? Well, I want the (0:21:34) performance of Bitcoin, but I'd like more. Um, so a Bitcoin treasury company (0:21:40) is is an alternative to people that see the value of Bitcoin, but want something (0:21:45) maybe more volatile, for example. Um but you you Bitcoin in itself doesn't offer (0:21:51) compound returns you know. Yeah.

**Audience Member:**
(0:21:57) I have a question for Andrew as a new IPO in UK market. Can you speak up a little? (0:22:00) Growth opportunities to acquire profitable operating business in the UK (0:22:03) As a new IPO in UK market looking at growth opportunities. (0:22:09) how easy or difficult it can be for UK (0:22:14) company to acquire a new operating profitable business and or acquire a new (0:22:21) uh struggling treasury company in UK.

**Andrew Webley:**
Yeah. Okay. So, um there's a couple of (0:22:27) questions in that really. Um so, if the question is how easy is it to an IPO a (0:22:33) business in the UK, it's pretty easy actually. um you can see that there's you know 25 that you know sort of (0:22:40) pivoted or IPOed after us. You know it's not it's not that hard if you know what you're doing and there's lots of people (0:22:46) that can help with that. Um and then what you need to do is you need to get the structure right. Um so you know one (0:22:53) of the things that I was very keen on was you know making sure that the structure was you know compliance within (0:23:00) the regulations. You know clearly that's important. Um, so I IPOed my business, (0:23:06) which is a small business with a Bitcoin treasury policy. And it's as simple as that really. Then once you're listed, (0:23:15) the final part of the question in terms of, you know, acquiring other companies, (0:23:20) we can acquire whatever we want. So I'm building a balance sheet on the best (0:23:26) asset in the world for the future. And then probably not in the next week but in the next 3 months, 6 months, 12 (0:23:33) months etc. you know we will roll out that policy that's been clearly stated (0:23:38) since the outset the acquisition strategy using the strength of our balance sheet to acquire the right (0:23:44) opportunities. What's the right opportunity? Very simple. Basically anything that will deliver value for our (0:23:50) shareholders. Um, so I don't see right (0:23:55) now today us acquiring another Bitcoin treasury company today, but I wouldn't (0:24:02) be surprised if in the next 3 months, 6 months, not necessarily in the UK. Um, (0:24:08) then that might be good and that would be a good thing for those other companies, you know, it would aggregate (0:24:14) companies together, you know, and continue our mission. So, so yeah, hope that answers the question.

**Paul Lee:**
Um, if I may (0:24:22) answer that gentleman's question, um, as it applies to Korea, because I think it's important, um, I 100% echo what (0:24:27) Andrew and and Boyd said. I think the role important role of a treasury company, um, in each capital market is (0:24:35) to basically amplify access to to Bitcoin and Bitcoin backed um, products. (0:24:40) In Korea, there are only five crypto exchanges. One of them is Upit that has (0:24:46) a 70% market share. And what Korean government did is basically pair each (0:24:51) one of the five with a bank in Korea. So in order to open a bank open an account (0:24:57) with these crypto exchanges, you have to open an account with these banks first. (0:25:03) Um so if you're not if you haven't, you know, used that bank before, doesn't matter. You have to go to the bank and (0:25:08) and open open that account. Some of them are just pure internet banks that don't (0:25:14) have any offline, you know, branches. you have to go on online and and and (0:25:19) open an account, which is very hard for, for example, my seven-year-old dad, (0:25:25) right? He trades stock all the time. That's that's basically his hobby. Um, and you know, he's interested in crypto. (0:25:32) He's interested in Bitcoin, Ethereum. Um, I've been trying to orange pill him for for a while. He I know he is never (0:25:40) going to actually go to a bank um by himself, a bank that he never used to (0:25:45) open an account uh to buy Bitcoin. Um and but it is going to be very easy for (0:25:53) him to basically buy equity uh Bitcoin treasury equities um my company Bitpet (0:25:58) or um you know Micro Strategy in the US. So I think in that sense we're (0:26:04) definitely opening up the market by you know uh you know by a big margin uh to (0:26:11) uh to retail investors, institutional investors uh to this new product called Bitcoin and also Bitcoin backed uh (0:26:18) securities and and credit products.

**Tim Kotzman:**
Let's go to you, Chimch. (0:26:27) [Music] (0:26:38) Bitcoin as a tool for financial inclusion throughout Latin America

**Audience Member:**
(0:26:41) as a tool for financial inclusion throughout Latin America.

**Boyd Cohen:**
Yeah, thank you Cesar for the question. (0:26:48) I could answer that in Spanish, but Ed would get mad at me. So, um, there's (0:26:53) over 50% just over 50% of the Mexican population is unbanked, which is hard to (0:26:58) believe. It's a pretty developed country. You might have a view of Mexico outside of beaches. It's a lot of (0:27:03) poverty, but I live in what is actually the highest GDP per capita municipality (0:27:10) in all of Latin America in Monterey, Mexico. It's beautiful. Um, yet we have (0:27:16) a lot of inequality like we see around the world and we certainly have it around Mexico and around Latin America, (0:27:22) Argentina, Venezuela, my wife is Venezuelan. Um Bolivia, a lot of you (0:27:28) probably heard what happened very recently with Bolivia around US dollars. Looked a lot like what US did with uh (0:27:34) gold uh decades ago. So we are this is the interesting thing (0:27:40) about Bitcoin in Latin America and Mexico is that there is significant (0:27:46) demand at a grassroots level. you see a lot of these Bitcoin circular economies (0:27:51) in Mexico, in Argentina, in uh El Salvador, in many communities where (0:27:58) they're starting to use Bitcoin with or without government involvement whatsoever. Um so in Mexico, what we (0:28:07) have is significant recognition that money is broken and a desire to have (0:28:14) something better. in communities where people are unbanked or underbanked that includes small business. They're on (0:28:21) boarding to Bitcoin. We actually have a service for them too for uhmemes that actually want to uh receive payment in (0:28:28) Bitcoin. So there's growing pent-up demand at the lower levels. What we see (0:28:33) is a real gap at the institutional level. The central bank doesn't get it yet. The large existing publicly traded (0:28:41) companies don't get it at all. I spoke to a guy used to be governor of the me board of Mexico. He said he he said he's (0:28:48) on five major boards and he hasn't heard Bitcoin referenced once on any meeting (0:28:54) with a bank board with a major construction company uh board and many others. Uh so it's not on their radar (0:29:02) yet. You know problem and opportunity. We see it as a great opportunity is we're we're the first in the market (0:29:08) Bitcoin Native and Bitcoin Treasury in Mexico. Opportunities are big.

**Tim Kotzman:**
