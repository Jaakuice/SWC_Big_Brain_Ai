(0:00:00) Vostra here. Welcome back. If you're not subscribed to the channel by now, subscribe. You don't want to miss daily share price action updates in SWC land. Lot happens in SWC. How we all feeling today. Let's see. Markets just closed. Um I'm going to flick to the uh I use ADVF and I'm I get tired of Aquis. So the price closing price. Let's get rid of the ad. Looks like it's 3 pound30. So 11% up almost on on yesterday. Uh if you look back at some of the other videos we're doing, I'll try and coordinate so that they're all kind of nicely arranged so we can track these one day when we look back at all these videos. We'll be saying, "Yeah, we recorded it from the start." It's going to it's going to be valuable. Very valuable. And thanks for everyone for joining on the journey as well. So3 pound30 and we uh let me get the share price chart up SWC. So we've been saying in the previous videos as I was um mentioning just there that we should be expecting us to sort of hover around for a few days. Um yesterday we had the announcements about the ATM 7 million shares sold in the market. Um, we also now know that there's 14 million more shares in in um being placed in the ATM. So, the ATM is in action.

**Vostra:**
(0:01:30) And um one of the things I was looking at whilst just checking the closing price. Let's have a quick look through some of the trades. This is interesting. So we can see we can see we can see decent buy volume very decent buy volume across that activity. Um what I wanted to show you was you see these kind of round number clips sales and yesterday we closed around £3 if I um I believe so. What can happen now with the 14 million shares in in um in placement is that those can be sold above the previous day's closing price only a certain volume u 20% if I'm not mistaken and that that means that there's money being printed in in effect um you can see these round numbers 7,000 7,000 yes you'll have them on the other side as well 10,000 for me those sort of round numbers it's like like institutions or funds. Um because yeah, you can obviously tell retail is probably a little bit more like when you go and buy some shares as retail, you you don't do it in such nice round numbers, do you? Um could be wrong. We like entertaining ourselves. Um so yeah, I just wanted to point that out because this you add all of these puzzles together, right? Great interview today by Jesse. We'll um watch out for a new video I've I've done as well on that dropping tomorrow. Um we can see that this capital plan is progressing in a way that is um yeah it's trackable, right? It's mathematics. It's a capital plan. We keep talking about the capital plan. Um so ticking up nicely there.

**Vostra:**
(0:03:00) Just uh this is what they call the Fibonacci. no way a a chartist. There are so many good people on the community that are doing excellent analytics on this, but you can see it right. This has been bouncing around the 0.618 in and and up to the 0.5. Um that was 2.90 the last book build. Uh we're edging towards the the 3.54 mark and that would take us to this green line. The last book build was at 2.90 as we've just said. and let's let's take all of that knowledge and we always flick back through to our model and track what the latest MNAV is. Um some great comments on MNAV earlier today in the interview. We'll do a bit more on MNAV. Um let's flick to the SWC live model. This is what you get when you follow the channel. Subscribe, like. Uh one of the comments actually that Jesse made was and this highlighted how niche this still is. um even amongst the community is that if you think about it, MetaPlanet shareholders still don't know that SWC exists. Yeah, think about that. I'm pretty sure Jesse said something like that and uh that blew me away because that just exactly tells you how early this is.

**Vostra:**
(0:04:30) Um so what I've done what I do here on a daily basis is we check the uh share price activity and we track it to the MNAV. Um so currently uh it's trading at about three uh 6.5 MNAV and we we corroborate that and double check that with the smarter dashboard which you can access from um the the website investors.smart smarter web company analytics. Um, again, yeah, slightly cut off there, but that's fine. 6.74 the dashboard there is showing. That's good. So, we're in line. 325. So, 6.5. So, as I was saying, we don't actually need to get all the way back up to 10. Um because if we notice the target from Tennyson and I've got the Tennyson paper as well. We can have a quick look through there. We are tracking actually in in line very much with what the statistics are showing on MNAV and how that comes down over time. So let me show you and I've showed you this before in another video uh the work done by Micro Strategist. Um you say see the decay in the MNAV from when the uh strategy starts starts somewhere around the 20 20ish mark and then as time goes on the MNAV comes down. So we're between let's let's check what day we are. Um the ATM it's approximately 73 days since the start. Uh this model a version of this I should say is available um on on on the page. If you click on it you can get access the 73 days is between the 50 and 100. So that's about halfwayish roughly through there. And you can see where are we going? eight and a bit between eight and and 10. Doesn't quite get to 10. So, with that knowledge, let's do some number plugging. Uh, cheers Ollie for your comments around adapting this. I do like the way I control it through MNAV, though, I must admit. Um, I don't actually mind not inputting the share price in in in in the cell. So, this is all automated. If you're new to the channel, this is all we're driving the mnav, controlling the mnav, the multiple. This is is core and central to everything. Without the mnav, you you can't accrete uh positively the uh 6.5 there, right?

**Vostra:**
(0:07:00) So, let's let's see the tennyson target. Now, I want to refresh your memories to tennyson. Um these guys equity research team Tennyson securities they wrote this paper on let's see now 26th of June so it's um Alan Howitt CFA right CFAs are usually good at doing valuation analysis far better than I am I trust me on that one um so it's really interesting to to map their work against uh the models that we're building here because let's take a look at the you can download this from uh the smarter website. They have a threemonth target and425 p per share 47% above the current level. That was I think that was the book build 2.90 they're talking about. So they'd maintain their buy by buy by by recommendation. So let's see where 4 pound25 gets us in this game game plan. Um take a look at that that this is a very good paper. It explains a lot about the the model, the yield, the BTC per share, everything that we talk about here. Um so yeah the the target4 pound4 pound 25 and if you type in here8.54 8.54 yeah we get to there there thereabouts. Um so we don't need to get to 10. That's what I'm trying to say. Th this MNAV here is aligning very well with the uh work done by Micro Strategist. Big shout out to Micro Strategist for collecting all this data. We can model this. Uh so it'll be interesting to see if there is any further fund uh raising activity this this week. But safe to say there is the ATM that's printing.

**Vostra:**
(0:09:00) Um and I I can almost feel it here. You can see like there are there's obviously buys um round number buys on this side as well and those late late they post them late 238 338 markets just closed. So look at all these clips 10,000 10,000 10,000 10 what do you think those are? Could they be sales for the ATM? I mean this is fundraising. This is money printing. This is more bitcoins per share coming shortly. Get get a ticket for the train. That's what Jesse said. Uh, good stuff. Right, let's um keep this moving. Let's go next to our agenda here. 14 million. So, we talked about that Q&A. Actually, before we do a bit of Q&A, let's um see what's happening in SWC World on the uh community page. Go there, subscribe, you get the latest alpha. Uh, what's John saying? The beat the denominator. Fastest horse. Why this UK Bitcoin company could be the next Metlanet? We just said Metaplanet doesn't even know we exist. I mean, when people find out about this stock, it could, you know, the train might have left the station, but right now, get get on board. Um, Andrew Webbley, I'll be talking at the Bitcoin Treasuries Digital Conference tonight. What would tune in for that? So much going on. You get you get into divorce situations if you keep up with everything. Um, what else? Anyone know time? Yeah, the time presenting there 7:30. I don't know exact times. Look at all this. Everyone's analyzing everything. All the models. Jesse Meyers, great interview earlier today. Um, great stuff. Hey, the zincs, I can hear the ATM working. Oh, we can all hear it working. Expect the 14 million shares to get through faster than Yeah, this thing we we've modeled our we've sandbagged the model. This ATM could be done very very soon. um you know we've said ATM 2 three this is a heavily sandbagged situation or I I think you know on average it will work out because we've spread out all of the sort of fundraising um so comfortable with the model but yeah like Zinc says he can hear the ATM working we we're all watching this expect another bit Bitcoin big Bitcoin buy all working perfectly great comment um what Nice.
