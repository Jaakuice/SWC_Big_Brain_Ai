**Tim Kotzman:**
(0:00:00) Intro Welcome back to the Bitcoin Treasuries podcast. I'm Tim Cottsman. I'm here with Jesse Meyers, the head of Bitcoin (0:00:07) Strategy at the Smarter Web Company. Andrew Webbley, the CEO at the Smarter (0:00:13) Web Company, and Sandra Anderson, the co-founder and executive chairman at (0:00:18) H100 Group. So, Sandra, right before this, we were talking uh now no longer CEO. So, what (0:00:21) Sander's H100 Group Announcement (0:00:25) what is the announcement there? I wanted to know.

**Sander Andersen:**
Yeah, basically um I brought in (0:00:30) a lot of our biggest um shareholders and um so it was very natural for me now (0:00:37) when the company has gone from zero to thousand bitcoin to be steering the whole strategy of of the whole company (0:00:44) trusted by the biggest shareholders. So and by Swedish law you can't hold both positions. So therefore like when you (0:00:50) step up you will still be in the same position um in executive daily role. So (0:00:56) nothing has changed there. Um, but it was yeah by shareholder demand.

**Tim Kotzman:**
(0:01:02) Pretty cool. What was the impetus? I like to use (0:01:05) How Andrew & Sander connected over X (0:01:07) fancy words. I think that's the right one in this context. What what's the whole reason that we're here today? What (0:01:13) happened on X that can Can somebody tell us that story?

**Andrew Webley:**
Yeah, sure. So, um I think it was a (0:01:20) month or so ago. I remember I was on holiday at the time and um the community (0:01:25) on X said something about you know you know smarter web or H100 and they said (0:01:32) you know we should chat you know and and you know maybe film it for for everyone. So um I can't remember whether it was (0:01:39) you reached out to me or I reached out to you but within minutes we we thought well we're both in New York so let's do (0:01:46) this. It's very interesting when you talk about a lot of the CEOs in this industry. We we all know each other (0:01:52) quite well and we yeah we we called each other and and asked the question direct which is quite unique for this industry (0:01:58) which I very much like and the event yesterday was another brilliant example of how this industry is working (0:02:04) different from many others and it's great as well because you know (0:02:09) sometimes times are good sometimes things are tough you know we're all busy we're all doing different things and to (0:02:15) have the support from each other is you know it's it's pretty cool actually

**Jesse Myers:**
agree It it was a cool example of how (0:02:22) Bitcoin Twitter, Bitcoin X, whatever you want to call it, is really like instrumental to how this this landscape (0:02:28) is evolving and, you know, the companies are listening to investors on Twitter (0:02:35) and and paying attention to the you know, what what what do you guys think we should do and who should we talk to (0:02:42) and what kind of conversations should we have? And you know it's it's it's a (0:02:47) privilege to be part of an industry where there's u you know mutual respect and we're really kind of we're all (0:02:54) rowing in the same boat you know trying to do achieve the same goals. Um and and (0:02:59) then you know we're all in New York at the same time because of the absolutely excellent uh Bitcoin unconference (0:03:05) yesterday here in New York City planned in how how long? Like six weeks roughly six weeks. Yeah.

**Tim Kotzman:**
And I was uh I (0:03:12) was talking to Adrian who who produced the show and uh um I realized I I I (0:03:18) can't recall a single hiccup that I noticed. So that's pretty incredible and fantastic production value. Uh and all (0:03:24) the best Bitcoin treasury minds all in one stage in the round. Um and it was it (0:03:30) was really a wonderful event. So thank you for putting it together.

**Jesse Myers:**
Thank you. Yeah, we were really really really happy with how it turned out and (0:03:37) and lots of great feedback. So, yeah, this is uh just the beginning. So, yeah, (0:03:42) we're we're really excited.

**Tim Kotzman:**
Yeah. Well, um yeah, what what should we what should we dive into next then? (0:03:48) This is my co-host, Jesse Meyers, and uh we're going to be interviewing (0:03:53) round table, I guess. Round table.

**Andrew Webley:**
I can make a suggestion. you know from the conference why don't (0:04:00) Takeaways from the Bitcoin Treasuries Unconference (0:04:00) we go about talking about the best bits of the conference or key takeaways you (0:04:05) know one two things that you know we thought were particularly you know interesting in terms of subject matter (0:04:11) because obviously everyone can see the the the the show on the the internet but (0:04:17) maybe you know one thing that you particularly liked from it

**Sander Andersen:**
I think that the industry is now (0:04:22) evolving very very quickly and what surprised me that we're already now at (0:04:28) the stage where we're discussing how this is forming a new industry and each individual Bitcoin treasury company will (0:04:35) design products around that specific market they are in and add additional shareholder value um more than only (0:04:42) issuing new shares to buy more Bitcoin and convertible bonds to to buy new Bitcoin and that's quite clear for me (0:04:48) now that we start to think about this is the new Rockefeller or in Norway we have lots of great shipping guys and energy (0:04:56) guys and fisheries that have done this commodity businesses and for me it's (0:05:01) very clear that this is going to be a commodity business um that you have (0:05:07) management companies on top and what they do they accumulate as much um of (0:05:13) their preferred commodity which we all try to collect which is bitcoin and on (0:05:19) top of that you can issue multiple products and I don't think we have seen (0:05:24) uh 1% of the business models that would be created on top. And I think when that's (0:05:32) uh basically sailor's pitch, I think we all will work quite hard to to figure out what what we can do. And that was my (0:05:40) main takeaway from the the content. And again, it was a reminder of what the (0:05:47) truly unique community this is and how much like a digital platform like X can (0:05:53) connect people all around the world and you basically enter a conversation in two seconds like you know each other (0:05:59) very well and you never met them but you have spoken to them multiple times online and I think that's such a unique (0:06:06) industry and it's such a new characteristic that we haven't seen before and maybe the first global market (0:06:13) ever uh where you have like shareholders from all around the world trying to (0:06:18) access your German ticker or your US OTC ticker. It's such a interesting vibe and (0:06:24) unique community.

**Andrew Webley:**
Yeah, I I um you know, just to pick up on your ex point, you (0:06:29) know, one of the things that I love about doing this job is that you know, it's not only can we all reach out to (0:06:35) each other, we can share each other's content, we can, you know, then go offline and and talk, but it allows us (0:06:41) to interact with the shareholders. you know, obviously not all the time because, you know, take the last few (0:06:47) days. You know, we've all been incredibly busy, working very, very long days. But, you know, the shareholders can actually post things direct to us. (0:06:54) And I think you're right. I don't think you've ever really seen that with public companies before that are truly um, you (0:07:03) know, engaging with their shareholders. And we often say that the great thing (0:07:08) about Bitcoin treasury companies is that, you know, it's one of the few things in capital markets where it comes (0:07:15) bottom up as opposed to top down. So the retail investors are first. They're leading the way with, you know, the the (0:07:21) the research, the analysis. Um, you know, in many cases, they're getting the (0:07:27) best deals, you know, the earliest deals. Um, and and normally with traditional finance, it's the other way (0:07:33) round. you know they often don't get you know to see things until the end whereas (0:07:38) you know we've been meeting you know different investors today um and you (0:07:44) know that's great and you know we've had some great conversations but you know the retail investors are understanding (0:07:49) this before the institutions and I think that's quite cool

**Jesse Myers:**
for me the biggest takeaway of the event so I've I've told (0:07:58) my story many many times about how um you know five and a half years ago whenever It was that, you know, I saw (0:08:05) Sailor put Bitcoin and a public company together. Um, and it was really (0:08:11) interesting for me because the last 5 months, you know, since being listed have been, you know, fairly fullon. Um, (0:08:18) and to see Michael Sailor talking and to say that this is the first year of this (0:08:24) new industry made me think for a minute, well, you know, we've had some great times with the share price. we've you (0:08:30) know obviously you know suffered the you know the MNAV contraction that you know many companies have seen recently and (0:08:36) then to take a step back for a moment and to think hang on a minute you know this is just year one you know even (0:08:43) though the models existed for five plus years you know really as all of us doing these things in similar ways and (0:08:50) different ways you know we are only at the start so the old overused phrase of (0:08:56) you know we're early etc um as I like to say you we're only just getting started. (0:09:01) It's It's true. And I think that was quite cool.

**Jesse Myers:**
Yeah, it was really cool. I I loved how (0:09:07) Sailor articulated that in a way that that people haven't really that we are in year one of a new industry. And um a (0:09:14) few months ago, I I went through the exercise really of trying to figure out like how how big is this? At the time, (0:09:21) we weren't really thinking of it as an industry and like how big is this opportunity for Bitcoin treasury companies? how how big will this be for (0:09:28) Bitcoin? Uh, and you know, I kind of did some back of the envelope math and in in (0:09:33) the in the way that I was trained in management consulting and um thinking through the sort of logic of like how (0:09:40) Bitcoin treasury companies are the entities that are equipped to go create the products that appeal to various (0:09:47) buckets of capital in the world. Fixed income market, equity markets, the money market, maybe real estate one day. We'll (0:09:53) see what sort of products get created. Um, and thinking through that, I I realized that these are going to be the (0:10:00) the biders when Bitcoin's at $5 million a coin because strategy and hopefully (0:10:07) our our companies um will have unlocked the next trillion dollars of fixed (0:10:12) income by offering them 10%. Uh, you know, and and taking that (0:10:18) capital and buying Bitcoin with it, knowing that it's going to appreciate at 30 to 50% a year. uh and that if this (0:10:26) process plays out for 10 20 years uh these entities will accumulate a huge (0:10:32) portion of all the bitcoin and you know maybe as much as half of all the bitcoin (0:10:38) and using sailor's numbers of you know $13 million per coin in 20 years that (0:10:43) would mean that these entities would accumulate $140 trillion worth of bitcoin (0:10:49) uh which you know that's that makes it the biggest industry in the world by value and then now we're talking about (0:10:55) an industry, right? And and so that kind of hit me like a ton of bricks when I did that exercise a few months ago and (0:11:03) and and it's an industry. It's just it's just so early it's hard to see it. And I think yesterday it was a lot easier to (0:11:10) see that this is the a budding industry. You had 190,000 people tuned in at the (0:11:16) at the peak of the live stream. And Mike Germano from uh PubK had a great point (0:11:22) that um that's more viewership than any show on NBC has, MSNBC has. Uh and and (0:11:30) that's quite a quite an achievement for the first go of a of a media format and (0:11:35) I think speaks to like the the the bubbling in interest and enthusiasm and value that that people are realizing is (0:11:43) here in this new industry.

**Sander Andersen:**
Yeah. And I I think we are actually like rebooting uh the public market. Um the (0:11:51) last two decades it's all been private um private market funds um private equity venture capital and I I think (0:11:59) we're like close between seven and eight seven and eight years from the founding (0:12:04) of a company before they go public. So the value creation of most companies happens in the private market that are (0:12:11) not accessible to normal people. a Bitcoin treasury company, they go public (0:12:16) day one, which basically makes you um like everyone have the opportunity to be part (0:12:23) of the value creations from day one. Like in venture capital, it's only very (0:12:28) very wealthy LPS or angel investors with a lot of network that can do that. And I (0:12:34) think that's that's truly unique and that makes it very like that it has this (0:12:40) virality built in that will reboot. And I think most of the alpha in the in (0:12:45) finance over the next uh two decades will come from public markets. (0:12:50) And I due to um Bitcoin treasury companies. And I think when you can buy (0:12:58) things through your Bloomberg terminal, you attract a lot of capital and a lot of these fintech platforms makes it very (0:13:05) easily available for everyone and X makes it very easy to give feedback. So (0:13:11) we listen to the community. We see direct effect on the share price if we do something wrong and we have to fix it (0:13:17) and we have to go out there and speak. It's not enough anymore to get like one shareholder update a month. So I (0:13:25) completely agree with you and I think it's such a fascinating industry now (0:13:31) that reboots public market. Um and again I think the products we are going to go (0:13:38) forward is going to it's going to be so much variability in what type of (0:13:44) products you succeed as a bit with as a Bitcoin treasury company going forward.

**Jesse Myers:**
Yeah. The uh that was the other insight (0:13:50) that that I thought was really cool from Sailor speaking yesterday. He he talked about um how there will be Bitcoin (0:13:59) treasury companies that focus on different little niches. Uh, and you know, I've had we've talked about um, (0:14:07) you know, there's going to be a sort of win or take most in in every capital market. I I think that's true. Um, maybe (0:14:13) it's maybe it's, you know, that there's a head and shoulders leader uh, however you want to say that basically the same (0:14:19) thing. But there's going to be opportunities for all sorts of different business models uh you know at the (0:14:25) periphery or sort of the maybe the the more niche uh capital pools that the (0:14:30) leading Bitcoin treasure company in that capital market doesn't quite focus on. Uh and there's going to be quite a quite (0:14:36) a bit of opportunities for specialization of of products and you (0:14:41) know particular market focuses um you know like insurance or you know (0:14:47) particular types of credit or maybe you focus on the money market and we're going to start to see all sorts of (0:14:53) variation in in that way. But I think you know for us the the big opportunity is be the leading Bitcoin treasury (0:14:58) company in your capital market and and then you get your your pick of the litter uh you know to start.

**Sander Andersen:**
(0:15:04) Yeah. I took sailor's advice yesterday and and tried to speak as much as I can with the AI and I asked the AI how big (0:15:13) is the private credit market and that's like 34 trillion dollars and they have (0:15:19) like 2% management fee 20% carry in that industry. Um and average yielding (0:15:25) product there is around 7 to 8%. That's like and you take a lot of (0:15:31) management risk when you do private credit. You basically like le leverage up companies in buying them and (0:15:38) restructuring them and try to buy sell them again. Um but here you have an opportunity like Sailor has showed us to (0:15:45) issue those kind of products with a completely different structure way simpler and you're tapping into a (0:15:51) private market of 3 to four trillion and I I see so many opportunities and I (0:15:57) agree with you down payment of Bitcoin into real estate uh credit card issued on your Bitcoin stack. So if you want to (0:16:03) buy a car, you don't want to sell your Bitcoin, but you have cash flow to pay, should be quite easy to issue like (0:16:09) liquidity to over like these Bitcoin credit cards. Um, and we have seen like (0:16:16) reward system with with Bitcoin. It it's so many things that Bitcoin uh is going (0:16:21) to be like packed into financial uh tools and yeah, we haven't seen like 1% of it.

**Jesse Myers:**
It it (0:16:28) it's it's funny to me how um you know what we're talking about is like rebuilding capital markets on a on a (0:16:34) different capital base and what that's going to amount to is over the next few decades like the the airplane is in (0:16:41) flight you know the global economy is in flight built with fiat parts and we will (0:16:47) be replacing one by one each of the parts while the airplane keeps flying with these Bitcoin products and um and (0:16:55) you know reshaping capital as we know it into a a a a plane built entirely of (0:17:02) Bitcoin era parts. Uh and it's going to be, you know, it's a once in a species (0:17:08) moment of us going from from analog capital to digital capital and a digital (0:17:15) capital structure for everything. It's going to be, you know, what a what an incredible opportunity to live through (0:17:21) that moment. And you know, if you're watching this now, you're paying attention at the start of this process (0:17:27) and we get to see it play out. It's pinch yourself stuff, you know.

**Andrew Webley:**
I think you're right because, you know, (0:17:34) in the UK, equity markets have been fairly poor for 10, 15 years, something (0:17:39) like that. You know, ever ever since the credit crunch really. Um, you know, there's been brief moments where they've (0:17:46) popped, but you know, on the whole, it hasn't been a great place to be an equity investor. And then when we IPOed (0:17:52) in in April this year, everyone's credited us with, you know, bringing the (0:17:57) equity markets back to life in the UK. They've it's become exciting the all the (0:18:03) different advisers, you know, whether it's the brokers, the auditors, the lawyers, you know, they're all getting (0:18:08) busier and busier with, you know, these different opportunities. And and one of the things that comes up quite a lot is, (0:18:15) you know, the argument of Bitcoin as a medium of an exchange or a store of (0:18:20) value. And, you know, clearly I'm very much on the store of value side. However, if you think about it over the (0:18:28) long term, you know, when we're rebuilding the public markets on Bitcoin, you know, that that's (0:18:34) definitely a contribution to the Bitcoin ecosystem. you know, if we replace, you know, the fiat currencies and it's not (0:18:42) just the base unit that they're measured in, but also the way they're transacted. You know, if you think about some of the (0:18:48) companies out there that are exploring the tokenization of securities, you know, this is a well, it's mind-blowing (0:18:55) really when you think about what the change could be. You know, far far far (0:19:00) more significant when you think about the flows of capital globally going through all the different public markets. You know, even think about (0:19:07) things like the international settlement system. You know, the reason why we as a business accepted Bitcoin as a payment (0:19:14) mechanism in 2023 was very much focused on international clients because it was (0:19:20) slow and expensive to get relatively small amounts of money paid from, you (0:19:26) know, the US to the UK or the Middle East to the UK. in and that was one of the main reasons why we started (0:19:33) accepting it as a payment mechanism. Um so yeah it's very exciting and and (0:19:39) slightly mind-blowing.

**Sander Andersen:**
It's definitely has like the main use case today store of value but if you try to transfer (0:19:46) money from US to to Sweden I can tell you that Bitcoin is way more efficient (0:19:51) uh payment method than going through banks. So, um I definitely see that (0:19:57) medium of exchange thing is happening on on the bigger like when you want to settle a billion dollar bitcoin might be (0:20:04) the most efficient way to do that. Um and it will potentially like going down down until the daily purchases like we (0:20:12) do in Lugano. I pay try to pay as least like five times a week with the Bitcoin (0:20:17) and the lightning system because it works very well. It's just like not broadly adopted yet.

**Andrew Webley:**
We had a um a (0:20:23) dinner the other evening and I at the end I said to everyone sitting around the table I said you know where do you (0:20:30) all sit on the store of value versus the medium of exchange and you know one of the people there said to me something (0:20:36) quite quite good which was he is very much on the store of value side but that (0:20:42) doesn't work without the ability to exchange the value without a counterparty so it's a bit of a hybrid (0:20:48) you know and we often say that some of the things that we'll do as a business longer term. We don't even know yet. Um, (0:20:56) you know, we've got our strategy for the next few years, but you know, in 10 years time, you know, it's it's (0:21:02) impossible to say some of the things that the business may evolve into. Um, and I think that's quite important um, (0:21:08) for people to sort of understand that a lot of the things that Bitcoin will be used for in the future may not be (0:21:16) evident at the moment in the same way that if we look back at the internet, (0:21:21) you know, in the late '9s, you know, some of the things that we do today with the internet, we wouldn't have thought (0:21:28) we would have done 25 years ago. Um, you know, so, so that's quite an interesting (0:21:34) perspective as well.

**Sander Andersen:**
Yeah, I I completely agree. I think at least in our organization, we think about it as (0:21:41) it's an asset play. You have to take care of your asset. You have to aggregate as much of the asset which is Bitcoin as possible and you use capital (0:21:49) architecture to to accomplish that in different formats. So, um I completely (0:21:56) agree with you um that we very very early and it's hard to say like where (0:22:02) are we going. It's matter of like how do you build your organization to have the skills that can tackle this super (0:22:09) volatile and super and you have to be super agile to to succeed here.

Um and (0:25:03) and maybe a note first. You said, you know, maybe a once a month update to shareholders. It's interesting in in the (0:25:11) traditional Tradfi world, you have uh the current US administration saying, (0:25:17) "Hey, instead of quarterly reports, maybe we'll just make it every six months." But I feel like with Bitcoin (0:25:22) Treasury companies, it's like 247 365 that to your points, you're you're (0:25:28) receiving information and you know, it might be a a pretty not constant, but uh (0:25:35) at any time it could be like plan, do, check, adjust, not once a quarter, but like once a day, once a week and and (0:25:42) just all those learnings compound upon themselves and right you have this digital capital and digital (0:25:48) distribution, whether it's investor relations or any type of communication. It's just interesting to to try to just (0:25:57) see how this can snowball. Um, how do the meetings here in New York (0:26:04) compare to the markets that you're working in? And (0:26:09) Andrew, you said, you know, no one knows what's going to be happening 10 years from now. Is there (0:26:16) anything that's surprised you recently that um you think would be valuable to share with the community?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:26:22) Yeah, I think all of the different markets, you know, where we go. Um you (0:26:27) know, so we've recently got back from Asia. You know, we met um a number of different investors, mostly sort of (0:26:33) family offices over there. Um in New York, it's mostly, you know, your more (0:26:39) traditional institutional investors and then obviously all sorts of different ones in the UK. Um I think they're all (0:26:47) at different stages in terms of understanding the Bitcoin Treasury model. Um clearly in the US they're more (0:26:53) advanced um at an institutional level. Um so there are similarities you know (0:26:59) albeit different points on on the life cycle. Um I think you know one thing (0:27:05) that you know everyone needs to be aware of is that different capital markets (0:27:10) have got different amounts of capital available to them. Um, so you you know, (0:27:16) a small investment from a a US firm may be a pretty big investment from a UK (0:27:21) firm. Um, you know, so there there's similarities, (0:27:26) but but they're different. Um the the main thing that I like about some of our (0:27:32) international investors on the institutional side is how more (0:27:39) more forward thinking they are in terms of they get the model. So you know we use the phrase compound Bitcoin all all (0:27:46) the time and um you know there's a lot less explanation of what that means and (0:27:51) how it works. still some of it. Um you know whereas you know in in the UK (0:27:57) there's more of that. Um that said um five months ago when we IPOed the (0:28:02) business um a lot of the institutional investors were um interested um but (0:28:08) extremely cautious and now in part I suppose because they've seen the model (0:28:14) work. You know we've proven the model to a degree you know albeit at a very early stage. Um so now the institutional (0:28:20) investors are getting a lot more interested. Um I think there's still other things that we need to do as a as (0:28:27) an industry to you know to explain it more. Um and you know when I think you (0:28:34) know where's this going to be even in a year's time it's you know again that's something that's quite mind-blowing you know because you know in well less than (0:28:42) half a year things have changed a lot in terms of the institutional appetite towards the model.

**Tim Kotzman:**
Just a quick note on (0:28:49) something incredible you just said, which is we proved it out over the past five months. Strategy has been proving (0:28:54) it out over the past five years.

**Andrew Webley:**
Yeah. Yeah. Specifically in the UK. Specifically in the UK because when we (0:29:00) listed the business, funnily enough, I I I said to everyone at the time, I (0:29:05) said, "Look, you know, this is what we're going to do. You know, you can see, you know, this has been going for 5 (0:29:11) years with strategy." Um, and then you know, one of our directors, Tyler, um, he's also on the board of MetaPlanet. (0:29:18) Um, so we were using MetaPlanet as an example to say, look, this is how it worked in Japan. You know, we haven't got this in the UK. This is what we're (0:29:25) going to do. This is how we're going to do it. Um, and even then with the case studies, you know, um, you know, for me (0:29:31) it was obvious because I've been investing in strategy since the start, but but but they didn't get it. The the (0:29:37) local side of things has to be communicated. Um I don't know why that (0:29:43) is like we're obviously you know all friends and we all live in different parts of the world. Um, so maybe we (0:29:49) think about it more in a global nature and you know a lot of the you know even even Bitcoin you know um I can't (0:29:56) remember who it was the other day um but they they said to me that they went to a um this is one of the other CEOs um they (0:30:04) went to an institutional investor meeting and you know they had to explain Bitcoin you know um you know so and and (0:30:11) that's okay um you know it maybe it's tiring if you've explained Bitcoin to people you know you hundreds and (0:30:18) hundreds of times. But, you know, that is part of the job. Um, and it's, you know, it it's understanding um that (0:30:25) different people um are at different stages of understanding it. You know, if (0:30:30) we want everyone in the world to adopt Bitcoin, then, you know, we all have to, you know, put the effort into, you know, (0:30:37) sort of getting them to uh getting them to understand it.

**Jesse Myers:**
And and I would add that, you know, the the the institutions (0:30:43) we're talking to are a tiny subset of global institutions and and that's (0:30:49) really because, you know, our our brokers uh people we get connected to the they're they're finding the people (0:30:57) who already are open to this, you know, what is broadly seen as a crazy fad or (0:31:05) some fringe idea that, you know, has no basis in reality. and and but but there are a a small percentage of institutions (0:31:12) have done enough homework or or have a open enough disposition to to see Bitcoin and you know understand there (0:31:19) must be some value here and maybe I should pay attention. Um all that to say that you know we're still very early in (0:31:26) the the the scurve of technology adoption. Uh institutions are in many (0:31:32) ways they they are committees and that means you need to get a a tipping point of individuals in an institution to (0:31:40) believe in Bitcoin and that means you're you're waiting for a a critical mass of (0:31:47) individuals to have done enough homework on Bitcoin and and you know go ask (0:31:52) anybody on the street what they think about Bitcoin. Nine times out of 10 they're they're you know you're going to sound like a crazy person. Um so and (0:32:00) that's true in institutions too and you got to get to some sort of critical mass um in any institution. All that to say (0:32:06) that you know it I think retail investors especially savvy you know bitcoin investors are surprised to (0:32:14) imagine that the institutions are behind them in understanding this but that's the reality and and that's because an (0:32:20) institution has a higher bar u you need more individuals (0:32:25) to get it than you know one individual getting it because they do their homework for themselves. Uh and and that (0:32:33) just is part of how early we are. Um you know, I think it's it's so easy for (0:32:39) Bitcoin investors and especially Bitcoin Treasury company investors to think uh you know, it's obvious. It should be (0:32:45) obvious. Everybody can see the value delivery that's that's uh being um you (0:32:51) know, created here. Uh but but that's not the case. And and that's like (0:32:58) exactly where you want to be. you want to be um shocked that more people don't (0:33:05) get it because it just means that the vast majority of people are are still still uh going to be woken up by what I (0:33:12) think is the economic reality of how much value is is delivered through (0:33:19) adding Bitcoin per share in this particular business model. Um, and you (0:33:25) know, we can talk about that versus traditional equities, but the cadence of it, the pace of it, the the sheer amount (0:33:32) of value that uh a well-run Bitcoin treasury company can deliver is so much (0:33:37) better than what you are going to get in traditional equities markets where you're paying 20, 30, 40 PE ratios. Uh, (0:33:44) and and you know, it's it's two or under for the equivalent P bid ratio. Mhm. (0:33:50) Um for a Bitcoin treasury company, ours are I think under a year, under half a (0:33:56) year even right now. Um and and I I think that's the reality is that (0:34:03) institutions don't know that yet. U most individuals don't know that yet. Most Bitcoiners don't know that yet. And it's (0:34:10) just really the pe the Bitcoiners who uh know enough about capital markets or finance and Bitcoin to have done their (0:34:18) homework on both to understand a Bitcoin treasury company and see the value delivery there. And that's a great place (0:34:25) to be because it's a tiny tiny slice of the world so far.

**Tim Kotzman:**
How much time do you spend discussing with them about that? (0:34:28) Discussing DATs with Investors (0:34:34) Well, so um over the last couple of days I suppose um you know the word that has (0:34:41) been used quite a bit.

**Andrew Webley:**
That was the same experience. I I actually learned the term here here in the US.

**Tim Kotzman:**
Yeah. So like so you are a that (0:34:49) what is a that?

**Andrew Webley:**
Well it is it's quite funny actually because you call me. (0:34:54) Yeah. Well when when we listed the business actually we had to use the phrase um digital asset treasury. Okay. (0:35:02) And it was only after about I think a month that the lawyers said you can call it a Bitcoin treasury. Um so um so yeah, (0:35:12) we do we do hear about it quite a bit. Um it comes up quite a bit on the panels (0:35:17) when we're talking as well. Um we we often hear the phrase shitcoin as well. (0:35:24) Um that comes up quite a bit when you bring it up at a Bitcoin event. rightly so uh in my opinion not wanting to (0:35:31) offend anyone of course um you know I personally believe that if you're (0:35:38) building a company with a large treasury you need a suitable treasury asset and (0:35:45) you know I don't believe that any other asset is suitable as a treasury than (0:35:51) Bitcoin so it's sort of maybe maybe it's (0:35:56) a slight sort of cliche in term a digital asset treasury as opposed to a bitcoin treasury but you know it does (0:36:03) come up quite a bit.

**Sander Andersen:**
Yeah. Okay. I must have lived in a bubble because I I hadn't heard it before and I (0:36:10) the third time I heard it I had what is a that sorry um (0:36:15) little did you know you were running a DAT um shitcoin I hear often but that's more (0:36:22) in the Bitcoin community. when we have spoken to to the institutions here um I think lots of the (0:36:29) discussions is around like okay it's new uh dats uh launching all the time and we (0:36:35) get access to to to go into at 1 mnav and and probably sell at 1.5 (0:36:44) and the counterargument for me is like okay I have thousand bitcoin if you give (0:36:49) me another thousand bitcoin I'm very close to one mnav when we close the deal Yeah. And then like the brain shift a little (0:36:55) bit. Okay. Because it's all about like how do you create the right capital architecture to ensure that you catch up (0:37:01) with that premium time to cover is is the phrase we use in our industry. But Eminem is very often used in (0:37:09) institutional um meetings. Time to cover is not yet there. Um and we we have (0:37:17) spent a lot of time trying to figure out what they're actually looking for. Is this like a long-term Bitcoin exposure? (0:37:24) Um, then you can design products that for example are dependent on the Bitcoin (0:37:29) price to convert. Like for example, we we are exploring with a a Bitcoin (0:37:34) denominated convertible bond where the price is determined by the Bitcoin price as well. So if our stock can't (0:37:41) outperform um the Bitcoin price, we can't convert them. That's interesting for some (0:37:48) investors. And someone else asked us, "But could could you um just hold my Bitcoin and I (0:37:56) get an equity kicker and I get a penalty if I draw them back?" Maybe that's interesting. I haven't looked too much (0:38:02) into it yet. And the third one is all about the fiat money that wants to come in to get Bitcoin exposure in a (0:38:09) structured way. So I I think that's what have been quite fascinating over the last couple of um now soon weeks here in (0:38:17) the US is that as long as you can take down the discussion into the single point of like how do you want exposure (0:38:24) to this asset class because if you don't want exposure I can just walk out of the room because that's the only thing I (0:38:30) promise that I will do my best for my shareholder is to increase Bitcoin per share. So has really opened up my mind (0:38:38) that it's so many ways people want exposure to Bitcoin. If it's Bitcoin (0:38:46) denominated exposure or if it's fiat denominated or if it's like income generating like an fixed income product (0:38:54) all these products has opened up my mind to think okay this is going to be how (0:38:59) Bitcoin treasury companies are generating the alpha compared to the underlying commodity of Bitcoin that we (0:39:05) all believe will go up over time. But if you basically like a passive ETF, you it (0:39:12) might be fair that you trade at MNAV one or actually below um MNAB 1, but that's (0:39:22) also fine for the industry because it's plenty of people uh or sorry plenty of companies with a premium that will more (0:39:30) than be more than happy to absorb your Bitcoin and (0:39:35) sorry to say fire the management.

**Andrew Webley:**
I'm looking forward to um the future in terms of what we all do together in (0:39:41) terms of trying to increase the use of the evolving industry metrics. Um (0:39:49) because I think you're right with things like like MNAV, you know, you can you can you know, if if you understand the (0:39:56) market, it's very easy to compare, you know, what seems to be like a cheap or an expensive Bitcoin treasury company. (0:40:02) And you know, our focus is on Bitcoin yield. You know, um you know, as as (0:40:07) you've done, you know, we've both achieved exceptional yield quarter to date. You know, in all honesty, for both (0:40:14) of us, slightly helped by the fact that we're at that particular stage in the life cycle, you know, like when you're (0:40:20) at 500, a,000, 2,000, 3,000 Bitcoin, it's easier to deliver that without (0:40:26) significant amounts of capital. Um not to say that we haven't achieved a good thing. Of course we have achieved a good (0:40:33) thing. You know to be fair it's the best in the world the two of us I think. Um but you know it is important to take it (0:40:40) in that context. Whereas then you've got some companies that you know perhaps (0:40:45) aren't delivering that yield and you know maybe they're getting um you know valued as if they are. So as we get (0:40:52) better as an industry with the stats um I think that that will be interesting. (0:40:57) But we we've done um so the vast majority of our treasury is from equity, (0:41:03) you know, pure equity. Um over 200 million pounds raised in uh 5 months. Um (0:41:09) true ATMs. Uh well actually probably 75% of it (0:41:14) comes from placements and subscriptions and 25% of it comes from the ATM. (0:41:20) Interestingly, um the ATM staff facility um off the top of my head's only been in (0:41:26) place for let's say 8 weeks. Um which, you know, if you think about what's happened to, you know, the global (0:41:32) industry, you know, in the last six or so weeks, haven't been very kind. It's it's quite incredible actually that that (0:41:38) we've raised approximately 25% of our capital through that particular facility. But we've also done a um a (0:41:46) Bitcoin denominated bond um a small one because what we thought was right for us (0:41:52) is to have equity which includes the ATM um as the primary um capital raising (0:41:59) tool at the moment. Um and then alongside that have a small amount of the Bitcoin denominated bond. And it's a (0:42:05) very similar structure to what you're talking about, but we we we've tried to (0:42:10) do it so that it benefits the investor. So they get the equity upside, but they also get the the performance of Bitcoin, (0:42:19) you know, if it doesn't convert. Um, but then it it works very well for the company because it was effectively a (0:42:25) better share price in terms of a higher share price, i.e. the conversion price (0:42:30) um than we would have got if we did a direct placing at that point in time. Um (0:42:36) so I think that's quite interesting. I think um I think we always need to be careful about you know well in our (0:42:44) opinion getting them to um you know share at an appropriate level the (0:42:51) performance of Bitcoin because in theory over the longer term you know a Bitcoin (0:42:56) treasury company that's properly run um should outperform Bitcoin. Um, so maybe (0:43:03) a bias um towards that product going into the equity side of things, unless (0:43:09) maybe it's just a fixed income thing. Um, because then you're giving them, you know, a guaranteed coupon, um, dividend, (0:43:17) whatever. Depends how you structure it. Um, but then the company's keeping all the upside in the Bitcoin. So, it's like (0:43:24) everything else in life. You you just need to make it fair. fair to the investor, fair to the company um to to (0:43:30) share that you know that future value.

**Sander Andersen:**
Completely agree. Um for me I I think (0:43:35) like equity is a wonderful instrument for some investors but for others like (0:43:40) like a skeptical Bitcoiner. um like how do you design a product that for example (0:43:47) a what like general thought like a bitcoin denominated uh convertible is (0:43:54) fantastic for the company doesn't put any credit risk but in a scenario where (0:44:00) bitcoin goes bananas and your own stock lags you can actually deliver back it's (0:44:08) a wonderful fiat return so if you measure things in fiat it's a wonderful product. If you measure things in (0:44:14) Bitcoin, you have the potential that your stock is actually underperforming the commodity we all believe in. (0:44:21) Short-term, long-term, medium-term, we don't know. Um, so what we have discussed with Bitcoiners is like, okay, (0:44:27) what if you do that convert mechanism depending on the Bitcoin price? So if the company the leverage Bitcoin play (0:44:34) can't overd deliver in terms of Bitcoin return back we won't convert you like (0:44:41) fiat investor doesn't give a [ __ ] about that. Um, so you have like all these opportunities now to design these (0:44:49) instruments that works for you and it's worked wonderful for you and um, so (0:44:54) maybe over to like a question to you Andrew like why are you so successful? (0:44:55) What did Andrew do right? (0:45:00) Like what did you do right?

**Andrew Webley:**
Well, I think we just did what we said we'd do which is you know we've we've got a (0:45:07) strategy. It's quite simple. Um and we've done our best to implement the (0:45:14) strategy. So you know when we started you know the when the advisers and (0:45:20) things were getting getting used to the sort of the world that that that we thought we were entering into they were (0:45:26) they were quite surprised about the speed of capital raises but you know we just sort of kept our foot on the gas um (0:45:33) and um yeah sort of executed the strategy. I think, you know, the thing (0:45:41) that you have to do, you know, is you have to start at the right level. Um, (0:45:48) you know, I I don't know off the top of my head, but I imagine that we did our first raise within a week or so of being (0:45:54) listed, you know, and I think in the first 16 17 weeks, we almost did a raise every single week. (0:46:00) Um, so if you want to get the flywheel turning, I think you need to do that. (0:46:06) The thing that we're very fortunate to have is, you know, a lot of support from people. Um, and that transposes, you (0:46:14) know, into liquidity. Um, which means that, you know, the ATM style facility (0:46:20) can help. So, building out those capital tools. Um, you know, we, um, I believe (0:46:26) we're the first people, maybe even the only people at the moment, um, to do like the Bitcoin denominated bond in the (0:46:32) UK. M um that was heavily inspired albeit a different structure of an (0:46:37) instrument by Alex from Capital B. Um and um so we we did that and I think (0:46:44) I think that's what you've got to do. You've got to you know get the capital strategy and actually implement it. um (0:46:53) you know and then alongside that treat people with respect and communicate and (0:46:58) and um you know you know just do what you said you would do. Um I think one (0:47:05) thing that perhaps we don't get enough credit for is you know my approach to (0:47:11) discounts on capital raises. You know I've often said to people over my dead body (0:47:16) give a discount.

**Tim Kotzman:**
Oh, I've been on the other side of that trade. X didn't like it. (0:47:22) Yeah. But, you know, that's, you know, that comes back to the fact that we've all got similar beliefs and we execute (0:47:28) things sometimes the same, sometimes differently because maybe the markets we're into are are different or maybe (0:47:35) the opportunities that we've got at times are different. Um, and that's not to say that that will always be the (0:47:42) case, you know, like it may be in a year, two years time that it's appropriate to do that for a particular (0:47:48) reason. You know, I hope not. Um, but that's that's that's worked from a (0:47:53) shareholder value point of view. That's worked very very well. But, you know, I think in some ways the market's almost (0:48:01) pricing in that, whereas I've always been very clear that that's not happening. So, do you raise all the capital (0:48:07) yourself?

**Andrew Webley:**
Yeah, we use a mixture of things. So, um, so right at the outset, we involved retail investors from the (0:48:13) start. Um, in the UK, um, it's it's a a hang up from, uh, when we were in the EU (0:48:20) that you can only raise 7 million euros. Um, I think it's seven anyway. Um, (0:48:26) before you have to do a supplementary prospectus. Um, so we couldn't raise money from retail investors once that (0:48:32) was maxed out and it got maxed out very very quickly. Yeah. Um and then in terms of the the (0:48:37) capital away from the MT ATM staff facility, um that's come from a mix, you (0:48:42) know, so that's people from my network and then it's also people from the brokers. Um probably if you look at (0:48:49) every single raise, there's a mixture of the two. Um different amounts at different times. The beauty of when we (0:48:55) raise money ourselves is the commission is either zero or sometimes we pay like (0:49:01) a a settlement charge to the broker um for settling that stock. It depends where it comes from basically. Um you (0:49:08) know whatever is best because you know there's certain rules that you have to comply with you know in terms of AML know your client and things. Um but (0:49:15) yeah, we've we've we've raised um yeah, we've raised quite a lot of it ourselves. Um and moving into the future (0:49:24) um where you know the sums of capital need to be larger um that's why we put (0:49:30) so much effort into the institutional side of things you know and that's a global thing not just a UK thing. M um (0:49:36) you know and some of those institutions will do you know tens of millions some of them might do 5 million you know so (0:49:42) they're different as well you know like the the the shareholders often talk about the institutions but you know an (0:49:49) institution can be you know a pretty wide range of sizes you know um and and (0:49:55) that's something that perhaps not everyone sees all the time

**Sander Andersen:**
yeah I I just want to say like I want (0:50:00) actually to thank you about the how how direct you was on the discount I I think that's your smarter web uh community was (0:50:09) quite vocal about it and and it's actually changed our mind a lot and I'm coming a little bit from the other side. (0:50:15) I'm used to selling investments to investors and it's normally where you do the the deals like you have to have (0:50:22) something to sweeten the pie. Um but in this case uh that made me come to the (0:50:28) conclusion that we are doing things in the in a different order in this industry. we are involving retail from (0:50:34) day one and what I'm I I changed my mind completely about the discounts because (0:50:40) of that because I tell the investors now I can give you a discount but that will (0:50:45) result in a poor share price tomorrow. Mhm. Um, and I think like that you was (0:50:50) so clear about that is is a great thing in Europe because the investor now (0:50:57) understand okay if I [ __ ] with the retail um that will punish my even if I (0:51:04) get a discount of 10% today that might be in red numbers tomorrow because the retail like punish you 15% for doing a (0:51:13) discount for of 10. So yeah I thought it was worth mentioning.

**Jesse Myers:**
You think about it though with the with the business model (0:51:20) of a a company pursuing a Bitcoin treasury strategy. Um if you offer a (0:51:26) discount, you weaken the the incentive (0:51:31) for the regular shareholder to hold that stock. So you encourage them to try and (0:51:37) second guess when you're going to do a raise. And in a lot of cases, those raises are fairly frequent. So you you (0:51:44) actually hurt everyone by doing that because if certain shareholders think, you know, I'm going to sell which would (0:51:49) weaken the price because they'll then, you know, try and offer the company some money, you know, which will come at a (0:51:55) discount. It it it just it just doesn't work if you do it that way in in my opinion. Um so, you know, that's pretty (0:52:03) cool to hear. you know, my my wife um right at the start when when we listed (0:52:09) the business, I was speaking to her about the first raise and and I said, "Well, you know, like everyone's telling (0:52:16) me that, you know, there has to be some sort of a discount." And she said, "No, just stick to stick to your guns and (0:52:21) tell them no." Um and then within like two or three raises, um they didn't even (0:52:26) bother asking me anymore. And and so then what we started doing is we started to explain to, you know, the (0:52:32) institutional investors that no, you're not getting a discount, but you do get a discount on the MNAV once your money (0:52:39) arrives, which is exactly the point that you made before. Um, so yeah, you do get a discount, but it's a discount on the (0:52:46) MNAV after your capital joins in with everyone else's capital.

**Sander Andersen:**
That's actually one of my selling points (0:52:52) these days. Like if you want 1 M now, I can give you one M now. Just give me enough money. (0:52:57) It's cost you like 180 million. Then you have one probably a good deal for everyone.

**Jesse Myers:**
It's really good. It it it has been (0:53:04) interesting how um you know some of these pipe deals have shown you know they they've been structured around you (0:53:10) give a discount and and that's how you attract more capital and and you know get a bigger number. But um it also (0:53:17) creates this we're seeing now this sort of structural headwind of a lot of those investors don't believe in the model. um (0:53:25) they just want to collect that that 10 20%, you know, and that and that means (0:53:32) that they're hedging out their exposure some other way. Um shorting the stock while they're doing the deal. Uh and (0:53:39) then they're getting out and they collect their 10% job's done off to the next one. Um and that screws up uh a (0:53:46) Bitcoin treasure company's flywheel. uh it I think it creates a headwind on day one if you go by that model or it can uh (0:53:55) at least we're seeing a lot of that and so it's it's it's it's interesting it's sort of it's poetic how doing right by (0:54:03) retail and and making sure it's fair for everyone is actually in the best interest of all investors because you're (0:54:09) not creating any headwinds that you know hinder the progress of of the collective (0:54:14) mission of the company to grow Bitcoin per share and I think

**Sander Andersen:**
That's what's changing now with with public companies that you go (0:54:21) so early like public companies isn't exit liquidity anymore. It's actually where you create value and that that's (0:54:28) actually you you change the the model completely.

Really like to to ask you both like what has been like the hardest thing on the (0:56:07) What has been the hardest part of this journey? (0:56:11) journey like what do you mean professionally or personally?

**Sander Andersen:**
I I think body and mind is very well (0:56:17) connected and if you don't like have a good feeling about yourself in general I think that will eventually affect (0:56:24) business. I I I I think personal and business is more of the same.

**Andrew Webley:**
Well, I think the hardest thing for me (0:56:30) then, you know, taking everything into account is, you know, the fact that, you (0:56:35) know, on one hand, I absolutely love what I do and I feel that I'm, you know, one of the luckiest people alive. Um, (0:56:41) but then, you know, I've got a family and, you know, they uh don't see me that much and and that's (0:56:48) that's okay. Um, you know, they're they love seeing me happy. Um, and so they (0:56:54) like that, but you know, I think they miss me a little bit. Uh, and um, yeah, I think that's probably the hardest (0:57:00) thing. What about you?

**Sander Andersen:**
Yeah, I I'm in a little bit um, the same situation. I I got my daughter 6 months (0:57:08) ago. Wow. Um, and it's been quite a rough ride and it's been a I had never had so much fun (0:57:15) in my life. I have to I I love what I do as you do and I'm actually I love (0:57:21) traveling as well. Um, from a professional swimmer, I've always like jumped down to town. It's in my (0:57:26) personality, but like seeing like when you leave your daughter for 2 weeks, it's actually like a at a 6 months old (0:57:34) stage, things are different when you come home. And I have another son at 3-year-old, which I can speak on (0:57:41) FaceTime and stuff, but it's basically like figuring out how to combine the professional life with the family life (0:57:48) you have at home. um when you have two things you love higher than everything. (0:57:54) So you have to like balance it in in the right way. Um I have no nothing to (0:58:00) complain about. But that is like a also something I think a lot about how to do (0:58:06) it in the future because in the Bitcoin treasury space one week is a month or (0:58:14) six months in Treadfi. I I can't take the week off. I canceled my summer vacation this summer because I had to (0:58:20) work.

**Tim Kotzman:**
Yeah. What about you, Jesse?

**Jesse Myers:**
In a similar place, uh toddler and and one on the way and uh and it's hard, you (0:58:27) know, away from the family right now and you know, it's it's it's tough to find that that balance. I I also find uh um (0:58:36) it's it's interesting how in you know it's hard to find the time to create the (0:58:42) all the content or analysis that I want to do you know um sort of the classic (0:58:47) challenge of like high urgency low importance things you know dominate when (0:58:53) you you kind of know there's other things that are higher importance but lower urgency that you'd like to u get (0:58:59) done for for the business for for you know spotlighting um you the value that that we believe (0:59:06) exists in in our company. Um so it's you know it's it's a the classic challenges of finding the right (0:59:14) balance of how you're allocating your time personally and professionally too.

**Tim Kotzman:**
(0:59:19) You know before before this you uh you sort of alluded to the classic uh entrepreneurship uh phrase of like I (0:59:26) think it's like a Peter Teal quote of uh chewing glass and staring into the abyss is entrepreneurship. Yeah. (0:59:32) Um, and it's funny how these are these are public companies. It's totally the classic entrepreneur (0:59:39) experience. How how do you tackle the highs and lows?

**Andrew Webley:**
Well, so I've been an entrepreneur, (0:59:46) small business owner, whatever you want to call it, um, for 15 years. And I think one of the things that you get as (0:59:52) a small business, so this is pre being a public business um is you get resilience (0:59:58) and you know you just keep going you know and you know occasionally you know by the end of the day you're a bit bit (1:00:04) tired maybe a little bit but have you felt this like volatility before like you're a rock star one day (1:00:10) I I I know that what we're doing within the company is getting better and better you (1:00:16) know every day every week. Um and and that's my focus because that's the thing that I can control. Um I (1:00:25) I don't like seeing the share price, you know, sort of, you know, but but you know, I get very very few comments (1:00:32) online of people, you know, being being horrible, you know, and I'm I'm obviously grateful for that. So I (1:00:41) I think so far, you know, it's sort of um not too bad on on that front, but you (1:00:48) know, I all I can do is is do my job and do the strategy that we've been very very clear about. um you know personally (1:00:56) in terms of the volatility you know it doesn't really bother me um you know from my own side of things because you (1:01:02) know I love Bitcoin and I love Bitcoin treasury companies and I I know that over the long term in my opinion they'll (1:01:09) outperform everything else. um you know so it's yeah it's it's obviously much (1:01:17) less enjoyable when you know you're going through a period and the share price is you know coming off like (1:01:24) I I find the MNAV coming down more frustrating than the share price which is obviously linked but a slightly (1:01:31) different thing um but you know you just you just get up and you go again you know and and it's what you've got to do (1:01:38) like um yeah

**Jesse Myers:**
yeah I think uh I think it helps to feel um I guess my my feeling is that (1:01:47) more more of uh annoyance or or frustration at the gap between the (1:01:53) market's pricing uh and the value creation that we have a track record of (1:01:59) delivering, right? Um and so it it to me is like (1:02:04) well this is I guess an opportunity more than anything and it's ridiculous that this is happening but you know knowing (1:02:12) that the numbers are there and having conviction in the model has made it it I (1:02:17) used to run a crypto hedge fund when I first got into this space and in in 2017 (1:02:23) and we were down a lot in 2018 and that was harder because uh it you the there (1:02:30) was less conviction and less clarity about the value of what you know the fund owned then uh and and now it's it's (1:02:39) easier on that front. Um but you know the market is going to do what the market's going to do and and we just (1:02:45) have to keep doing what we're going to do.

**Tim Kotzman:**
How do you how do you find that you know the the last eight weeks have been (1:02:51) tough and Yeah. How do you find it?

**Sander Andersen:**
For me um it's all about focus. I I (1:02:58) basically like track my productivity quite closely and the more I open the stock (1:03:05) app, the less productive I am. I I I think like going back to having like (1:03:11) clear objectives on what to do and why you're doing it and trying to tell it to (1:03:18) yourself and tell it to everyone else in the organization because this at the end of the day we can't affect the stock (1:03:24) price. doesn't help if I do an insider buying or whatever the investor asked me (1:03:29) to do. It's not how the market works. Um, and but it takes some time to (1:03:35) unlearn that because it's quite exciting as well. Like when it goes up, it's exciting. When it goes down, but it's (1:03:42) not so pleasant. But, um, at the end of the day, it's all about like the focus. (1:03:48) Um but more importantly for the like I I think like as an entrepreneur it might (1:03:53) be easier but you have employees that haven't experienced anything like that. (1:03:58) They might coming from highpaying jobs. They have a lot of (1:04:04) things they have done and they have been very successful but they haven't gone through this volatility that you might (1:04:10) be quite resilient um as an entrepreneur.

**Tim Kotzman:**
I thought that was almost going to be a question for you Andrew. uh do the (1:04:16) Discussing volatility with employees (1:04:16) employees ask or or wonder or have anxiety? Um does it does (1:04:23) it come up with the volatility or

**Andrew Webley:**
Yeah. So, you know, we do talk about the share price a bit internally. Um you (1:04:31) know, I like to think that everyone knows, you know, how hard I work. Um you (1:04:38) know, in terms of, you know, not just the effort that I put in, but the hours that I put in as well. Um, and so I (1:04:45) think they all understand the strategy. They understand where it's going. Um, I think they're in a way they're like the (1:04:52) external shareholders where, you know, they love seeing it when it's going up and not so much when it's going down, (1:04:58) but I think it's easier for the employees and it's it's easier for (1:05:04) certainly for me. Um, because, you know, I've got zero doubt in what we're doing. (1:05:09) Um, and obviously with, you know, some of the employees, the ones that are on the permanent insider list, um, you (1:05:15) know, you can have open and honest conversations. They know what meeting I'm going to. They know what we're talking about. You know, they know (1:05:21) literally everything about what we're doing. Um, so, you know, sometimes I (1:05:27) think, you know, what would that feel like if I was just an investor and I (1:05:32) didn't have all that inside information. Um, and you know, being honest with you, I think I would potentially find that (1:05:40) harder. Um, because ultimately what you're asking people to do is you're (1:05:45) asking people to trust you that that you can actually implement a strategy that that they they understand um, properly (1:05:54) um, you know, but you know, I think if you look at our track record, it's been, you know, pretty good. Um, and you know, (1:06:02) we we believe that, you know, we're on the right path for the the next 3 6 9 12 (1:06:08) months and beyond. Um, so yeah, it's just it probably is easier when you're (1:06:15) within the company than when you're outside of the company.

**Jesse Myers:**
Yeah, it ultimately we're sort of asking (1:06:22) investors to trust the the model and trust leadership to execute on the (1:06:28) model. And the experience for investors is is tough because I mean our our (1:06:33) 60-day V annualized is 200% the 200 V (1:06:39) asset is wild. Uh Bitcoin's a 40 V asset. Uh, and that V feels great on the (1:06:47) way up and and it's very testing when you're in a two-month bare market. Uh, (1:06:53) and that's it's a big ask for investors. And I think it speaks to, you know, if (1:07:01) if an investor is willing to hold an asset through that, it means that they have conviction in their own research (1:07:08) and in the model. And uh and that's a testament to to the retail investors that are, you know, make up the majority (1:07:15) of our investor bases is uh they're smart and they've done their homework and they understand Bitcoin and Bitcoin (1:07:22) Vault and they want more of it because Bitcoin's V is good V and Bitcoin (1:07:27) treasury companies amplify that and you know square it for you and uh it it it's (1:07:33) painful but uh it's also great in the long run and hopefully we see more of that in the next 12 months.

**Tim Kotzman:**
(1:07:40) So, we'll obviously tag everyone on social media, but can we just go around and just um let let everyone know kind (1:07:41) Where to find Andrew, Sander, and Jesse online (1:07:47) of where they can find you, the firm, the ticker, whatever you want to cover just real quick in case someone's maybe (1:07:52) listening on audio.

**Sander Andersen:**
Yeah, for me it's on on X is Sandra Anderson. Um and H100 is the ticker (1:08:00) and

**Andrew Webley:**
for us it's ASJ Webbly uh or Smarter Web UK, you know, personal and company (1:08:07) profile. Um, and the ticker in the UK is S SWC. The ticker in the US is TSWCF. (1:08:15) Uh, and in Frankfurt, I believe it's 3 M8.

**Sander Andersen:**
Yep. Yeah, that's right.

**Jesse Myers:**
Uh, and I'm on (1:08:23) Twitter on my old pen name of CISUS_BTC.

**Tim Kotzman:**
Awesome. Sandra Anderson, Andrew (1:08:29) Webbley, Jesse Meyers. Thank you guys for being in the studio. This has been really fun. (1:08:35) Thank you, Tim. Thank you.
