**Austin Alexander (Moderator):**
(0:00:00) Hello, fellow Bitcoin enthusiasts. How's everything going? Yeah. All right. Great stuff. Great stuff, everybody. So much wonderful content. Do you agree, guys? Wow. Great stuff. And so today we're here with these wonderful high IQ individuals who are at the forefront of two of the most successful Bitcoin treasury companies, probably the two most successful Bitcoin treasury companies thus far in Europe, no doubt. Right. So Smarter Web was the biggest IPO in UK history in over 425 years of British capital markets. Correct?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:00:38) That's correct.

**Austin Alexander (Moderator):**
(0:00:41) Oh, wonderful. And Capital B currently has the most Bitcoin of any European listed company. Correct?

**Alexandre Laizet:**
(0:00:47) Correct. And we are the first one.

**Austin Alexander (Moderator):**
(0:00:54) Very nice. So, everybody's super high on their own supply right now and the coin is pumped and we got a lot of coin and it's excellent. But we want to talk about what is the how this all might end up you know at the end of this cycle at the end of next cycle at the end of the next decade and maybe even beyond. So I think the most basic question to start with is what do you see from an investor's perspective as the biggest risk when you're investing in Bitcoin treasury companies? Of course, when you're investing Bitcoin treasury companies, there's a lot of angles, but for the most part, especially people in this audience, they're trying to get, you know, more Bitcoin, right? You can buy Bitcoin and put it in your shoe box or under your mattress or whatever, but you invest in the treasury company so you can have more Bitcoin, right? Because you guys and the Bitcoin treasury companies, they have cheaper cost of capital, they have more access to more financial tools. I mean companies in almost every single regulatory jurisdiction on earth have advantageous positioning to individuals for accessing capital and financial instruments. Correct. So that's why the bull case I suppose of why an investor would want to invest in a Bitcoin treasury company in addition to maybe not in lieu of completely in addition to their personal Bitcoin stash but what should investors be looking for to watch out for as these you know every single day we see what half dozen new announcements new entrance into the market.

**Alexandre Laizet:**
(0:02:38) Hey, look. Yesterday I met an investor and he told me you on panels you always talk about the bullish case for Bitcoin and Bitcoin Treasury companies and he asked me to potentially address some of the concerns of investors and what are the risks. So I would say in terms of what investors are expecting they're investing they are expecting a management of risk as well and the perspective on the long-term perspective of Bitcoin treasury companies and I would like to say first that the riskiest option for investors is to not get enough Bitcoin exposure. The riskiest option and the risk that investors look at is how to get rid of fiat that is getting completely debased and then they look at different options that they have to do so and they have Bitcoin itself for a very specific portion of investors because it's a commodity and 90% of capital in the world is going to be allocated to securities and the goal of a Bitcoin treasury company is to securitize Bitcoin and to provide a form of Bitcoin exposure that is accessible into traditional brokerage accounts and for credit markets and for traditional institutions that are looking for equity.

(0:03:58) And so the risk of Bitcoin Treasury company is to have of course a form of higher volatility than Bitcoin itself. But if you know Bitcoin, you understand that volatility is vitality and volatility is also opportunity. And so if a Bitcoin treasury company is more volatile than Bitcoin but is purely based on Bitcoin and Bitcoin accumulation as in forming a Bitcoin accumulation machine on capital markets then yes there might be more downside risk as an investor but yes there can also be more upside potential if you have a sufficiently long time horizon. And I think that both Smarter Web and Capital B we are providing this type of options to investors with different type of risk appetite and different type of financial instruments that can provide access to Bitcoin in a way that can outperform Bitcoin over time with more volatility in the short term.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:05:11) Yeah, I think the biggest risk for investors is execution. And so, you know, if you're investing in a Bitcoin treasury company, you're typically paying a premium upfront versus the Bitcoin exposure that you're acquiring with that investment. And what you're investing in is the expectation of a continuation of Bitcoin yield into the future, of adding Bitcoin per share going forward into the future. And that's the flywheel. That's the Bitcoin treasury company flywheel that you're hoping is going to continue into the future. And that execution risk is the biggest risk there of perhaps the flywheel never getting started at all. Or perhaps the flywheel losing steam and stopping and you don't return the you know the investment the premium that you've paid up front for that.

(0:06:03) So that's why I think that there's we don't talk enough about how there's now there's 200 Bitcoin treasury companies in the world and a lot of them will never get the flywheel going. A lot of them will struggle to get off the ground and perhaps never really deliver that value back to investors. So I think that it's helpful to think about what's the track record of execution and is this company derisked enough to justify paying a premium upfront because you can have some reasonable expectation of a continuation of the same activities to generate Bitcoin yield into the future.

**Austin Alexander (Moderator):**
(0:07:14) And so in the last well in the ICO wave 2017 there's how many scams infinite scams. So many scams I can't even remember all the scams but thousands. And in the last cycle we had FTX, we had BlockFi and Celsius and Three Arrows and a lot of other scams. What's his name? Terra Luna. A whole bunch of garbage that imploded. And in hindsight you could say, oh, you know, it was we could see it coming because of XYZ or whatever. What are people going to say in hindsight? What is the big scam implosion going to be in this space? And then what are people going to say afterwards to seem smart where they say, "Oh, I saw it all along. I did this and this. I never even invested in that company. They came to me super early. I never invested cuz I knew."

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:08:07) Yeah. Because this is the Bitcoin conference, I will go out on a limb here and say that in hindsight it will be very obvious that treasury companies not built on Bitcoin were a mistake. I think that they will get into trouble just because you're building your foundation on sand on quicksand instead of on the bedrock of Bitcoin and the very real economics there. I think the other thing where people will get into trouble is debt and getting over overleveraged and in any draw down those companies can get into trouble pretty quickly. So people who get out over their skis in terms of how they're raising capital with debt could get into trouble.

(0:09:02) And then there's also other companies whose approach to growing their Bitcoin treasury involves taking shortcuts or you know raising capital at deep discounts to institutional investors and not really treating the flywheel with respect I think and those flywheels may stall out as a result of approaches to raising capital. So, there's a lot of ways where you can do it wrong and I think, you know, we have a lot of respect for Capital B and how they've approached their Bitcoin treasury flywheel. And I think that, you know, investors should take care to pay attention to...

**Austin Alexander (Moderator):**
(0:09:46) And from the investor perspective, what's the for taking care, what's the biggest red flag or what's the warning sign, the number one, two, and three warning signs that retail investors should be looking for?

**Alexandre Laizet:**
(0:09:58) Look, if you want three flags, I would say that you can put three filters to separate the noise from the signal. And the first one, as Jesse mentioned, is is this company focused on Bitcoin? Because Bitcoin is the only asset on earth that has absolute scarcity, that is protected by the most decentralized and secure network in the world, bonded by real world energy, the equivalent of 21 nuclear reactors around the world, protecting the value of your time and work over time in space. That's quite unique and it's the first time in humanity that you have this unique information that this asset is working for you over time and this network is powering you, your family, your corporation, your institution.

(0:10:53) And so if you are focusing on any other asset than Bitcoin for your treasury, then your company is going to zero and it's going to zero against Bitcoin and you are not going to be able to keep up against the other companies that have realized that they need Bitcoin on the balance sheet. It's like having a competition between the dollar and the Zimbabwe dollar. Well, you would want to if you had the option between those two currencies, you would put everything on the dollar. But now you have the option with Bitcoin and Bitcoin has a fixed supply. Why? The dollar has an unlimited supply. So where do you want to store your energy? Where do you want to store the value of your treasury? You want to store it in Bitcoin. So if you have not a focus on Bitcoin as a treasury, you are going to lose and you are going to do a disservice to your shareholder base. So anything other than Bitcoin, any type of diversification is losing value against a Bitcoin treasury company.

(0:11:51) The second filter is the focus on the long-term accumulation of Bitcoin and specifically all in on the long-term accumulation of Bitcoin. Is the company fully committed on a Bitcoin standard to putting all of its long-term capital to Bitcoin on its balance sheet. That's the case for Smarter Web. That's the case for Capital B. That is the playbook of Strategy that has initiated the playbook and MetaPlanet of course and we have continued this with Capital B and Smarter Web and I would say that this is the second principle and it's extremely important because it guides from an ethical perspective what will be the role of the Bitcoin treasury company in capital markets because when you raise capital you need to be a Bitcoin maximalist to negotiate terms with financial institutions that protect your retail investment base and that are extremely accretive over time, not to make a quick buck, not to make a quick pump and dump scheme and then lose the capital over time of your shareholder base. So I think that's an extremely important component.

(0:13:20) And the third filter is whether or not the company is completely committed to have a Bitcoin treasury company strategy like Strategy like MetaPlanet, Capital B, Smarter Web by being completely focused on maximizing the number of Bitcoin per share. And if you own a business and this business is not increasing the number of Bitcoin per share over time, this business is going to zero against the business that is maximizing the number of Bitcoin per share over time. That is my only role in the company. It is to raise capital to maximize the number of Bitcoin per share by accumulating Bitcoin in a consistent manner and to do the capital raise in an accretive way that is at premiums to the Bitcoin we have on the balance sheet to be able to maximize that potential return over time for investors that believe in Bitcoin.

(0:14:22) And if you apply those three filters, you really end up with a handful of companies in the world today. And that provides a lot of clarity and a lot of peace of mind. And at the end of the day, when we talk to major investors, what we are able to do as a completely focused Bitcoin treasury company is to provide peace of mind for investors that know that they have a team that is dedicated to buying more Bitcoin for them over time and that is extremely powerful to take advantage of capital market, the elasticity of capital market to acquire the most inelastic asset on earth which is Bitcoin.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:15:07) Yeah, I would add that on your third point there that there's kind of an obvious thing that we don't talk enough about. There are some companies that are Bitcoin treasury companies focused on Bitcoin yield and then there's other companies who are saying they're Bitcoin treasury companies who are really just adding Bitcoin to their treasury and they're not committing to the Bitcoin yield side of this the shareholder mandate of focusing your time and energy and all your capital on increasing Bitcoin per share. For example, you know, like Tesla has Bitcoin on its balance sheet. That's just part of their Bitcoin treasury strategy in general, but they're not a Bitcoin treasury company. I think the vast majority of corporate adopters will end up being companies that have Bitcoin in their treasury, but they're not focused on increasing Bitcoin per share. So there really is a handful of companies in the world that are Bitcoin treasury companies focused on increasing Bitcoin per share who have a track record of doing that and have generated Bitcoin yield over time and have the infrastructure and you know everything that you'd expect in place to continue that into the future.

**Austin Alexander (Moderator):**
(0:16:18) But that line's like not a solid line and is going to be increasingly more blurry. No, I mean, so like right now we're in this like initial mania phase of like bitcoinizing the capital markets and so we've raised like a lot like my firm personally we've raised a lot of money this year for these plays and thus far right now people almost don't want like actual business. It's like oh even if you have a business that's generating revenue they say I'm not in this to or I mean the mindset is like oh I'm not in this to fund XYZ business I'm not here to fund a printing company or I'm not here to we want to buy Bitcoin and but if Bitcoin is like the money now is going to be the economy is going to be Bitcoinized we're going to hyper Bitcoinize the world or whatever then in due time every company that will survive is going to become a Bitcoin company.

(0:17:22) And that desire to have no business instead of a business, you know, it's like a big business is disadvantaged. You prefer a smaller business if you're going to to like as of the time before today. We'll see what happens in the following months. And no business is even better than a small business. But clearly that cannot be sustainable, right? So how does it come to pass that the entire global economy is bitcoinized and every single company that survives is a bitcoin company by the nature of them having to use bitcoin in their accounting because bitcoin is the money and right now we have this scenario where it's almost like the smaller the better and like you were just mentioning that a bitcoin treasury company is different from a company with a bitcoin treasury but clearly there's going to be some point in the future where having more revenue to acquire more Bitcoin is advantageous to being an empty shell.

(0:18:21) So, especially and everybody here we have a lot of respect for Jesse because he's been one of the first and proper managerial consultant educated class analysts for Bitcoin Treasury companies. So if you haven't seen his analysis, it was very inspirational even to Michael Saylor. They say they say I don't know fully, but people have said that Michael Saylor was heavily influenced by Jesse here. So that's why having you on the stage here is such a pleasure to hear the alpha of where we're going. How do we make how do we make even more Bitcoin, please?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:19:00) Thank you. That's too kind. Too kind. Yeah, I think you're right that ultimately it matters if you're an operating business, but that's at the end of this S-curve of Bitcoin monetizing and becoming the money for the world. And I think we're at the very early stages of that process. And Bitcoin treasury companies right now are the conduits by which we will accelerate the flow of capital from analog store value buckets like equities, fixed income, the money market, even real estate and flow that value into Bitcoin.

(0:19:45) So Bitcoin treasury companies become the piping for hyper-bitcoinization, the plumbing for hyper-bitcoinization. And we've seen that with Strategy. They've created these products to go meet capital where it's at. In the fixed income market, in the equities market, in the money market now with STRK, and they are accelerating the flow of capital from these traditional buckets into Bitcoin. They're pumping capital into Bitcoin. And we're going to see that in every capital market in the world. And that's going to be the story of Bitcoin treasury companies becoming the conduits to help accelerate flow of capital into Bitcoin.

(0:20:20) And we're at the very beginning of that process because in the global asset landscape, Bitcoin is currently 0.2% of global asset value. There's a thousand trillion dollars, a quadrillion dollars of value in the world and Bitcoin is just two trillion of that. And so, you know, Saylor has said that, you know, 20 years from now, Bitcoin will grow from where we're at today to $13 million per coin, and it won't be done then. It'll keep monetizing from there. And, you know, I think that Bitcoin treasury companies will be a big part of that story over the next two decades.

(0:21:03) So, I think the highest and best use of a corporate structure at this point in time is to accumulate Bitcoin in a way that's accretive to shareholders. And eventually, it starts to matter if you're generating profits because we've already fully monetized Bitcoin and there's no longer an opportunity to help capital flow into Bitcoin. But until we reach, you know, the latter half of that S-curve, the most valuable companies in the world and the most undervalued companies in the world right now, in my opinion, are Bitcoin treasury companies because of the opportunity in front of them.

**Austin Alexander (Moderator):**
(0:21:40) And so we had what was it called? Oh yeah, Microsoft. You heard of that one. They had a shareholder vote and it was like 99% voted against even allowing the option of having any Bitcoin on the balance sheet. Correct. So let's say like in the future they vote 99% for it. What does Capital B what is the future for Capital B and Smarter Web and companies like that look like at that point? What is the endgame for them when the or even the midcaps you know even whatever I don't know General Electric or some failing you know legacy business like that finds that they need to adopt this strategy for a chance of survival?

**Alexandre Laizet:**
(0:22:22) You know you asked a question that is a commonly asked question among investors and this question is you have a balance sheet strategy and what will be the next thing and the endgame for a Bitcoin treasury company. What is the P&L? You know, in traditional business, a business is made to make money. What is the best form of money? It's Bitcoin. And what is a Bitcoin treasury company doing is making more Bitcoin. And so the business of a Bitcoin treasury company is the business of making money. And the best way to make money and to make Bitcoin is literally today to acquire Bitcoin through the capital markets.

(0:22:53) And so in some ways during decades the best way to make money was through a P&L and today the balance sheet is the way to make the most money and the balance sheet is in some way becoming a P&L. It's just that when the business makes money and acquires Bitcoin accumulates Bitcoin, it's not fitting that well into the traditional markets and the traditional reporting. But that's why we have new metrics for investors to analyze the way that Bitcoin treasury companies are making more Bitcoin and that is called BTC yield. That is called BTC gain. And BTC gain is just how much Bitcoin have you added to your balance sheet adjusted for dilution. That's literally making money. You are strengthening your balance sheet and that's the endgame for any company.

(0:24:00) So what is the means doesn't matter as much as what is the end and if the end is that you become the company that has the most Bitcoin in your region and you have a dominance on the issuance of securities that allow you to grow your Bitcoin balance sheet better than other companies then that's what you should do as a rational player in the market and look if Microsoft goes in and buys Bitcoin that's good for us because we would have been the first together with Smarter Web and the others to acquire Bitcoin and they would literally increase potentially the Bitcoin price in fiat. So traditional investors would value the companies that are doing it the best because it's not only about the size of the balance sheet. It's about the execution.

(0:24:45) As Jesse mentioned, we are a team of financial engineers in Bitcoin capital markets. We have a shareholder base composed of Adam Back the only person mentioned in the Bitcoin white paper and a major financial engineer as well. We have Full Grow Ventures, UTXO Management, Tobam a major asset manager and our board is composed of like 60 years of capital market experience banking experience Bitcoin experience and in that way you create the best conditions to increase your Bitcoin balance sheet and that's how you make money. That is the business model and that is literally the business model of a central bank is to issue securities and build a major balance sheet and that's what the Bank of France and the Bank of England have done with gold during centuries and that's what we are doing and we are literally the central bank of our own security that we have the monopoly to issue on our own capital markets.

(0:25:48) And we have the capacity with Smarter Web to accrue billions and billions millions of dollars of value of Bitcoin and at some point the value of dollars will not matter anymore and what will matter is the number of Bitcoin under balance sheet for us it's already the case but there are hundreds of trillions of units of capitals in the world and those are going to be transferred to Bitcoin and the Bitcoin treasury companies will be the ones that will then partner with P&L BTC generating companies that will want to have access to the securities of the Bitcoin treasury companies to get an outsized performance for their own P&L. And so the balance sheet is the P&L actually for a Bitcoin treasury company.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:26:35) Yeah. I think this comes back to like what is the identity of a Bitcoin treasury company? And you know what does Bitcoin not do for you? It doesn't generate yield, right? Like there's no way to make more Bitcoin by holding Bitcoin. And so the identity of a Bitcoin treasury company is finding ways to generate Bitcoin yield. And right now and for the next two to four decades, that's going to be using capital market tools to help facilitate the flow of trad capital and trapped pools of capital into Bitcoin and add Bitcoin per share in a very rapid pace that way.

(0:27:14) And in the process, these businesses are going to become the best capitalized businesses in the world. And you know, we're already seeing that with Strategy. And as Bitcoin continues to grow in value, these are going to become the pristine balance sheets of people's dreams. And they will become the you know the Bitcoin banks of the future I think in the sense that they will eventually shift from generating yield by arbitraging trad capital into Bitcoin. And you know when we reach that future state of there's no more capital left to flow into Bitcoin because we've saturated all store of value in the world.

(0:27:56) At that point in time, then it shifts to operating businesses and finding Bitcoin yield by generating profits by becoming the financial institutions, the lenders of the future in you know decades from now.

**Austin Alexander (Moderator):**
(0:28:14) Two to four decades?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:28:20) Yeah. Two to four decades I'd say.

**Austin Alexander (Moderator):**
(0:28:25) Wow. And so you know that's the identity of what these Bitcoin treasury companies are. They are in the business of generating Bitcoin yield, growing your Bitcoin ownership over time. That means taking risk. And in the near term, the tremendous opportunity in front of this nascent industry is to help flow capital from the TradFi world into Bitcoin and grow Bitcoin per share.

(0:28:52) All right, there it is, guys. The alpha is definitely worth the price of admission, was it not? We hear that we're in the beginning of a four decade long bull market in Bitcoin treasury companies. And so I don't know about you, but me, I'm max bid. I'm ready to go. I'm a buyer. Some high IQ stuff here. All right, we're gone. Thank you very much. You're doing great. Thank you.
