**James:**
(0:00:02) Jesse, welcome back. Thanks for coming on. Um, appreciate you're very busy. Um, (0:00:09) but I think uh this time we're we're going to dive straight into the questions. Um, first of all, so sorry, some of (0:00:17) these are a mix of uh X, Discord, Telegram. Just putting that out there to (0:00:22) people that all those platforms exist uh for joining the community. Um, (0:00:29) and some of them are my own questions. Um, okay, let's go. So, Smarter Convert, (0:00:34) could this be sold with a higher premium? Um, there's a few out there, particularly the person who asked this (0:00:40) question to be asked today, um, that feel like it's too good a deal for the (0:00:45) buyer.

**Jesse Myers:**
Yes. Um, can and will be uh is sort of (0:00:51) our current thinking. We'll uh we'll we'll see how it evolves. But I (0:00:58) agree. I think it's a it's an incredible product, an incredible offer for um the (0:01:04) investor in particular and the company um should be able to get a little bit (0:01:11) more of a conversion premium. Um, I guess sort of recap for people, um, my (0:01:17) math on it, this is dated as of a week or two ago. Um, is that, you know, the (0:01:24) the Smarter Web stock 60-day V annualized is 220%. (0:01:32) Um, which creates a ton of option value. It's just sort of black shores option (0:01:37) pricing. Um it it it it amounts to like 70% of the share price. Uh the you know (0:01:47) option value is equal to 70% of of share price which in theory and and in (0:01:52) practice you're not going to get that because nobody nobody believes that (0:01:59) 220 V is real. Um you know for understandable reasons too. (0:02:05) Um anyway, so in theory, you get 70% of the share price uh in option value to (0:02:14) split between the company and investors. In practice, it's probably a lot lower (0:02:19) than that, maybe something like 50%. Um but the the first trunch we did with (0:02:26) Tobam uh we took 5% of that uh as as our (0:02:32) conversion premium for them. Um and of course we we did that at a at a time (0:02:38) when the price was a fair bit higher. So uh you know that that has so far been (0:02:44) good for us I guess. Um, I think going forward, you know, we we'll probably try (0:02:50) like 10% conversion premium on the next one. I think there's there's room to increase it beyond that, but frankly, (0:02:57) it's uh I think it's sort of hard to get investors uh you know, you got to build awareness (0:03:04) of this product. Um, I think people are so accustomed, Bitcoin holders are so (0:03:09) accustomed to being inundated with like, oh, like just give us your Bitcoin and we'll outperform Bitcoin by taking all

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:03:15) sorts of hedge fund risk that we won't tell you about. And like that's like the thing that people are trained to to be (0:03:23) wary of and to avoid, especially after like three arrows capital, um, which was doing that and then (0:03:30) imploded. So, you know, this product offers a way (0:03:36) to outperform Bitcoin really with like no risk because it's it's an option. You you know, this the (0:03:43) stock either outperforms Bitcoin or it doesn't. And if it doesn't, then you get 98% of your Bitcoin back. So, you know, (0:03:49) that's your downside there. Um and it's ringing fenced in a way where you know (0:03:54) investors know that you know they have a legal claim on the the Bitcoin sitting in this ring fenced entity and it's and (0:04:01) it's bankruptcy remote. Um, so anyway, we it's I think a process of having to (0:04:08) raise awareness to large Bitcoin holders that like look, if you want to outperform Bitcoin, uh, you can take a (0:04:17) bunch of risk or you can participate in this option, you know, this option value (0:04:23) where we owe you your Bitcoin. If if in the event where uh the stock doesn't outperform, you'll get your Bitcoin (0:04:30) back. um and and that's the extent of the risk you're taking. So basically basically there's a lot of option value (0:04:35) in our volatile stock and this is a product to productize that V into (0:04:41) something that's mutually beneficial for the company and for share for investors um and you know I think over time we (0:04:49) will be able to raise more awareness around that um and and continue to raise that conversion premium so that the

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:04:56) company is taking a greater share of that option value. Um, but you know, (0:05:01) anything over zero conversion premium is better than straight equity issuance. (0:05:07) And I think that's the important thing to to remember. Like, yes, we're giving the investor a lot of value, but it's in (0:05:15) any case better than than straight equity issuance on that day. Um, and and (0:05:21) that's this that's because we're productizing our ball and and there's a lot of value there and we're going to (0:05:28) figure out how to capture more of that as the company, but first we have to raise awareness that like here's a way (0:05:33) to outperform Bitcoin that's not like hedge fund risk.

**James:**
(0:05:38) Cool. So, um there's a couple of things out of that. Uh one is um (0:05:46) the uh you say about options. Um (0:05:52) is that something you guys organize? Is that something brokers organize if if you went if if if options were offered (0:05:58) on SWC in the future?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:06:03) Yeah, that's a good question. Um I'm less familiar with with how other (0:06:08) companies do this. I know that, you know, as as the company, you can you can (0:06:14) offer it directly. Um, but that is, you know, uh, oneoffs and kind of lumpy and (0:06:20) you would need it to be like of of great size for it to be worth doing. Obviously, then there's like market

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:06:25) makers who are happy to to, you know, create that market um, you know, on stocks where there's demand for that. uh (0:06:33) and and I don't really know how um Bitcoin treasury companies currently (0:06:38) are are approaching that but but yeah there there's you know there's so (0:06:44) obviously with with Smarter Convert there's an option built in. Um if we were to do like a standalone options (0:06:50) product we would we would only do that if there was signific significant demand (0:06:55) from large investors. Um

**James:**
(0:07:02) I I think we would be excited about um market makers wanting to create uh (0:07:09) options products. Um and hopefully I I guess that's just part of you know the (0:07:15) next stage of growth for us and and maturing as an asset in the financial landscape. Um so yeah, we'll see what (0:07:23) how that plays out.

**James:**
Okay, cool. And and and just back to the smarter convert for a second. Um (0:07:30) the I is there a way for retail to get involved in it? Is there like a minimum (0:07:36) size? Uh could it be a group of retail investors? You know, a bit like a a book (0:07:44) build as a group of institutions.

**Jesse Myers:**
Yeah. Um good question. I I always (0:07:50) forget to mention this part. Um it it's because of the nature of it, it has to (0:07:56) be a pretty significant size for it to make sense. Um so the sort of you know (0:08:03) finger in the air number we have is is is 10 bitcoin uh is minimum size and even in the 10 bitcoin scenario we would (0:08:10) need to bundle several investors like that together uh into a tunch to make it (0:08:15) make sense. Um, but yeah, so you know, if there are people out there, (0:08:20) basically, if there are people out there with over 100 Bitcoin, I think this is a fantastic product if you're looking to (0:08:27) outperform Bitcoin and please reach out to us if that's of interest to you and we would love to bundle you up with a (0:08:33) few other people like that. Um, and and turn that into a trunch. Um, so you

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:08:40) know, and really I think most likely the next trunch will probably be some family (0:08:46) office or something like that that's sitting on a,000 Bitcoin and they think, oh, this would be a great thing to do (0:08:52) with 100 Bitcoin, you know. Um, so we'll see how that plays out. But um I I think (0:09:00) I think it's hard it's it's hard to raise awareness about this product because (0:09:07) um people are so accustomed to just riding off any any u value proposition (0:09:12) that sounds like this. Um but but I think the but the fundamentals are there and so we will eventually you know catch (0:09:19) the interest of more and more people and and I think I saw that in Hong Kong where you know on the surface people are (0:09:25) like what why why would we ever do that but then uh you know any longer (0:09:32) conversations I had people are like wait a second that sounds like a win-win and it and it really is. Um, anyways, yeah, (0:09:38) so kind of 10 bitcoin minimum and we would need to bundle it up with a few other people, but but yeah, reach out to us if that if either of those cases fits (0:09:46) or if you know anybody who's who's sitting on thousands of Bitcoin and trying to outperform Bitcoin. Um, (0:09:52) because there are those whales out there who who uh are in that position (0:09:58) and there's room in any portfolio for risk, right? Right. Right.

**James:**
(0:10:03) Um, so kind of a segue into uh another thing. Um, there's been a lot of chatter (0:10:10) in the SBC community uh and and a few others around defending MNAV.

**James:**
(0:10:16) Um, we'll get on to the grain assault thing. I don't know if you had a chance to read it, but we'll get on to that later. Um, (0:10:23) in this

**James:**
Okay, cool. Um the the thing I'm thinking is a com a (0:10:32) Bitcoin backed convertible is that one of those tools that can be used when (0:10:39) you're at a low MAB as long as the premium is enough? Yes. To to kind of hopefully leverage your (0:10:46) way out of I don't know sub one MNAB or or at least just keep keep stacking.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:10:52) Exactly. um you know when the MNAV and again I (0:10:58) haven't I haven't studied this that much. I know that there are options and I know that, you know, we would be able to to get sharp on them and and (0:11:04) implement various tools in the 1xmnav scenario and in the sub 1xmnav scenario (0:11:11) um slightly different tools. Um, you know, as you get closer to one, uh, (0:11:20) in my mind, um, longdated debt becomes more appealing. And obviously, we kind (0:11:26) of have the philosophical stance that that Bitcoin denominated debt is better, even though you you miss out on the (0:11:33) obvious divergence in purchasing power of the the fiat that you owe in an (0:11:38) ordinary debt um, structure. um versus the Bitcoin that grows in (0:11:44) purchasing power and so it becomes easier to settle the debt further down the road. But in the bit in the bare (0:11:50) market scenario, there's problems, right? And so we prefer Bitcoin denominated debt because it gets rid of

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:11:57) all those problems. Um uh but yeah, it longdated (0:12:03) Bitcoin denominated debt uh as like like smarter convert but with (0:12:09) longer duration creates a lot of um creates a lot of option value if you're (0:12:14) if you're doing a convert like that. Um and then that option value, you know, (0:12:20) the longer it is, the more option value there is. Uh and you can split that between the company and the investor. (0:12:26) So, you know, we could be we could be in a scenario where, you know, we're at 1xm nav. I don't think I frankly I don't (0:12:34) really think that's what's happening here. But if we are in the scenario where we are in 1xm nav, and that'll (0:12:41) probably happen at some point, as Andrew pointed out yesterday, like maybe a couple years from now, we're in that situation. So, you know, we need to um (0:12:49) know that we have tools and and I think we do. in that in that 1x situation (0:12:55) if you did a smarter convert where there's a you know 25% conversion premium because it's a really longdated (0:13:03) um um option um longdated note and uh (0:13:09) there's a lot of option value there so you can you know the company can get 25% of that um then you're effectively at a (0:13:15) 1.25 25 mnav for that transaction. Uh and and that's how you can, you know, be (0:13:21) accreative in that scenario and and get that flywheel going. Um and you know, the more of those you do, the the more (0:13:28) Bitcoin yield you're generating and and you can uh help accelerate that flywheel, get to a more positive MNAV

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:13:34) and start running the other tools that that you know we know in the in the toolkit are very helpful. Um, so yeah, (0:13:44) that so that's a, you know, in that 1x MNAV scenario, that would be an approach (0:13:50) we would I I would be more interested in in leaning into. Um, we talked a little (0:13:56) bit yesterday about, you know, we're aware of of how Metaplan approaches cash cash secured puts. Um, and there's also (0:14:04) covered calls to put some of your of your NAV to work in a way that generates (0:14:13) income that can be used to buy Bitcoin. Um, and (0:14:19) that keeps the flywheel turning. Um, so, you know, those are those are two options and there are certainly others. (0:14:26) And of course in the sub at 1xm nav scenario there's there's other options (0:14:31) some of which grain of salt articulated the other day. Um (0:14:37) yeah so you know we're there's a whole toolkit that that differs based on the circumstances of of MNAV. Um and we (0:14:44) would explore whatever whatever makes sense in the circumstances of the moment (0:14:50) for the interests of shareholders.

**James:**
Okay. Yeah. Let's move on to grain of (0:14:56) salts uh open letter. Um I'm probably oversimplifying it massively, but the (0:15:03) way I read it was in a situation where you have a sub one MNAV, you offer up (0:15:09) Bitcoin in kind uh dividends uh to encourage people to buy it, which

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:15:15) hopefully pushes the MNAV back to to one. um and he quoted Grayscale BTC as a (0:15:23) sort of case study of this. What are your thoughts on that?

**Jesse Myers:**
Yeah, I think I think I think he's right (0:15:29) that the mechanics are there. Um, basically what he's saying is like if (0:15:35) you threaten to, you know, return Bitcoin, um, then the market is forced to value (0:15:42) it not as like a close-ended vehicle, but as an open-ended vehicle (0:15:47) where, you know, the Bitcoin nav is should be priced accordingly. Um, (0:15:55) of course, the problem with that is that you're sort of giving up you're you're literally shrinking the company, (0:16:00) shrinking the the the scale of the Bitcoin treasury um by distributing it. (0:16:07) You know, I guess the the ideal scenario is that you threaten to do that um and don't actually distribute it. Um, but if (0:16:15) you do distribute it, then you're giving up some of the scale uh and and the economies of scale of your company and (0:16:22) the leadership position that that um commands uh you're you're literally (0:16:28) giving up uh little by little there. So, I think that I think that there are (0:16:34) downsides to that that um that that that grain wasn't, (0:16:42) you know, fully uh articulating or or um (0:16:47) was just sort of focusing on the the front end of that which is real. I think that you know you you by having that

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:16:54) threat uh that will distribute dividends in Bitcoin um it that would create sort (0:17:00) of upward pressure if you're under 1xmnav but yeah but there would be costs I (0:17:05) think to the to the success of the company after that. Um but you know I (0:17:12) think the counterargument would be well if you're under 1xm nav like you have to do something. Um so I understand that (0:17:18) and and I think it was very uh interesting thoughtprovoking you know I saved it. So (0:17:25) you know I would refer back to it in the future to get sharp on strategies uh if (0:17:30) we end up in that scenario. But but again, I think that as I mentioned yesterday, I think that the best thing (0:17:36) that a Bitcoin treasury company can do is everything that it can to not end up in a 1x sub 1x mnav scenario. And the (0:17:44) most important thing is is a track record of execution of adding Bitcoin yield. And that's why um we've been very (0:17:52) focused and and very proud to achieve Bitcoin yield even during this downtrend. Um, you know, the last two (0:17:59) months have been quite sharp um, contraction in MNAVs. Uh, and yet over (0:18:06) the last five weeks, we added plus 28% Bitcoin per share. Um, it it might (0:18:11) actually be a few percent higher than that, but that's the number that I have stuck in my head. Um, so, you know, (0:18:18) that's great, especially considering that our that our um, as of yesterday, (0:18:24) our MNAV was 1.66. Uh, and so, you know, it only takes a

**James:**
(0:18:29) couple months of plus 28% um to to make that mnav back and then (0:18:37) anything beyond that is is Bitcoin gained. And that's the whole point of a Bitcoin treasury company. So, you know, (0:18:44) I I think the best defense against a 1xm nav or sub 1xm nav is running a really (0:18:50) clean balance sheet. um and and we'll talk more about that, but running a clean balance sheet and then having a (0:18:57) track record of delivering Bitcoin yield through good times and bad so so that (0:19:02) investors can have a degree of confidence that that that the company (0:19:07) will continue to add Bitcoin yield and then investors collectively can price that in in terms of their expectations (0:19:15) of what's the value of this company in Bitcoin terms. Um and and that's how you (0:19:20) stay above a 1x mnave. Um of course it's always possible you have a short-term (0:19:25) capitulation spike under 1x or something like that. But you know I I think the best way to keep above you know on a on (0:19:34) a your keep your twoe average above 1xm nav is having a track track record of of (0:19:41) uh delivering. Um yeah. Okay cool. Um (0:19:50) whilst we all know there's no formal end of year target and the next milestone is 4,200 (0:19:56) Bitcoin. Um Andrew did drop out in the Tim Cutsman uh in one of his marathons. (0:20:04) Um 6 to 8,000 would seem like a a sort of ballpark

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:20:09) area. Is that still uh an area the team are looking at and does it feel re (0:20:16) realistic given current market conditions etc. Yeah. Um (0:20:23) I I sort of I suppose it's it's dependent on what the market gives us for the rest of the year. Um but you (0:20:31) know our internal math um sure looks like it's going to be possible to add a (0:20:36) lot of Bitcoin through the end of the year assuming any amount of you know um turnaround in in (0:20:45) current trajectory of MNAVs um you know or even if it just stays around here uh (0:20:51) there's a lot that we can do and there's a lot of traction we're getting um you (0:20:56) know obviously we've seen that with retail investors and and now we're starting to see that with institutional conversations. Um so, you know, I I (0:21:05) don't know where we end up at the end of the year in terms of Bitcoin stack. Um (0:21:10) but I think it'll be quite a bit higher than it is right now. And um and yeah, I (0:21:16) mean it sort of depends on how Bitcoin does the rest of the year and then how (0:21:22) you know quickly enthusiasm returns to Bitcoin treasury company sector. Um I (0:21:29) think you know my personal perspective is that these equities continue to be (0:21:34) the most undervalued in the world. um you know because that was the whole point of the the PBID report we put out (0:21:42) where if you look at you know how quickly a well-run Bitcoin treasury company delivers value to shareholders

**James:**
(0:21:49) um as compared to a a traditional equity that's generating income year-over-year (0:21:55) and and that turns into PE ratio of 20 30 40 versus a a P bid ratio for (0:22:02) strategy of something right now it's something like two um And for us at the (0:22:07) moment, it's something like a quarter of a year. So like 0.25. Um it's pretty incredible how rapidly (0:22:16) uh a well-run Bitcoin treasury company delivers value. And and I think that the (0:22:21) market still isn't appreciating um that and and is basically sleeping on the (0:22:28) business model of a of a well-run Bitcoin treasury company. And of course, I keep saying well-run because there's a (0:22:33) lot of Bitcoin treasury companies that won't get off the ground in terms of getting their flywheel moving. And (0:22:40) there's a lot of Bitcoin treasury companies that uh looked like they might have their flywheel moving and and this (0:22:48) recent bare market for for treasury companies has stopped that flywheel for (0:22:53) a number of those companies globally. Um, and obviously, you know, the (0:22:59) lifeblood of a Bitcoin treasure company is having that flywheel turning, keeping that Bitcoin yield flowing. Uh, and uh, (0:23:07) and and that's what it takes in order to continue delivering Bitcoin yield and have that sort of expectation into the (0:23:13) future of Bitcoin yield that makes them undervalued. Um because you know so long (0:23:19) as you're delivering some amount of Bitcoin yield it's it pretty quickly compounds into uh you know value

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:23:26) delivered to shareholders. Uh and yeah so I think that we're I think we're (0:23:32) going to see coming out of this you know sharp contraction in global enthusiasm (0:23:38) for Bitcoin treasury companies. um exactly what has happened to MetaPlanet already like four times which is a (0:23:46) basically a full sentiment cycle. Um and you know we're accustomed to that in Bitcoin being four years long. And when (0:23:53) you go back and you and you walk through the the MetPanet price chart and line (0:23:59) that up with their MNAV over time which they've you know they've published on their website and in their decks. Um you (0:24:06) can see how sentiment was high here, price crashed, MNAV compressed (0:24:13) uh and then a few months late, you know, consolidation occurs and then a few months later the next cycle um the next (0:24:19) sentiment cycle and and I think that's probably what what's going to happen with you know (0:24:25) what's going to happen here um for for well-run Bitcoin treasury companies globally and that includes smarter web. (0:24:35) Yeah. Yeah, and I think on that last point, um, if anyone's interested in market cycles but doesn't know much about them, there's a great book called (0:24:41) Mastering Market Cycles by Howard Marx, uh, that could really help people kind (0:24:48) of understand the whole euphoria at the top and the uh, depression or whatever (0:24:54) at the bottom and then and then how it returns and that's the market cycle. It's like a pendulum that swings. (0:25:00) Yeah. Just right. Exactly. If you think about a pendulum, you know, it it moves very quickly from one side to the other, but

**James:**
(0:25:07) then it kind of, you know, the the change in momentum is a full sine wave, right? Like it's a classic sine wave and (0:25:14) it takes some time for that momentum to change and then it happens really quickly, right? You move, you shift back (0:25:19) to the positive side of things very quickly. I think that's how sentiment works in markets. And and frankly, I (0:25:27) think that we're kind of here right now, right? and and there's a a process of sentiment shifting. (0:25:34) Cool. Um, quick one for you. Is the company using operating profits to buy a BTC? (0:25:41) I saw that in in one of the one of the questions and I didn't answer it so that we could talk about it here. (0:25:48) Yeah. In fact, uh, yes, which is a little known fact. I don't know if Andrew's even mentioned it, but but a (0:25:55) very tiny amount of operating profits has now been used to buy Bitcoin. Tiny (0:26:01) tiny amount. But yes, so that's that's not something that most Bitcoin treasury (0:26:07) companies can say, especially in the sort of pipe era that we've been in with how these companies have been uh these (0:26:14) have have have how these Bitcoin treasury companies have been approached. Um but yeah, we now have Bitcoin (0:26:22) purchases from operating profits. A tiny amount, but it's there. (0:26:28) Okay. And is there (0:26:33) uh is there government risk around shutting down SWC, taxing their BTC, um (0:26:39) or even confiscating it? And I laugh because at first read the taxing their BCC kind of sounds ridiculous, but um

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:26:48) with our current government uh thinking about introducing a wealth tax on (0:26:53) unrealized gains um you know what are your thoughts? (0:26:59) The Yeah, the uh it's wild. It's wild to to watch the the current political (0:27:06) climate in the UK uh from afar. Um, wow. (0:27:11) But, uh, when it comes to Bitcoin, I think that the most helpful sort of lens is to look (0:27:20) at how have things been tracking recently, like what what (0:27:26) direction has regulatory stance been moving in, you know, over the last year? (0:27:33) Um and I I think the reality of what's been going on in you know all G7 countries really is (0:27:41) the US came out and said okay Bitcoin ETFs are all right 18 months ago right (0:27:47) they launched uh and that's been a a boon to you know the the US financial (0:27:54) sector and and Wall Street uh and and then Micro Strategy has been the biggest (0:28:00) beneficiary of that increased regulatory clarity in the US more so than the ETFs (0:28:07) like the ETFs have ingested capital but um Micro Strategy has ingested way more (0:28:12) capital than than I think anybody expected over this the 18 months where there's been increased regulatory (0:28:19) clarity. So now in the UK and and I think in every G7 country uh there's

**James:**
(0:28:25) been a reaction of like well we can't we can't just you know let that (0:28:30) happen without us. Uh all right maybe we need to at least follow suit in some or get (0:28:38) sharp at least on on Bitcoin. And now we're seeing in the UK they've green lit (0:28:43) Bitcoin ETNs which are not quite ETFs but same idea. Um, and and I and we're (0:28:51) excited about that because first of all, UK investors should have access to a to (0:28:57) vehicles that track Bitcoin exposure through their, you know, stock portfolios. (0:29:03) Um, that's good for UK investors, but it's also good for Smarter Web, we think, because the biggest beneficiary (0:29:09) in the US was Micro Strategy as the, you know, blue chip Bitcoin treasury (0:29:15) company, the preferred vehicle for increasing your Bitcoin (0:29:20) ownership through a publicly traded entity, right? And Smarter Web is that (0:29:27) in the UK. Um and and so I think that's going to be a big tailwind for the (0:29:33) company um and and will help grow our investor base um as this increased (0:29:40) recent increased regulatory clarity in the UK manifests into you know a (0:29:45) cultural shift of maybe you should have some Bitcoin exposure in your stock portfolio. Maybe institutional investors (0:29:52) should you know allocate a little bit to Bitcoin treasury companies. Uh and and I think

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:29:58) that era is like starting kind of now, right? Like people people are back from the beach. This regulatory clarity is (0:30:06) now out there. Bitcoin ETNs are coming. And so I think this fall we're going to (0:30:11) see a bit, you know, more of that in in conversations that we're having. (0:30:18) Um Okay. And are there any plans and I know you spoke a bit about this last (0:30:24) night uh to update the ATM and yeah the answer last night for everyone who (0:30:30) hasn't listened to it was no not currently looking at it reassessing etc. (0:30:35) Um but the other part to this question that I thought was maybe quite useful to (0:30:40) discuss was um you know if it was updated um is there the possibility of (0:30:47) uh making the rules opaque or obfiscated um (0:30:53) to avoid playing games with it etc. Yeah I I see what you mean. Um it's (0:31:00) always possible. Um, you know, we're we're like I think about this quite a bit and (0:31:07) um and I'm, you know, every every week or so I have some some new idea that I (0:31:12) run by Andrew of like like would this make it harder to game, you know, or or (0:31:18) are we being gamed? Um, so it's on my mind, it's on Andrew's mind, it's on our broker's mind. Uh, and we're kind of we (0:31:26) run a fair bit of like spot tests to to see, you know, how are things working

**James:**
(0:31:32) and uh little tests here and there to see the impact of things. Um, and we (0:31:39) haven't seen any sort of evidence of this being gamed at all. Um, (0:31:46) so that's good. Uh we could always, you know, if if we believe that we are that (0:31:51) it is being gamed in some way, we could make it more opaque how we're doing it. (0:31:56) Um I think more likely we would add some sort of (0:32:02) criteria that would be publicly known that would make it harder to game. Um (0:32:07) but but again at the moment we don't think it's being gamed. Um we we basically we think that the global (0:32:14) contraction for Bitcoin treasury companies has been driving all of it. (0:32:19) Um, and you know that has been painful for Smarter Web because there's a lot of (0:32:24) people from who were in heavy profits and uh and and then some people who (0:32:31) bought the top and are, you know, probably didn't really know what they were holding and have have been panic selling and and unfortunately that's (0:32:38) kind of what happens with a with an asset that's monetizing, you know, from nothing. like the the correlations to (0:32:45) Bitcoin are, you know, resounding in my mind of, you know, when an asset (0:32:50) monetizes from nothing, there's a lot of profit taking, a lot of volatility that happens along the way and it manifests (0:32:57) in Bitcoin's case and now in Smart Web's case as these little mini cycles. Um,

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:33:02) but you know, think of you if you zoom out a little bit of where does that kind of put us now? Well, there's been fear (0:33:09) and there's been, you know, gloom, pessimism, um, and capitulation. I (0:33:16) think, I hope, uh, we'll see. But what that amounts to is, you know, in (0:33:22) Bitcoin, it's coins changing hands to new holders. Here, it's shares changing hands to new holders who are starting (0:33:29) their journey, right? like people who are entering now are saying I think this is a great entry point and I'm not and (0:33:36) I'm not worried about you know the price going down further and and me not having (0:33:42) taken profit from IPO right the the people who are entering now are like this is a great deal and I'm going to (0:33:48) hold it for years um and and that eventually that eventually amounts to (0:33:55) enough shares changing hands to people like that that you set that floor All right. And (0:34:02) that's kind of that's my mental model of how how it has worked with Bitcoin over, you know, the 16 years and four four (0:34:09) year cycles. Um and and that's I think what we're seeing here too, as we've s (0:34:15) seen with MetaPlanet over the last 16 months. So, so yeah, that's that's my mental (0:34:22) model of what's going on. Um, and in terms of the ATM, like you know, we we (0:34:29) feel that it's been working. Um, it's just unfortunately been in this climate of, you know, the MetPanet being (0:34:38) having a sharp draw down and that's kind of sucked the air out of the room for for all small pure play Bitcoin treasury

**James:**
(0:34:46) companies, right? and and then these pipe deals have exacerbated that as (0:34:52) institutional investors have been selling off those. Um, so it has amounted to just a sectorwide bare (0:34:58) market, but you know, we've still had some green days during that like the you (0:35:04) know, in the last few days it's been it's been green um and pretty sharply green and uh and the ATM has been (0:35:11) running and um and that's been I think you know it it it's essential for (0:35:18) keeping the flywheel going um because the capital that we've uh ingested (0:35:24) through the ATM running on on the days when it's up enables us to, you know, (0:35:30) make Bitcoin buys and add Bitcoin yield um and keep that flywheel turning. So, (0:35:37) you know, even though the flywheel has slowed down during this period, to me, I (0:35:43) think it's um I think the essential thing is the flywheel continues to move. (0:35:48) Meanwhile, a lot of other upandcoming Bitcoin treasury companies have seen their flywheel grind to a halt. And once (0:35:57) that happens, you run a real risk of it never restarting because you lose (0:36:03) investor confidence. So, you know, we're as painful as it is, we're probably in a (0:36:09) in a relative position of greater strength now relative to the, you know, (0:36:14) the other certainly in the UK and and also globally other Bitcoin treasury companies. Um, I think we are stronger

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:36:22) relative to the to to our peers than we were two months ago. Um, and that's been (0:36:29) in large part due to the ATM running. Yeah, just a some thoughts. I don't know (0:36:36) if you saw any of my replies on the ATM in the group, but um and it's kind of a (0:36:42) part of the obfuscation package. Um is is it being more dynamic uh you know, (0:36:49) you don't have to publicize the rules about it. um just that you'll take into (0:36:55) account different variables on the day um and run it at an appropriate level in (0:37:02) that time frame kind of thing. Um and that's kind of where my head was at and then it's just (0:37:08) maybe you still got the 20% rule as as the cat but then all of that room to (0:37:14) maneuver within it. Yeah, it's a good point. Um and it's possible we we experiment with something (0:37:21) like that. I I do want everyone to be aware like we will continue to change things with with the ATM and um and when (0:37:28) that happens, you know, know that it's us tinkering with what's the best way to do it rather than, you know, anything (0:37:35) sort of reactive like we have a mindset of like we can we can and should (0:37:40) experiment to make things better. Um and and maybe that's one of the things we we (0:37:46) try out. you know, obviously Andrew feels very passionately about um (0:37:51) transparency and and I think that, you know, with our ATM instrument, the

**James:**
(0:37:57) transparency of how and when we're selling shares into the market um is, I (0:38:02) think, very valuable overall to the investor community to know that like we're not selling on the on these (0:38:09) painful down days. So, you know, if you remove that clarity, (0:38:14) that, you know, might cause some second order effects of like people feeling like we are doing that when when we're (0:38:21) not, but we wouldn't be able to prove it. Um, so you know, I think there's there's lots of second order effects and (0:38:28) that's where having really simple rules helps make it not only easier to explain (0:38:34) to people, but um, you know, just just clearer and and less cause for um people (0:38:42) to spiral in terms of FUD uh about what's going on, you know. (0:38:48) Sure. Uh, okay. Let's move on from the ATM. Um, (0:38:54) how was Hong Kong? Um, was it, you know, tell us a bit about the Hong Kong trip, but also was it a productive trip with (0:39:01) regards connections and, you know, meetings, etc.? Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Um, you know, (0:39:07) it's funny with with Bitcoin conference. I guess I've done quite a few things like this at this point. Um, (0:39:14) and and it's it's always a whirlwind. Uh, and you you talked to a bunch of (0:39:19) people and I I think between Andrew and I, we were on like six panels or, you know, presented like six different times (0:39:26) on stage. Um, and so that that helps to just kind of raise awareness, right? You

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:39:33) reach some new slice of people who weren't aware of smarter web or weren't aware of how we were thinking about (0:39:38) things. Um, and and the benefits of that don't show up immediately, right? Like you're just sort of raising awareness (0:39:44) out there. Um, I would say that, you know, I I was at Vegas, um, where (0:39:50) Andrew, and you were at Vegas, too, um, where Andrew was representing Smarter Web on (0:39:57) his own, uh, you know, made a presentation, which was basically like the the IPO (0:40:03) presentation. Um, and not a ton of people were aware of Smarter Web. I (0:40:09) think that was kind of your experience. you were wearing a hat that that I think I guess you had made because there (0:40:14) Smarter Webb hats didn't exist at that point. Um, yeah, but you know, most people were had had (0:40:21) barely heard of Smarter Web at that point in time, right? And I think fast forward a few months, a lot more people (0:40:27) were aware of Smarter Web. Um, and and that translated into Andrew not being on (0:40:34) stage one time, but Smarter Web being on stage like six times. um and and a much (0:40:39) bigger po part of the global Bitcoin treasury company narrative. Um and and (0:40:46) yeah, so I think we'll see what what comes of the (0:40:52) of that conference over the coming weeks and months. Um (0:40:58) obviously it's it's good to be on stage and present and and you reach a lot of people with that. Um, but then the

**James:**
(0:41:03) conversations that happen immediately after you come off stage are sometimes (0:41:09) the most valuable because those are people who really want to talk to you. And a lot of the time they're just (0:41:15) they're investors who who have questions. They want to meet you. Um, (0:41:20) and when you talk to them that I think that helps build confidence and you know in their investment. Um, and that can (0:41:28) turn into them increasing their positions or it can turn into them, you know, telling their friends or family (0:41:34) more about Smarter Web. There's also, you know, like I had conversations with (0:41:41) a handful of of family office representatives um who were, you know, trying to get (0:41:48) sharp on Bitcoin Treasury companies. Um, some of those are are like cryptonnative (0:41:54) family offices that I think uh, Smarter Convert would be a great fit for. So, you know, we'll see if those (0:42:00) conversations go anywhere. Um, uh, and and then, yeah, and then (0:42:06) obviously you also meet with other, you know, Bitcoin um, uh, ecosystem (0:42:15) uh, infrastructure providers. Um and so that's helpful too (0:42:21) to establish those relationships. Uh yeah, so overall I'd say it was it (0:42:26) was a productive conf conference. um the sort of intangible value of it is is (0:42:32) hard to point at like this is why is the exact value we got out of it. But, you

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:42:38) know, between raising awareness for smarter web generally um and also (0:42:44) starting some potential investor conversations which which by the way hap tend to (0:42:49) happen in the VIP area um for for people who most people haven't been to the VIP (0:42:55) areas for a Bitcoin conference but they're buzzing with like with meetings happening, you know, so (0:43:03) your calendar tends to fill up in between your your uh um speaking time (0:43:09) slots with with uh like hey let's meet in in the deep uh which is the name of (0:43:15) the area and and and and introduce ourselves you know and you sort of just make those contacts and so Andrew and I (0:43:22) did a bunch of those um and and we'll see what comes from from all of that (0:43:28) over the coming months. Cool. Um so you know this is a specific (0:43:35) question but it's it's driven by you know current sentiment etc. Um and I've (0:43:41) seen the question kind of asked in different ways elsewhere. People are looking for a catalyst (0:43:48) uh or a you know what's the thing that's going to end this this downward uh (0:43:55) direction that the share price is going in. um in that it this was asked (0:44:00) specifically across the the whole sector um but I guess it also applies to SWC as well um directly (0:44:09) I'm going to tell you my opinion first and then you can you can jump on but mine is that it takes sentiment to hit

**James:**
(0:44:15) rock bottom in order for the reversal to start um and it's not going to be I mean (0:44:21) caters can help they can speed up the process um but essentially that's because they've lifted the sentiment (0:44:27) Right. So, yeah. Anyway, over to you. What What do you think? Yeah, obviously I've been thinking a lot (0:44:34) about this. Um, I keep thinking about So, I've I've been (0:44:39) in crypto since 2016. Um, a Bitcoin maximalist (0:44:46) 2019. Um, but obviously, you know, Bitcoin, Bitcoin's price movements, I didn't know (0:44:53) it for those first couple years, but Bitcoin's price movements is what drove everything else, right? So, I've been, (0:44:59) you know, watching Bitcoin for quite a while, few cycles. And right now for (0:45:06) smarter web, what it reminds me of very much is late (0:45:12) 2018, early 2019 when um the price for (0:45:17) Bitcoin, you know, it sort of was it had peaked at at uh $20,000 per coin in late (0:45:25) 2017 and then there was a year of it trending down to $6,000 and it and then (0:45:32) it it seemed to be finding like a hard support at $6,000 (0:45:38) and then the bottom fell out of it and dropped to 3,200. Um, and and I was and I had bid orders (0:45:45) set at 2,800 that never filled. Uh, and I ended up buying at like 8 9,000

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:45:51) because I was confident it was going lower. Um anyway, that that period of fear (0:45:59) right then uh is and irrational pessimism (0:46:06) uh where you got into a place where like it was hard to remember why you were (0:46:12) optimistic about this asset. Um and and if anything, there was sort of like a (0:46:17) momentary flip to like people being confident that things were going to go poorly for Bitcoin like over the next (0:46:23) six months, right? like including me. Um that was my first experience with with this sort of market sentiment. So I (0:46:30) think it got me, you know, at that point. And since then I've had more data points of oh this is how that plays out. (0:46:37) This is and and I'm I'm I I don't fall victim to the bottom anymore where I, you know, I first go (0:46:45) through I flipped negative at the bottom. Um, but yeah, that's kind of (0:46:50) like what it takes. If you if you zoom out and think about that classic market cycle of sentiment, (0:46:57) of the pendulum of sentiment swinging, it needs to reach like a a level of (0:47:04) pessimism. Um, that is irrational. Uh, that causes a final capitulation (0:47:13) exhaustion of sellers, right? like you have to exhaust the willing sellers. Um (0:47:19) and that what that takes is is fear and and like you know um the (0:47:26) relentlessness of a downtrend just weighing on people to a point where they

**James:**
(0:47:32) just can't take it anymore and they sell at a place where it's economically irrational. And I think in my book (0:47:40) that's kind of what we've seen very recently because that's why I like to talk about like over the last five weeks (0:47:46) we've added 28% Bitcoin per share and and our current MNAV is 1.66. So that's (0:47:55) a couple months uh of Bitcoin per share compounding (0:48:00) um to to grow into that MNAV if if we're able to do anything like that like what we've done over the last five weeks. Um, (0:48:08) so that seems pretty irrational to me, right? Like like if people are selling at this point in time, they're not in my (0:48:17) book appropriately valuing that capacity for adding Bitcoin per share and and you (0:48:24) know and valuing the company based on that. They're valuing the company based on their fear and um and you know regret (0:48:32) and unwillingness to handle any further downtrend, right? Like the that's kind of the the (0:48:39) psychological place people get into in that moment of like I just can't take another 20% down and so I'm going to cut (0:48:49) my losses and and I'm going to regret it, you know, but but I'm going to get out. (0:48:54) Um, so you know that's what it takes I think for you to exhaust sellers and then once (0:49:03) you've exhausted sellers you know what the classic shape that happens then is (0:49:08) consolidation right like there's there's no more um sellers (0:49:14) uh but there's also not any enthusiasm from buyers for a while right because

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:49:20) people are wondering like is it going to go lower and you kind of go sideways for a bit sideways and slightly up, right? (0:49:27) Um, and then once that trend plays out for a bit, you start to regain the confidence of like, oh, that was the (0:49:33) bottom. And then things can happen pretty quickly. Like that's why I I ended up buying Bitcoin in in May 2019 (0:49:40) at $8,000, $9,000 per coin. And I was pissed that I had waited for 2,800 when (0:49:47) it never came and I could have bought at 3,200. You know, I was so pissed. I still am pissed about that. That was a (0:49:53) big mistake. Um and and of course I've seen several cycles in Bitcoin and altcoins since (0:50:00) then and it all kind of plays out the same, right? Like this is the classic u (0:50:07) psychology of of a market cycle. Um, so it doesn't so all that to say like it (0:50:12) doesn't take anything happening except that you need to exhaust sellers (0:50:18) uh and you need that irrational fear to crescendo and then subside, right? Like (0:50:26) once you've once you've reached a reached like a peak of irrational fear, (0:50:31) there's no place for it to go except down, right? like and fear subsides from there and then you have this sort of (0:50:37) consolidation period and and then and then enthusiasm can slowly return. Of (0:50:43) course, as we talked about with with MetPanet and I think with smarter web these things happen on a very compressed (0:50:49) time frame. So I think you know if we follow Metaplanet trajectory it's like a fourmon market cycle which means you

**James:**
(0:50:57) know I don't know two months of expansion and a month you two months of crash and and then start over right. Um (0:51:04) and at the moment we've had two months of crash so we'll see what comes next.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:51:13) Yeah. Okay. So, um, well, I kind of want to move on to some (0:51:20) potential catalysts, though. Um, two that that are flying really high on the radar right now. Um I mean the economic (0:51:27) data coming out this morning um at your time. Yeah. The unemployment data that (0:51:34) that's kind of looking more towards a September rate cut um which is looking (0:51:43) likely incredibly likely right now. um which is positive for risk on assets, (0:51:48) right? Um but what about STR tonight (0:51:57) inclusion? Oh, right. Has that been announced? No, it's tonight. Uh so it's after close (0:52:03) uh 400 p.m. your time and and so far it's still just rumors, right? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Um (0:52:11) yeah, we Yeah. Uh we'll see. Um, you make a good point though that like, (0:52:19) you know, I I think Bitcoin moves the market like what's happening for Bitcoin (0:52:24) will percolate into enthusiasm for for altcoins, but but also especially (0:52:31) relevant for Bitcoin treasury companies because um when Bitcoin is ripping, (0:52:38) people are going to, you know, be bullish about Bitcoin and they're going to be more interested in how do I get (0:52:44) more exposure to Bitcoin and Bitcoin Treasury companies fit in nicely to that. Um, I think where we are in the (0:52:51) four-year market cycle, there's there's a a fair bit of excitement ahead. um

**James:**
(0:52:58) just based on Bitcoin's having schedule and how that takes 18 months to really (0:53:04) manifest into a a supply shock, a shortage of of available supply that um (0:53:11) causes the price to go higher quickly. Uh and then you layer in that that macro (0:53:17) backdrop of rate cuts coming. Um that will be great for all assets but more (0:53:27) you know most of all for Bitcoin. Um because it means you know inflation (0:53:34) is is coming. Um uh and (0:53:39) and then yeah and you know the the slow relentless march of Bitcoin into the mainstream of finance is going to (0:53:46) continue like and there have been little winds you know there's little wins every (0:53:52) year um whether that's the Fazby guidance being updated that makes (0:53:58) strategy a much more compelling stock um or the OC guidance for banks to be able (0:54:06) to custody crypto for their clients. Um, you know, these little little things in (0:54:12) terms of integration into the financial system, they add up and they create a (0:54:17) tailwind for narratives too and then it becomes kind of self-fulfilling as well. (0:54:22) Um, so basically like the march of time is good for Bitcoin. Uh, and what's good (0:54:28) for Bitcoin is good for Bitcoin treasury companies. Um, and and I think that's especially true when you happen to have

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:54:34) a wave of enthusiasm that I think is is precipitated by Bitcoin's endogenous (0:54:41) supply schedule translating into a supply shock that translates into a bull market. Um, and and I think there's a (0:54:48) fair bit of that ahead, you know, for Bitcoin over the next 6 to 12 months. (0:54:53) Um, and we're going to try to make the most of that. So that's part that's part of why I'm bullish about, you know, the (0:54:59) the fall through the end of the year. Um, and if Bitcoin sentiment, you know, (0:55:06) is is running hot, then smarter web will do really well and and we'll have the (0:55:12) opportunity um to to stack a lot more Bitcoin, you know, (0:55:19) through fundraising, but also through, you know, increasing volume and liquidity in in the um in the ATM style (0:55:27) instrument. So yeah, it's kind of like all all things are good for Bitcoin and (0:55:33) all things that are good for Bitcoin are create a great backdrop for smarter web. (0:55:40) And then you know we spoke earlier about uh cash secure puts on Bitcoin to (0:55:46) potentially generate income or get assigned cheap Bitcoin. Yeah, Bitcoin. (0:55:51) Um the another question came in about uh other ways to generate more cash flow. (0:55:58) So you know Andrew spoken plenty of times about trying to expand the core business. Um (0:56:05) what about the acquisitions? It would would the the aim of an acquisition be

**James:**
(0:56:12) uh to generate more cash? Like is that what we're looking for?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:56:17) Yeah. Um, I think the (0:56:23) the the the first and foremost thing that that uh people don't always see or (0:56:29) think about when they hear about this sort of acquisition strategy um is that (0:56:34) we have a very high bar for what's uh worthwhile because for us the you know (0:56:42) the the hurdle rate is Bitcoin, right? Right. The hurdle rate is accumulating more Bitcoin and then how is that Bitcoin going to perform? We think it's (0:56:48) going to be a 30 to 50% keer, you know, for for the the next decade, right? Um (0:56:55) so you have so if you're thinking about allocating capital elsewhere, it has to it has to either monetarily (0:57:04) outperform that or it needs to have strategic value (0:57:09) that is greater than that. Right? And that's a really high bar. (0:57:14) uh and we're open to and we want to find uh you know something that that meets (0:57:21) that bar because that would be great. Um but you know that that's what investors (0:57:27) should be aware of when it comes to our acquisition strategies that we're we're not thinking like hey let's just (0:57:33) accumulate any business. We're thinking this has to be better than than buying (0:57:39) Bitcoin and has to be better than a 30% Kager which nothing is basically. So um

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:57:48) you know it and there's there can be some strategic value to u to an an (0:57:55) acquisition in the sense that you know it it you know it could provide some (0:58:01) operating income and be structured in a way where we don't have to you know we don't have to (0:58:08) put any Bitcoin to work. It could be structured in a you know all stock um (0:58:14) and and and delayed payment um structure that's funded by the operations of the (0:58:20) acquisition target into the future. Um but again it's a really really high bar. (0:58:26) Um and you know we're also aware that like management time and management focus should be on Bitcoin um and (0:58:33) accumulating Bitcoin. So that also factors into how how high of a bar it is. Um, you know, my personal vision is (0:58:42) that, you know, you you run the Bitcoin treasury company strategy for a long time, uh, accumulate a massive balance (0:58:49) sheet, uh, and then there may become opportunities in the future to, you know, strategically add, um, functions (0:58:58) basically that that could be strategically um, synergistic with (0:59:04) having a large balance sheet. So, you know, in the spirit of how do you (0:59:10) execute on growing Bitcoin yield in an in sort of a future state where you have 200,000 Bitcoin, right? Like what do you (0:59:17) do then to to keep funding fueling your growth? Um, I don't know. But I could (0:59:23) see a world where like acquiring a business that that has synergistic value

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:59:28) for helping to provide, you know, more ways to add Bitcoin yield could be (0:59:34) attractive at that point in time. But like all that to say like our focus is on accumulating the best treasury (0:59:40) asset in the history of the world and allocating capital is seen through that (0:59:47) lens. Right. And and it's a very very high bar for any acquisition target.

**James:**
(0:59:54) Well, Jesse, I'd love to keep you on. Um particularly because the share price is pumping while we're talking.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:60:02) Sounds nice.

**James:**
Uh, I think it's between 130 and 135 in the UK now. So, it's about 14% something (0:60:08) like that.

**Jesse Myers:**
Um, I I I boy I I I'll you know, you you can tell, but I think it's uh a screaming (0:60:17) buy at this point. um for you know for just based on our our metrics and what I (0:60:23) think and that I think we will be able to continue to deliver Bitcoin yield and (0:60:29) then if you run any kind of math on that of like you know say we're say we're able to deliver 10% Bitcoin per uh yield (0:60:37) per month for you know the foreseeable future. So like significantly less than (0:60:42) we have. doesn't take long um with those numbers for you to be, you know, in a (0:60:48) Bitcoin gained position versus versus your upfront investment at at you know, (0:60:54) whatever the MNAV is right now, 1.7. Um, so you know what I I (0:61:02) and that's why I'm like that's a big part of why I'm I'm quite confident that you know we're we have reached some (0:61:08) state of market irrationality because uh (0:61:14) you know people are are emotional and and sentiment drives you know near-term (0:61:20) price action I think but you know ultimately the market is a weighing machine and and the econom economics of (0:61:27) what we have been doing and I think will continue to do um are pretty incredible (0:61:33) when you compare that to any other opportunity in the public market investable universe.

**James:**
(0:61:40) Awesome. Thank you very much, Jesse. Really appreciate your time. Uh and I look forward to seeing everyone else (0:61:45) next week.

**Jesse Myers:**
Thanks, James.
