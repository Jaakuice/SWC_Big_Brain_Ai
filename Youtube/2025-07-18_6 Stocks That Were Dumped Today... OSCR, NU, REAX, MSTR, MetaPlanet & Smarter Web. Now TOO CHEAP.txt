**Host:**
(0:00:00) Hello everybody. So today is the third Friday of the month. It is a big options expiration day which means that we often get weird price action. I'm going to use the word weird to describe this price action, right? Because for example Tesla was up very nicely on the day. Not the case unfortunately for Strategy which was probably ATMing and we have a few other companies that are on sale right now. And I want to go through a few of them.

(0:00:32) So, the first company that is definitely a sell is Oscar. I find Oscar just too cheap. You may remember the retail hype, quote unquote. This stock was trending on X a few weeks ago. Everybody was bidding it up up to $18, $17. Well, it's way down. It seems like the stock is down because it's had a flurry of downgrades by major banks. What the banks think seem to really impact the price of Oscar and of course it is grouped into this government program type healthcare and the sentiment right now on government programs is oh cuts cuts cuts there's going to be a bunch of cuts. Oscar is not going to get the subsidies renewed and since they don't get the subsidies renewed they are going to be hurting even though they've told us that the guidance did not assume for renewal of these subsidies, the ACA subsidies, so the extra on top subsidies.

(0:01:34) So anyways, it's noise if you're a long-term investor. It's likely noise and you know, no financial advice, but in my view, this is likely noise as a long-term investor and the narrative may change two weeks from now. What is not noise is the facts. So the facts is if you look at this company, it's 10xed its revenue in next to no time. In a matter of what is it 5 years, four years, it more than 10xed its revenue. The growth has been stellar. The growth actually if you look at past 12 months growth it was 42%. That's how fast they grew. The stock is trading at a ridiculous, I mean it's only a fraction of the forward revenue is what this stock is trading at, only a fraction of its forward revenue.

(0:02:19) And you know, I have to be faithful to my spreadsheet, which is why do I like the stock? Well, I only like the stock because it's cheap. Because if this on enterprise value over gross profit over revenue growth, if this stock was trading at like a 0.2, I wouldn't be interested. But this stock is trading at a 0.16. It's the second cheapest stock ever found on my spreadsheet in the history of the channel. The cheapest one being Bio Stem. Second cheapest is this one in the entire history of the channel.

(0:02:50) And you know, I understand why because it's a business that I don't want to be in. I don't like that business very much because any changes to the ACA can hurt Oscar. But I think this is more than priced in. And the business of course of Oscar, the classic take about a new business in the health insurance sector is that they use technology to have a low medical loss ratio. Medical loss ratio is the difference between the premiums that you take in and the payouts that you give out. And they use tech to make that lower and lower. And they probably use tech to deny certain claims and try to steer patients towards one option over another option etc. They use tech to lower the cost, decrease the medical loss ratio and then boom you create profits.

(0:03:35) Something a little bullish about Oscar too is that as far as I see the new bill and the new budget, the cuts are mostly impacting Medicaid and the whole idea of if you're able-bodied you can't have Medicaid anymore. At least that's the idea of the cuts. Like I said, it's not a business that I like. So I don't study too closely. Knowing that it's cheap is good enough for me with this stock. And cheap. And really in my view, it's very tough for it to get cheaper than this.

(0:04:04) But anyways, a lot of people seem to think that these Medicaid cuts actually could be good for Oscar because what happens if you lose Medicaid? Well, what's the next option, right? The marketplace. An Affordable Care Act plan is probably the next option if you lose Medicaid and you still want to have insurance. So, a lot of people seem to think they could actually benefit from the current administration cutting Medicaid. Not a business that I like, but a valuation that I absolutely love. And this is why I like Oscar very much at 13.

(0:04:37) Moving on to NuBank. NuBank is one of, whenever I do a video on NuBank, it's one of the least viewed videos of the channel. NuBank is kind of a SoFi of Latin America I guess I'm going to say. In fact, for the longest time they used to trade kind of in line with SoFi. Not in stock price but in valuation. The way I value these stocks, their valuation used to be very similar for a little bit of time. NuBank was growing actually faster than SoFi. That has changed a little bit. NuBank's growth has stalled a little bit but not too much. And the stock hasn't moved. I mean this stock is essentially still at its IPO price. Still at the IPO price. We have a stock price who's roughly the same.

(0:05:22) When I look at explanations for that, of course it's the leading neo-bank in Brazil, but they are in four other Latin American countries. They just got a banking license in Mexico for example. But when I look at their main country of operation, Brazil, if I look at the exchange rate, well guess what? Since their IPO, the exchange rate has roughly been flat, right? It hasn't changed. If you look at the price of the Brazilian real in dollar, it hasn't changed. They've been trading roughly hand in hand. Over the long term, I expect of course the real to trade down compared to the dollar over the long run and even then that's not a guarantee. Even then that's not a guarantee because the money printing of the dollar is very very strong right now. So even then I wouldn't be so sure. The point is it's been flat. So I can't really explain the stock price not doing much for three and a half four years. I can't really explain that based on the exchange rate.

(0:06:17) What I see is a stock that hasn't moved and I see a company whose number of customers is through the roof, right? They have 119 million customers. The growth has been steady and they've been growing the average revenue per user steadily at a nice clip. So this is a steady Eddie stock. This is a sleep well at night stock. It's cheap. It hasn't moved. At some point, when you have a coiled spring, at some point it pops. And that's my thesis for NuBank. The stock was down today quite a bit, of course, and I consider that price to be low right now.

(0:06:52) Let's talk about the Real Brokerage. I've made a full analysis for the Real Brokerage and I've also addressed it in two videos. I am wanting to bet on a return of the housing market. Yes, the housing market's going to come back. People have been waiting to change homes and we haven't had much in the way of real estate for the past 3 years. But Powell's going away. He's going away, you know, at the very least in May. So, we have 10 months to go, right? Maybe earlier. Some people hope earlier. And of course, whoever replaces Powell will be the most dovish of the doves. You literally have a dove in a suit at the Fed who's going to take the rates down, which means real estate's going to go back up, which means the market's going to anticipate that real estate picks back up. And thus, I got to pick a winner in the space.

(0:07:43) You may have seen OpenDoor doubled in three days. Well, unfortunately for me, I didn't get back into OpenDoor. That was one of the stocks that I had sold. I was very big on OpenDoor back in the day. Now, I am kind of betting on REAX, the Real Brokerage. They're the faster growing company. They're attracting the top agents of traditional brick and mortar brokers and they're attracting them on the app. And of course, the app can scale. The app has fixed operation costs. It doesn't have buildings. It doesn't have employees or very little, very few employees. There's employees, but very few and they only work on AI.

(0:08:20) And the way I look at the Real Brokerage, they've set up a business that you're kind of able to go after the top agents, the bread and butter of your local brokerage firm in your local community. Real Brokerage is going after that top agent and they're going after them by having a really good incentive program, by offering them stock in the company and by especially taking a smaller cut. And that's how they've been able to grow while real estate transactions are way down in the US over the past few years. They're way down these transactions and of course a brokerage makes money on transaction count, right? How many transactions you have, you make your 3%.

(0:08:58) Well, they've been growing in a very high headwind environment. They've been growing revenue nicely. They've been growing number of agents nicely. They are EBITDA profitable which is very nice at 40 million for one full quarter and their transactions are also going up nicely. Everything I see is a green flag on this one. Forward revenue is 45%. Right? That's my prediction, my number for the next 12 months. And of course, CB margin is 3%, gross margin is 9%. That may sound really bad, but it's the industry. It's this industry, right? On the other hand, you know, look at the revenue, right? Revenue is huge, right? But you're going to trade only at a fraction of revenue. So for that industry, it's how we have to judge it.

(0:09:45) It's fine. It could go up. They're moving into ancillary services like title and all that sort of stuff which could help them make more money. But I see a strong momentum in that company. I think they could be bigger and I think they could be a good bet on the recovery of real estate which inevitably happens when the Fed's going to drop rates and the Fed is going to drop rates in my view.

(0:10:06) Moving on to other deals of the day. Bitcoin was down nicely today. So today, as far as I'm concerned, was a good day to add to Bitcoin Treasury companies. Three stocks to discuss.

(0:10:18) Strategy was down a good 6% today. Saylor was likely using the ATM today. He was likely ATMing because it was down way more of course than the price of Bitcoin and it was down more than the other, you know, higher beta riskier Bitcoin treasury companies like MetaPlanet or Smarter Web. MSTR was down more. So, this is telling me that he likely ATMed and good for him because he ATMed at nearly 1.7. That's good enough for me. As long as he ATMs at 1.5, I'm happy. So, he was ATMing. So, let's expect a big buy probably on Monday. And he probably wants to go strong before the earnings call, before the conference call. So, that's very positive to me. As a long-term shareholder, I'm perfectly fine with a small drop of 6%. That's really nothing.

(0:11:07) Moving on to MetaPlanet. MetaPlanet was slightly down on the day, ever so slightly. MetaPlanet is as cheap as it's been in recent months. It's trading at a 3x price to NAV. So I think there could be an interesting multiple expansion opportunity in MetaPlanet because this stock has been able to acquire Bitcoin at a much faster pace. The fact that they operate in the Japanese market is very appealing. The people of Japan are yield starved. They want high returns. They can't buy Bitcoin outright without paying a bunch of taxes when they sell. They have to own it in a retirement account. There's a lot of reasons as to why the Japanese market probably warrants a premium on a price to NAV and right now I don't think that's reflected.

(0:11:52) And frankly the price to NAV at 3x is very fair right now for MetaPlanet because the stock has been growing Bitcoin much faster than Strategy, much much faster than Strategy. And of course the fastest horse, the fastest of them all is the Smarter Web Company. The fastest of the companies with more than a thousand Bitcoins I'm going to call it like that. Out of the companies who have more than a thousand Bitcoin, they are the fastest.

(0:12:17) So kudos to Nick Bitcoin B21. That's a great website for Smarter Investment Guy. You can look at the speed at which Smarter Web has been able to grow the Bitcoin, growing very fast, much faster, a much steeper curve. Now don't forget we're going to go asymptotic in a while, right? I don't expect and you can really see the beginning of the flattening of the curve. They're going to flatten in a while. That's for sure. But it still shows how strong they've started. How strong they've started compared to two other companies that I like very much, which is MetaPlanet and Strategy at the top right there.

(0:12:54) So I like the direction. I like the speed. I looked at the announcements. They've done another capital raise today to the best of what I can say, something like 17 million pounds or something like that. So we should get an announcement soon about more buys and them growing the stack. And same on a price to NAV basis. The Smarter Web Company is kind of the cheapest since they kind of IPOed, right? It's like in May, in early May we had something about as cheap on the price to NAV basis as 5. We're back at a 5.

(0:13:27) Out of the six weeks that we're looking at right now, maybe five or five weeks, four to five weeks out of the six, we had a price to NAV that was much higher for Smarter Web Company. So I consider it cheap as well right now even though it dropped 5.7%. I consider it pretty cheap.

(0:13:43) And of course let me conclude with that. It's the third Friday of the month. Weird things happen in markets on the third Friday of the month, you know, people got to cover their trades. People got to sell what's available, etc. Bitcoin dropped all day. All day it dropped and next thing you know, when the markets close, what do you see? Bitcoin bounces back up. So, I am optimistic as to the performance of Bitcoin over the weekend. Although, I honestly don't care because it's short-term and short-term does not matter to me and does not matter to the viewer of this channel. We are a long-term investment channel.

(0:14:19) You know, if you don't want to own anything Bitcoin related for more than four years, you shouldn't own it at all, to quote Michael Saylor. And of course, you should not listen to anything I say because this is only entertainment. This is not investment advice. This is not financial advice. This is just entertainment.
