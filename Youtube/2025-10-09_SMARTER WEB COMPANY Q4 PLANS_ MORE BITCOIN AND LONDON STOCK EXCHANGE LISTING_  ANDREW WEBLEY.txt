**The Bitcoin Libertarian:**
(0:01:16) Hello, this is the Bitcoin Libertarian. Our guest today is Andrew Webley. Andrew is the CEO of the Smarter Web Company, a London listed technology firm that's making waves as the UK's largest publicly traded company holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Andrew brings a wealth of experience in digital strategy and financial innovation. A passionate Bitcoin investor posting in his personal capacity on X where he boasts over 8,000 followers. Andrew is at the forefront of blending web development progress with Bold Treasury Strategies. Today we will talk about the latest news on his company and the insights he got from the latest conference he attended together with future plans of the smarter web company. Andrew, welcome.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:02:09) Thank you. Nice to see you again. Nice to see you again. Nice to have you in again in our in our streaming. We have streaming then on the city now.

**The Bitcoin Libertarian:**
(0:02:17) New streaming and let's see if we can do another walking around the city soon, but not here in Hong Kong. Let's see what happens.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:02:23) Yeah, like we we'll have to try and get that organized, but I'm optimistic that we will.

**The Bitcoin Libertarian:**
(0:02:31) Let's see. Let's go. Let's go. So, Andrew, it's been a couple of months, like not less than two months since we talked last time here in Hong Kong. I want to ask how many bitcoins now the company is holding. Last time we met was 2,440. Now, how much Bitcoin do you have?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:02:50) Yes. So, we put an announcement out um three hours ago in the UK. We hold 2,550. So the announcement that we put out this morning was only a small buy, 25 Bitcoin. Yesterday morning we announced the update to our ATM style facility, which is, you know, where where the money came from, for the 25 Bitcoin. And we also announced a placing yesterday morning, which will settle on Thursday. And so that will be a larger amount of Bitcoin that we'll be adding soon. So, so yeah, we've been, you know, we've been adding what we can when we can. You know, it's quite cool that we're over 2,500 Bitcoin now. I think that makes us 29th in the world in terms of, you know, Bitcoin held. We're still the biggest in the UK. We're still bigger than everyone else in the UK added together. And we're determined to expand that lead.

**The Bitcoin Libertarian:**
(0:03:54) Yeah, many many competitors have have come in the last weeks. There was a a Brazilian company that just went out of the blue with more than 3,000 Bitcoin and a lot of support from Adam Back and other investors and how things have been going since we met last time until today. You attended two conferences, you've been meeting new investors, you appointed a new CFO. Tell us about these developments.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:04:27) Yeah, so we've we've been really busy. So, in terms of the the staff, we appointed the new CFO, Albert. He's been great so far. You know, in terms of helping us with the various different projects that we're doing. That's that's been really good. Last week we announced a new non-executive director, Randall. He's joined our board and he was present on the board meeting that we had yesterday. And you know he's going to be a tremendous asset to the company as well. Really well experienced. You know, very good on audit, corporate governance, all these sorts of things. So yeah, that that's really important. That's something that people, you know, they they see when we announce it, but they I don't think everyone realizes the importance of all of these different individuals in terms of everything that we actually have to do. So that makes things much better. And the announcement that we put out yesterday morning I think is really important as well because one of the things that we've been saying for the last couple of months is how hard we've been working on attracting the institutional capital. And now people can start to see that some of these investors are starting to commit you know relatively modest at the moment. You know, it was 8 million pounds committed by this one investor you know to the strategy and to the business. So that's good to see as well.

And like I've said to everyone at all times, you know, these things take time. I think maybe we could get on to sort of the different types of capital that you can use and the different ways that you can structure that. Because I think there's a little bit of confusion around that with various different investors or people see things in different ways. But we're convinced that you know as we're structuring these things it's the right way of doing it for the benefit of everyone and the company. You know so yeah, we're quite pleased with how it's all going. Obviously since we met you know in Hong Kong for the Bitcoin Asia conference which was great. You know, it has been a tough time in the markets. It's been harder to raise capital. MNAVs have been compressed. You know, I personally believe that we're getting to the end of that now and things are going to look a lot better. From now I think you can already see in the Bitcoin price, you know, October kicking in. You know, Bitcoin's probably what 10% higher than it was a week ago, something like that at the moment. You know and I think it looks incredibly strong and I'm very much looking forward to the next couple of months. But you know in Bitcoin Treasury land it's been quite hard for most people. But what we've shown people is even when things are hard, we've still been generating Bitcoin yield. We've still been adding Bitcoin. We've still been raising capital. We've still been coming up with new products, you know, some of which we probably haven't sort of publicly announced yet.

So we've certainly not been standing still in terms of the company itself. We've been building out the team. We've been pushing this very very important project forward that we've got for the near future. So I think that's probably, you know, what you need to watch if you're an investor in the space is if you look at companies when things are tough and the market's harder. I think that's when you want to see companies doing stuff because anyone can do stuff when you know capital's flowing freely and you know people's risk level is sky high you know but when markets are contracting a bit and you've got to work a lot harder for the money I think that that's when you separate out the good companies from the bad companies.

**The Bitcoin Libertarian:**
(0:08:24) Yes. Yes. Because since I remember since the peak of the treasury companies that was around July something like that I don't remember when I interviewed you for first time all the companies were super high then it went down and we saw this and the Nakamoto share that dropped from 16 US now today is $1 US dollar with MNAV minor to to one. What is your message for the investors navigating this rough times that are happening with the stocks going down, MNAV compression and all these things that probably bring some FUD because now the critics come when things go down many people say oh I told you this was a scam this can't be sustainable. How do you react to all these things in this moment?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:09:22) Yeah. So, I think it's important and this is what we've been working really hard at for these last couple of months is to try and explain what the model is, you know, how does this work? What should investors be looking for? What should they be aware of in terms of risks? You know, and there are a number of things that you need to look at, but one of the most if not the most important thing is Bitcoin yield, you know, so you know, you and I can go out and we can buy some Bitcoin today and we can hold that however we want to hold it forever. Yeah. Nice. So a Bitcoin treasury company can buy Bitcoin and then it can use capital markets to increase the capital that it's got available to it and effectively offer compound Bitcoin. So I think what everyone needs to do is they need to say well why am I investing in this company? What what's the point of it? So, you know, if you can invest in a company that is well-run, that is delivering a positive Bitcoin yield every single quarter forever, then to me that's a lot more attractive than just holding Bitcoin. Because you're getting compound Bitcoin, you know, like even if the Bitcoin yield, let's say, a company delivers 20% Bitcoin yield a year. You know that that is better than holding Bitcoin in my opinion. And so I think investors need to sort of think to themselves well you know what's my time scale? What am I trying to achieve? You know do I understand what I'm investing in? I've got zero doubt in our company that you know we've got the model right? And we're delivering value. And we're doing it as best we can in a very very competitive market at the moment.

We've avoided a lot of the things that some of the companies have participated in which you know let's be honest have contributed to the problems in the market. You know the sort of the pipe deals we had one of those in the UK absolutely shocking. You know not we had one of those in the UK the UK had one of these. You know and there's been multiple ones in the US and they were always going to end like they've ended you know but hopefully lessons will be learned and people will be more responsible in terms of the capital strategies in the future because it's our job running these companies to obviously deliver the return for our shareholders but also to do the right thing in the wider context so that you know the regulators the investors etc you know, are still, you know, keen on the space forever, you know. So yeah, it's been a very interesting two months and, you know, I think that we've, you know, we've done okay in quite a tough time actually. But I'm very much looking forward to the next few months. I think it's going to get a lot better, a lot you know, better and it will be pretty quick as well.

**The Bitcoin Libertarian:**
(0:12:36) Yes. Because the I think that the problem first problem is that not many people understand how the treasury companies work. Probably people from the financial markets background see the companies growing very fast. They put money and then they don't understand and they measure the returns on fiat. Oh, it's dropping. But on the same time, they don't see that the Bitcoin per share is getting higher. And another problem is that as the treasury companies the price of the stock not the bitcoin yield gets better when the bitcoin is volatile and nowadays in the last months bitcoin became boring was not volatile. So, and talking about the competition because you talk about that the competitive market more and more and more companies are coming to the market. No, to fight for capital and to buy more Bitcoin. We said and we spoke in our last episode in Hong Kong that of course you were like collaborating because a company that buys Bitcoin makes the price going up and make the price of the company goes up. On the other side there is a competition for the capital for the investor. How what is SWC doing to attract more investors in these times of more competition among Bitcoin treasury companies?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:14:05) Yes. So what we do is you know well first and foremost I believe that any company that wants to add Bitcoin to its balance sheet is a very positive thing. And that's what I want to see, public or private company. What I don't want to see is I don't want to see public companies pretending to add Bitcoin to the balance sheet or not doing it in the way that I believe it should be done, which is to generate Bitcoin yield. Or worse still, you know, effectively misleading people about what they're actually doing. I think that sucks. So that aside, you know, the overall statement is that the more companies adding Bitcoin to the balance sheet, the better. Now, you're right, there's only one problem of that happening, and that's capital markets, you know, in different parts of the world are different. And if you take the UK for example, you know, there is, you know, there's a smaller amount of capital than a lot of people realize in the equity markets, you know, in the smaller cap equity markets as well. So for example, one of our ambitions is to move to the LSE at which point we'd probably qualified to be in the Footsie 250. So then you know without doing anything else you know the capital that you've got available to you is significantly better you know I've had some investors say to me that they cannot invest in us you this is institutional investors because they cannot invest in an Aquis stock you know. So there's things like that that you have to work around and then you have to work out solutions for those things. You know which is all stuff that we're doing but all you really have to do is you have to get out there and speak to investors and explain what the model is, you know, what you're trying to achieve, why you think that they should trust you with their capital. And then once you do get trusted with that, you then have to deliver.

So, you know, like the competition thing is, you know, on one hand, it's terrible because, you know, if there isn't any competition, then there's no one else going after that same capital as you. And particularly when some of the people do it in sort of quite horrible ways which you know we haven't done ourselves I'd like to add. But then on the other side of things you know if you haven't got that competition you know it's not necessarily being a great thing if you're the only company doing something you know so I think that's something to be mindful of. But then also with something like Bitcoin you know and this is when you then go back into, you know, talking about Bitcoin itself rather than Bitcoin treasury companies. You know, if no one else cares about this particular asset, you know, in our case, Bitcoin, then, you know, the price is always going to be less than if everyone wants to get involved in it as well. So, you know, the funny thing that we've got is, you know, the competitors that we've got for capital are effectively trying to get the capital and buy it with the same thing that we're going to buy anyway.

So yeah, all I'm trying to do myself is to try and get the right messages out there, you know, so that people understand not just what we're doing, but they understand the sector. And things like the metrics. That's why I talk about the metrics so much. And then I'm just hopeful that, you know, we get some other competition in the UK. I'm looking forward to the day when there's a company out there that's, you know, sort of, you know, saying, right, you know, we're trying to deliver Bitcoin yield as well. You know, this is our number and then we can spar off each other a little bit. I think that would make my life quite a lot easier actually. Quite good because I think that when you talk with these all seasoned investors on the stock market, you need to explain all these metrics and they probably say you need to most of them probably they don't understand they don't even understand Bitcoin. So you need to go from a full course.

**The Bitcoin Libertarian:**
(0:18:22) Yeah. Yeah. So so I think it was about two weeks ago we were in America. You went to the Bitcoin Uncon conference that was great. And then you spent two days speaking to investors which was great as well. And a lot of those investors, you know, most of them are getting, you know, the high level reasons why Bitcoin's so great. Some of those investors are starting to get things like MNAV, but they don't really understand like if you've got two companies, both with say like a 1.3 MNAV or something, you know, they can be completely different companies, you know, like the size matters, the yield matters, the trajectory that they're on matters, the management team matters, you know, all these things matter. And so you need to look at all of these metrics, but I suspect that this will be something that will take many many years for the majority of institutional and retail investors to understand it. And I think what may happen is so if you look at our company as a good example, we're quite close to the end of our financial year, which is in you know, three weeks time or something, the end of the month.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:19:42) Yes. And then a few months later our statutory results will come out. So obviously I can't talk about the finer details but I can talk about what people could work out as they look at the publicly available information. And if you look at the gain on our Bitcoin the pounds gain you know something like 30 million pounds at the moment. So that would be an unrealized profit of 30 million pounds for effectively what's a six-month period. And when those sorts of figures start to go out to the wider non-Bitcoin focused investment community, they'll see the power of the model, you know, and how unbelievably profitable a business that's run in the right way, that's following a strategy like ours can be. So yeah, all of this stuff's going to take, you know, years. You know, I've signed up to doing this for the rest of my life. And I think that whilst we've had quite an interesting year so far this year, I think everyone needs to understand that, you know, this is, you know, this is a marathon. This isn't a sprint. This is a marathon. And like I say, it's a marathon where you also need to sprint every single day.

**The Bitcoin Libertarian:**
(0:21:02) Yes, that's something that we the Bitcoiners really understand. But then we need to teach that's what we are doing this to teach the no coiners or the investor the difference between the regular capital markets Bitcoin and now the Bitcoin treasury company and how was the experience in New York because I saw the streaming a few speeches because was while the time I was sleeping here in Hong Kong. How was the experience? Did you get good connections overall?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:21:45) Yeah, it was a great conference actually. So Tim who organized it did a fantastic job. Yeah, I've got a lot of time for him. Yeah, it was really well done. The production side of things was great as well. So one thing that I thought was really good was the production quality for the people that weren't there. So that you know I think at its peak it was something like 200,000 people were watching it. Which is incredible if you think about how many people that is you know fifth of a million people. So yeah it was very good. There was probably I don't know 300 400 people I don't know the number of people there you know and that was a real mixture of some investors some Bitcoin treasury companies some people trying to sell things to them. You know people that produced the podcasts, you know, all different people that really care about this one specific part of Bitcoin and yeah, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I managed to spend the whole day there and I sat through almost every single speech that was done and almost every single panel that took place.

So it was really enjoyable for me to be able to sit there and listen, you know, to, you know, all the different people talking about things, that are, you know, something that I think about all the time. And, for me, the big takeaway from the event was, you know, whilst, you know, we've got to a quite a good position so far as a business, you know, so early. You know, it really is early. You know, where we're going to be in one year, two years, three years. It's mindblowing really. So yeah, I absolutely loved the day. It was great. And I was also able to catch up with a number of our early investors who were there and it was nice to spend a bit of time with them and to hear how supportive they are. You know, they're like me. They're focused on the mission. They've enjoyed seeing the price, you know, creep up bit less so it come down, but you know, they've got that same sort of duration that I've got of, you know, this is a multi-year thing. You know in terms of what we're trying to do here.

**The Bitcoin Libertarian:**
(0:24:08) And what was the experience because after the New York conference you flew to near here to Singapore to the Token 2049 for me was something surprise that people from Token 2049 are interested in Bitcoin treasury companies because you know I'm a Bitcoin maximalist so you probably might know what I think from Token 2049. But how was the experience to talk to the crypto ecosystem about the treasury companies? Were they interested? The questions that they asked were different. Tell us about that.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:24:52) Yeah, it was really interesting actually. So you know I've done a lot of traveling the last couple of weeks and you know I must admit I was quite tired going to Singapore. You know it's sort of you know everyone thinks that you know it's sort of quite a great life you know going to but it is quite tiring. So yeah I was slightly tired and I enjoyed it in lots of ways but I didn't enjoy it as much as Hong Kong for example like Hong Kong was probably one of the best conferences that I've been to it was smaller than say the other Bitcoin conference in Vegas earlier in the year. You know it was bigger than the one that I was talking about in New York. The New York one was an excellent conference. So yeah it was different in terms of the support of Bitcoin. So this is there's a few things to say there. So most of the people that I speak to or I've spoke to at the conference behind the scenes, the people, you know, that are the sort of the key decision makers in lots of different businesses, that they pretty much all come out and they say they're Bitcoin maxis.

You know, so you know, I think that's one thing that's worth remembering. The other thing that was fascinating for me was I took part in a couple of panel discussions. And these companies are only just starting to understand some of the things that we've learned about Bitcoin treasury companies. So in in they call them DATs. Yeah. Digital asset treasuries. So in DAT land you know they think that they're just sort of getting to grips with all of these things, but you know we're you know two, three, four times ahead of them in our world, Bitcoin Treasury land. So that's quite interesting and I think if you were an experienced investor who understands Bitcoin treasury companies, well, I think that, you know, if you like obviously I would never invest in these DATs because I don't believe in their asset. I think it's fundamentally flawed in terms of a treasury management approach. But let's say you did believe in their assets. I think you could actually do quite well in that space because you can see a lot of the things that you know have and haven't happened in Bitcoin treasury land in there. So I think there'll be a lot of learning. It'd be interesting to see whether these companies credit the Bitcoin treasury space with like learning the lessons. I did hear one large Ethereum treasury company talk about something and you know in a very positive way and I was thinking oh you definitely don't want to do that you know.

But there is one thing I will say though which is quite interesting not that I want to defend you know any other company but you know I'll always speak the truth and you know whether it's what I believe or not there is a school of thought on Ethereum that there is a benefit to that ignoring the fact that I don't believe that it's a treasury asset of course but looking past that because of the way that it's easier to generate that yield on that and that's not the Bitcoin yield that we talk about but that's effectively putting your Ethereum at risk. There is a school of thought that that is quite a helpful attribute to that asset class in terms of you know running a public company. So yeah it was interesting the takeaway coming away from it is my investment thesis of Bitcoin and nothing else has remained firmly intact. So if anyone was worried that I was going to get swayed into coins, they can put those fears to bed.

**The Bitcoin Libertarian:**
(0:29:08) Yeah, because I saw some comments on X saying, "How come Andrew is going to this shitcoin conference? What is happening?" But I think that and sometimes we talk with Diego my business partner that you met here in Hong Kong as well that it's good to go to this conference even though you don't share their ethos but it's good to learn and to see what is happening and see the ideas and again probably like when you go there you come with more force with more strength believing in Bitcoin and there were many companies that are doing treasuries with other digital assets there.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:29:44) Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Quite a few in fact. Yeah, I believe in free speech at the end of the day and you know if people have got a different opinion to me then you know that's great as long as they can communicate with respect and you know without violence then you know that's all good as far as I'm concerned. You know, in fact, I'd prefer that people say what they believe in. So I went to Token because, you know, I wanted to go and put Bitcoin treasury companies in front of a wider audience and I wanted to, you know, explain what we're doing at the Smarter Web Company, you know, in that context. So, it certainly wasn't a wasted trip in that regard. I met some people over there that may be interested in supporting us with some of the things that we do like Smarter Convert for example. You know and so yeah, it was definitely worth doing. But it wasn't I personally didn't enjoy it as much as some of the other conferences that I've been to recently. But as I said at the start perhaps that was because I was a little bit tired perhaps.

**The Bitcoin Libertarian:**
(0:31:04) Yeah, people think that when you travel a lot is oh you are doing an amazing life and it happened to me around 2017 we were traveling a lot to different digital marketing conferences and I think that in one month and a half I've been to Turkey to Amsterdam to Singapore and when I came back from the last trip I say I don't want to travel for at least two months or three months because I was super tired.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:31:34) Yeah. Yeah. And it's you know like you know obviously I've got family as well and you know it's hard for them you know so but I think other than I've got quite a few days in London coming up over the course of October but I've said to them that I'll try and minimize any overseas trips until October's out the way.

**The Bitcoin Libertarian:**
(0:31:58) Yes. But at the end of the day, it's good to travel because it's different when you go and meet in person and talk to the investors in person or potential investor in person instead of doing a web call or a zoom or something like that and you get exposure, you get known from the people. I think that at the end of the day besides that we have a lot of now technological things we can do, we can do whatever like we are doing now. Nothing replace the person to person meeting is totally different.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:32:29) Oh, I completely agree. Yeah. Yeah, I completely agree. We're lucky to be able to do it like this, but you know, you have to go out and see people.

**The Bitcoin Libertarian:**
(0:32:36) Excellent. Excellent. And talking about let me ask a couple of questions that the people from the group. But by the way, what do you think about the community? Because the Smarter Web community in X the X group is amazing. They are super supportive. They are all day talking about that talking about the giving information. What do you think about them?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:32:55) Oh, I'm so proud of our community. You know, we've got the third biggest Bitcoin treasury company community in the world. Only MetaPlanet and Strategy have bigger communities than us. So, I'm immensely proud of them. You know, it's 100% genuine organic. You know, it's not like, you know, we haven't got anyone that works, you know, sort of for the company that's moderating the community or doing anything like that. You know, that would be wrong. So yeah, I'm really proud of them. I check in most days to see what they're doing. Every now and then there's something that's sort of, you know, quite out there that is quite entertaining to see. I don't agree with everything that they say. But you know, that's all good as far as I'm concerned and I would encourage more things that I wouldn't necessarily agree with because if someone says to me 10 different things and then within those 10 things, there's one thing that we can sort of take as a company and it benefits us then, you know, that's amazing.

So we're really lucky to have such a supportive group of investors and you know, there's nuggets of stuff in there that when I'm trolling through to see what's going on that I can sort of, you know, take and incorporate into the strategy as well.

**The Bitcoin Libertarian:**
(0:34:27) Yeah, this is the magic of the social media like when we post probably you can even a person that has 100 followers on X can bring a good idea for the company that you can execute and is better and for on my side I have I want to say thank you to the people of the community. They are super supportive of my job or what I do. They always tag me. There is a guy that every day at 7:00 a.m. posts a long post and tags me. So, and when I comment good morning and they say you are the Hong Kong guy, they know me that I am the Hong Kong guy. So, it's funny even though I'm not an investor because I can't I feel part of the community. So, let's move to some questions that the people left there. Ah, one of the thing that I was I want to ask before do you have any plans to get listed in the London Stock Exchange? You are in the process or you cannot talk about that?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:35:28) Yeah. So, according to the lawyers, I'm not allowed to talk about that, but what they've said I can say is that we've got aspirations of listing on the London Stock Exchange. And I think that's all that I can say on such okay.

**The Bitcoin Libertarian:**
(0:35:41) So, and the questions are this. Scottish Mick says, I just want to thank him personally from us all. We see how hard he works. This is amazing. There is one question from HAL jam der strange the handle that says are you concerned the Bitcoin price could rip before getting access to more capital from an LSE listing?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:36:14) Yeah, that's a great question. So I think what you need to do is you need to think about it differently. So, let's say you're an individual and you had £100,000 just in your bank account. Obviously that would be a bit silly anyway because you should have deployed it into but so you've got £100,000 in pounds. So what are you going to do with that? Well, so you can either deploy it all into Bitcoin or you can average it in to Bitcoin. You know, that's the two things that I would do there. Not financial advice of course. Now with a public company it's different because you almost want a higher and a stronger and a more topical Bitcoin price because it makes the availability of capital easier. So that's kind of the opposite that everyone thinks. Like a lot of people think well you know wouldn't it be great if Bitcoin crashed because then you could buy more of it. Well, yeah, you could buy more of it, but probably with less capital, so not really more of it.

And I personally believe that Bitcoin is going up forever. And yes, it's going to have the odd dip. But I don't want to see a massive long period of brutal price action because you'll scare a lot of people away from the sector, you know. Like obviously markets, that's the way they work, you know. You'll get good times and bad times and things, but yeah, no, it's the opposite of what you would think, but you know, a slowly increasing Bitcoin price is probably the ideal result. After that, Bitcoin ripping like up significantly, that's probably the next ideal result. And Bitcoin staying flat probably after that, Bitcoin going down after that. So yeah, it's the opposite to what you would think it is.

**The Bitcoin Libertarian:**
(0:38:21) Yes, I as so it's better to Bitcoin to go up slowly instead of going flat because I understand if Bitcoin go down the investors are not going to put money. Yeah. Then if bitcoin goes up probably so fast probably they put money but you cannot buy so much bitcoin with this money but if bitcoins goes I don't know what do you think is going to happen in this upcoming months of course no financial advice with Bitcoin?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:38:48) I think if you look back what's happened this year so far I think Bitcoin has been going up you know sort of you know dependent on what your view of slow is you know slow to medium let's say you know Bitcoin this year already has been a very respectable return. If it did that forever, that would be okay as far as I'm concerned. Now, what do I think will happen over the next few months? I think it's going to go up a lot more. But that's just my opinion. And I think that'll be fine for the company in terms of what we're doing with everything. You know, I can't control the price of Bitcoin. I can't control when we may be able to list on the LSE. I can't control, you know, the I can try and influence the availability of capital, but I can't ultimately make those decisions because I'm not the capital allocators.

So I think we just keep stick to the mission, try and make sure that every aspect of the strategy is as good as it can be, and then ultimately we're building our business on the very best type of capital in the world. And does it really matter if it's a little bit more, a little bit less when we buy it? You know, you know, we'll look back at this, you know, in 5 years time, we'll all look back and we'll be a bit like, well, I can't believe that you could have bought Bitcoin for $150,000. You know, look at it like, you know, like people look back like what, two years, could have bought a load of Bitcoin for $50,000, you know, and people forget that, you know, two years, two years is nothing. Compare that to any other type of investment that you can have. The returns are unbelievable. So yeah, we'll just stick to the plan and I think we've got quite a good plan.

**The Bitcoin Libertarian:**
(0:40:47) Yes, I think that in a couple of years we will say what lucky we were when we were able to buy Bitcoin at $150,000 US. So that's what is going to happen. So let's move to the other question that the people of the group did. Proof of Power Overtime said could you can you ask him to go into detail regarding the announcements this morning specifically over the US raise and if he feels this aligns with his previous no discounts policy.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:41:28) Yeah sure. So that was the announcement yesterday morning the placing for just a little bit below 10 million pounds 8 million pounds of which was from one investor. So yeah I don't believe in any way at all that that goes against the policy that I've always said and I probably will always say of discounts over my dead body. Yeah, I think maybe there's a bit of a lack of understanding of different capital market tools like a warrant for example about what they actually are. So the warrants that we've issued to the investors that have put in the capital are effectively worthless until the share price is greater than 1 pound 50% higher than the price that we did the placing at.

So I think if you look at any other any type of capital market thing that you can do, you know, you can do debt, you can do equity, you can do warrants and options. So you can do convertibles, you can do all different things that have got different qualities to them. Different structures obviously. And I think it's a lot better to give that warrant away in exchange for them putting money in than it would be to say to reduce the price and then to do a discount. You know, I don't want to do a discount. So, that's why I've always said that I won't do that. But you do have to give people a reason to do something rather than them say well actually you know I'll do it in three months you know. Because my job is to generate that Bitcoin yield for our shareholders you see so I need to find ways of doing that the risk if you like of doing the warrants is that ultimately if Bitcoin increases by 50% from where it is now because of the exercise price of the warrant then that wouldn't be particularly smart in terms of generating bitcoin yield because you're not going to be able to take the capital deploy it into the asset of your choice and generate that positive Bitcoin yield with that. So that's the risk of doing that. But there's always a risk with whichever transaction you do.

And we've got some other ones sort of that we're thinking about doing, you know, different ones as well, different types of deals to, you know, generate the yield that we tried to do. But yeah, I don't agree at all that the warrants are some sort of a discount. Yeah, not at all.

**The Bitcoin Libertarian:**
(0:44:24) Excellent. And the last question that I have from the community is TDW says are any of the recent hires Bitcoiners or is orange pilling part of the Smarter Web employment training program?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:44:44) Yeah. So it's interesting really. So, if you take like our new non-executive director, for example, Randall, you almost want somebody that isn't a Bitcoin maxi because you want somebody that's going to challenge you, that's going to ask all the tough questions that you need to be asked. I think if you look at Albert, our CFO, clearly understands Bitcoin, is excited about the future. So that's one of the reasons he chose to join us rather than you know another company. I think it's quite difficult to find people that have got the particular some of the particular skills that we're after that understand Bitcoin and you know have done what say you or I do which is you know effectively lived our lives by Bitcoin for quite a long time now. So I think that's quite difficult to do. What's really good for me and really exciting is to see that everyone in the company without exception is a lot keener on Bitcoin than before they joined the company. I think that's pretty cool.

So I wouldn't ever mandate people that, you know, they've got to, you know, they've got to, you know, within three months they've got to have deployed 50% of their wealth into Bitcoin or anything. But without talking about any one person specifically, I think that you know people have said to me that you know how do I buy this and I've noticed that with other people that we've been working with in advisers that you know come in it as well. They start to ask more questions because they're more interested. So you know that's another thing that well is only a positive thing for Bitcoin. And to be fair for the individuals involved, it's a positive thing for them because they're starting to realize that fiat currency is an utter joke.

So, but no, it's not required. You know, I literally I just want the best people in the world for whatever job it is that we're trying to fill. And then we'll work with that person to you know without radicalizing them to get them to understand you know the benefits you know and I've still not met a person you know in almost 10 years of being interested in Bitcoin. I've still not met a person who's sort of had a decent amount of exposure to it who hasn't realized that it's got a tremendous place in this earth. So, I don't think we actually need to sell it. We just need to make sure that people are getting all of that information constantly, 24/7.

**The Bitcoin Libertarian:**
(0:47:24) Of course, that's what I do.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:47:26) I know. No, but it's really important. It's so important, you know, what people like you are doing and I think what people like us are doing, you know, we're obviously helping effectively the asset that we believe in, but we're helping other people to understand it. You know, in a non-pushy way, you know, I think that's really really beneficial.

**The Bitcoin Libertarian:**
(0:47:52) Well, sometimes I can be a little bit toxic, a toxic maximalist, but it is what it is.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:47:57) It is what it is. But sometimes but yes I think that we we cannot but I can imagine going to an interview and Smarter Web Company and say what do you think about Bitcoin just for a random job like and you need to understand Bitcoin to work there.

**The Bitcoin Libertarian:**
(0:48:11) Yeah, I think that of course working for a Bitcoin treasury company even though you are not interested in Bitcoin or you didn't know Bitcoin before it push you or at least make you question what is Bitcoin and go a little bit online to search about that and talking about the last incorporation Randall Carlsquist how will his expertise in governance and controls strengthen Smarter Web Bitcoin treasury strategy?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:48:47) Well, it will do it on multiple fronts. So when you're a public company, corporate governance is incredibly important as you become a bigger company. You're never going to get a big institutional investor write your check for 50 million pounds if you've got any issues on the corporate governance. It's just not going to happen, you know. So he will add a lot of credibility and expertise there. Not that we haven't got everything structured well, it's just it needs to be taken up that level, you know, you know, as you go to be a bigger and a bigger company. And then before he retired and he started to get into working at just one other non-executive director role, he was an audit partner at PWC. So you know he obviously is incredibly beneficial to work alongside you know our existing team you know including Albert and the auditors that we've got as well because they're external you know to make sure that all of that is done properly you know and you want people that ask the questions you know and then you tell them what it is and they in theory they should be happy with that you know and if not they keep drilling down to the thing.

So, it'll be tremendously important because when we first listed lots of people were understandably asking questions about how we custody our Bitcoin because we use a couple of the biggest custodians in the world because we don't believe that self-custodying Bitcoin is acceptable for a public company. And our auditors certainly share that same view. So you know and but the message or the takeaway from that time was that you know people want to know that Bitcoin is held in a responsible way and in a right way and you know you've got all those processes in place. So someone like that is so valuable for that side of things.

And the other thing that you get with a non-executive director which you know maybe not everyone's aware of is you know the great thing for me is to have lots of different people now that I can ask questions to if I'm unsure about anything or if I want another opinion from somebody that hasn't really got a bias. You know so having those experienced people that have you know been through certain things is really valuable you know when we're trying to get there because you know I've been very clear that I want us to be you know in time the biggest company in the UK before that one of the biggest companies and you know I can't do that by myself without having great people alongside me to do that so yeah really pleased that he wanted to join our company.

**The Bitcoin Libertarian:**
(0:51:41) Excellent. And to start closing the conversation, I want to ask what are the top priorities for Q4 2025 and of course for the rest of the future, the upcoming years for Smarter Web Company?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:51:58) Yeah. So, without wanting to answer it in a negative way, you know, I've been a little bit disappointed the last four to six weeks, in the speed of, moving things forward from a new capital point of view. So I'm hoping that a lot of the work that we've put into some of these new conversations and, you know, other things will really start to show the rewards of that. That's why I was so pleased yesterday morning to announce that one investor who put 8 million into the company. So you know you get 10 of those, you've got pretty much 100 million, you know, rough a little bit below 50% of what we've got. You know, it doesn't take a great imagination to see how that can assist us with our Bitcoin yield that we're obviously very focused on.

So yeah, I think that's the that's my main focus. After that it's just a wider marketing piece and making sure that we're getting out to more legacy media, more podcasts, you know, more conferences basically everywhere so that people can understand who the Smarter Web Company are, what we're trying to do and you know why Bitcoin is, you know, a great asset to build a corporate treasury on. So that's something else. And then you know I've been very clear about my aspirations of you know being one of the biggest companies in the UK and yeah we'll have to have to see when certain things allow me to talk about that more. So yeah that's probably a good place to leave it.

**The Bitcoin Libertarian:**
(0:53:41) Amazing. Amazing. Well, let's see. Let's see next year in August at Victoria Peak here in Hong Kong to see how many Bitcoin is Smarter Web Company holding. So, and talking about podcast, you are always welcome to talk here. Just drop me a message and we can talk and you can announce whatever whatever you want, whatever good news you have from the company. For me is a pleasure and I hope you can travel to that conference in Buenos Aires.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:54:18) I will certainly do my best because it sounds like a great event. I was really pleased when they invited me. We just need to make it work. That's one of the things that we're trying to do at the moment. And I think that it'll be a lot of fun for you and I to do one of our live interviews as well. So yeah, I would like to, you know, it is the oldest Bitcoin conference in the world. And I think it would be nice to, you know, fly the flag or to tell the story about the Smarter Web Company there, you know.

**The Bitcoin Libertarian:**
(0:54:54) Yes. I'm going to be there because I will be speaking at the La Bitcom, the oldest Bitcoin conference that is going to be held in Buenos Aires. And one of the things that I see is that it's very important to bring people from Bitcoin treasury companies to speak in the LATAM environment even though in English because we don't have we have zero information. We have zero information. We have I think that there are only three podcasts recorded with Bitcoin Treasury companies. All of that for Alexandre Lette because he speaks in English. Four podcasts talking about Bitcoin treasury companies. Three with Alexander Lyset and one with Ed Julene one of the organizers of the conference. So we need more and more people to talk about that in LATAM because nobody understands about that and we need to spread the word to force more companies there to adopt a treasury company and get benefits for that strategy. So it's going to be amazing if you can make it to Buenos Aires. I would say that it's not going to be so safe to go walking around recording with the camera, but but let's see what we can do.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:56:22) Yeah. I think the great thing about South America, if you think about it in terms of the size of a market, is it's absolutely massive. Whereas if you take China today as an example obviously you know with what's happened over the last couple of decades and the emerging middle class and the amount of money there is you know pretty off the charts you know obviously very unfriendly to Bitcoin because of the capital controls that they've got. But there's a real opportunity for the whole world if the wider South America can adopt Bitcoin even more than they've done so already. You know that could be a pretty incredible catalyst. And obviously away from just the economic side of things, something that would be very beneficial to all of those people as well, you know, because you know obviously you know yourself from growing up there that you know things like inflation are a real killer. So, so yeah, it's probably one of those parts of the world, South America, where, Bitcoin can do even more good than it's already started to do already. And then the world and Bitcoin can also benefit from, you know, all of those people as they benefit from it.

**The Bitcoin Libertarian:**
(0:57:45) Excellent. So, let's see if you can make it, we can meet in Buenos Aires and I will invite you to my favorite restaurant now in Buenos Aires.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:57:53) Amazing.

**The Bitcoin Libertarian:**
(0:57:53) So Andrew, thank you very much for your time. Anything else you want to add? And of course, how people can contact you.

So yeah, get in touch with anything and, you know, we'll just, you know, stick to the mission.
