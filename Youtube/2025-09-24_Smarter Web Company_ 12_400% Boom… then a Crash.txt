(0:00:00) Well, let's look at uh performance first. The Smart Web Company listed on the Aquis Stock Exchange in about April 2025. So, not that long ago from recording this podcast. The Aquis Stock Exchange is UK based exchange is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, but it's mainly for smaller kind of growth companies. A bit easier to list on there rather than, let's say, the main market. So, they listed in April 2025 for around 4p. Um, and by the end of May this year, it got to about a pound share price. Um, which was a 2,400% return. Pretty impressive. Um, in in just over a month.

(0:00:38) By mid June, it went up to two pound. Um, so double doubled its value. And then it peaked around the 20th of June at about £5 per share, which is a 12,400% return if you'd have got in right at the beginning. So pretty impressive. If anyone held or bought for at the start and then held till then then sold it at that point because then a few days later it crashed down to two pound which is then a 60% fall and now it's hovering at just over a pound. So it's it's essentially fallen 80% from its peak back in June.

(0:01:15) So it's been a pretty volatile ride um so far for the Smarter Web company, but of course it's early days. It's only just listed and it's been to buy and it's Bitcoin. So, it's gone it's gone from zero to about 2,500 bitcoins in about 5 months. Um, yeah, which is pretty impressive. Um, but when you look at any of these Bitcoin treasury companies, there's a couple of things you you need to understand.
