**Fostra:**
(0:00:00) Hello everyone, Fostra here. Hope you had a good weekend Monday. What's happening in SWC land? I will go through our usual daily share price update. We have uh it's 14th of July. We do a bit of share price. If you're new to this channel, make sure you subscribe. We do a share price analysis, an update. We check the MNAV. We are running a live financial model. We try and understand what's happening in the market. what's causing movement. Um, we do a little bit of X comments review and at towards the end some Q&A. Let's go. Right, the market's just closed. Let's take a look at the share price. You're we have coming off a a week of immense action and all expecting a massive start to the week. And where did we close today? showing me a bid price of £345, 11% down on uh on the last close price. What is going on? Fear not. Fear not. We will check the charts, check the models and try and make sense of this world.

(0:01:30) Okay, so that takes us across to the model where we then next do a small update. Look at that. the Bitcoin price $120,000. $120,000. Let's put that to the $120,000 that it is amazing. I just need to pause at that. But what you're thinking is what's happening with the SWC? Why isn't my share price booming? Don't you worry. Don't you worry. Let's Let's go. Right. Okay. So, I moved this across to check where the uh MNAV is currently sitting. You can see I've made a few more updates to the model. I've included columns for cash um as at the latest update sitting on 1,275 bitcoins. 31 million cash was there to be deployed. Um there was uh more Bitcoin purchases potential. By the calculations here, it appears that we could still get to one over 1,600 bitcoins with what's in the uh treasury. What is the uh MNAV trading at? The share price of about £345 gets you to approximately 5.8. So we can see everyone the the MNAB has come down partly. Is that to do with the Bitcoin price going up? Yes, I imagine so. You your net asset values increase because you're repricing everything. The 5.8 to me seems like a bargain. You can see it's the previous uh interjections the business has traded uh well above um 10 at points. I mean, this was right at the beginning of the process where it was got up to over 20. Um, where it's sat now, 5.8. Yeah, for me it looks like a bargain.

(0:03:30) Um, we move across. We move across. Let's see what's happening on the charts. We'll come back to this um net asset values here. I wanted to show you something as well. Um, look at that. 145 million net assets. Bitcoin price of around $120,000. Let's check the chart. What's the chart saying? I've got the uh the US chart here. Let's go to the US chart. Um normally we go to the UK one first. Let's do it this way around. Okay. So, the US chart and uh the US market is still live as of recording. Currently showing me a trading price of approximately yeah $4.77. Um you can see that's bouncing bouncing off this uh resistance um line support line uh the 0.7 which is about the $436 mark. So it wicked down there. Um but according to this chart on the US it's still trading around the the what they call the golden pocket level the 0.618 um bounced bounced below that. Um but let's see let's see where that lands. There is a small gap here. Unlikely, I would think. I mean, if it if it went down to fill this potential small gap around the What is that? Three $350. 3 between 350 and 380. That would be a bargain basement. I wouldn't imagine it to be sat down there for longer than a few seconds. It' be snapped up. Um so as you can see the the actually when you step back it it is all sort of trading around the 0.618 and the US is um contributing a significant amount of volume. You can see when the US market starts in the afternoon. Uh it does uh does drive a lot of the activity that we see.

(0:05:30) Um let's look at the UK chart. Why not? Wow. the UK see a few days pumping up up above the 0.5 uh support level and now it's smashed down slight it's across the 0.5 resistance level. Would it will it track back up? Of course it will. But let's see how it gets there. Um the resistance support level below that is the last book build at the 0.618 which coincides with the golden pocket for the UK business and that was 2.90. That was the any if it gets down there that's uh again barget basement. Um I can't see it. I can't see that happening. Um but anything can happen. No financial advice. All financial entertainment here always on the Vostra channel. Yeah. So hovering around the 0.5 I'd say summary wise. Don't forget there are 14 million shares being sold in the market only on up days. That's the 14 million there. um has there there may have been some pressure sell pressure to for that as well as soon as it rises above the I believe it was the 3 390 level if Friday closed at that. So any anytime it goes trades above that the business can sell a portion of its shares that it has out in the market that would apply some natural pressure. So I I do expect pressure, but hey, look at what my model is also showing me the next um as soon as those 14 million shares sh sell out. And if it hovers around the the MNAV at the moment, then you're looking at approximately 48 million, probably not far off of 50 million. And that would take it to above the 2,100 Bitcoin level. Wow. What would be the MNAV at that point? Who knows? But the floors are building. That's the important thing. The Bitcoin per share is rising and that's the that's the column we look at. Make sure that's what means it's diluting accreatively. You see the last point in action we had 661 bit sats per share. Um the next uh the next financial activity may well take it above the 800 mark. Who knows?

(0:08:00) Um right share price update MNAV. One other thing to show you with the Bitcoin price ballooning, guess what happens to net assets? They get repriced, right? Look at what my model is showing me on the net asset side. Obviously, the Bitcoin has purchases have been happening throughout the process. Um, if I was to revalue all the bitcoins, uh, this also smashes in the cash there, so it might not be 100% precise, but I'm getting a figure of about 145 million pounds of net assets. If you flick across and glance across to the um, capital raised column, you can see here from uh, line 14 above, there's 136 million pounds being raised. So £136 million versus the 145. What's the difference? It's the revaluation. So the business has made a gain of 10 million plus on the on its net assets. Where will that be flushing through? That's a that's a gain depending on the accounting rules that being followed. You know, that may well hit the P&L at some point. Anyway, I just wanted to show you that interesting. So, value is building in the business despite what short-term share price action does. This is the the whole game here is um is playing out as we are as we are seeing. This model is becoming quite a quite a model. Now, I've added a few more columns as you can see. I was scratching my head trying to understand what other bits I can add and just wanted to show you the total fund raise£136 million. One of the things I did was scratch my head and think okay how do I sort of look at this on a on a basic level in my basic brain business brain level um how much money is the company able to raise what's the run rate let's look at the number of days it's taking the business to raise that kind of capital so that's what the next column here is showing £1.8 8 million per day since the start, not including some of the holidays, just straight up. I then uh look at the purchase average price. Um I'm looking at potential figure here of around 23 bitcoins per day. So that's what I've done. I've calculated their run rate and I've added and I've said what's the average and what how are they evolving from the start. You can see when it all started they were purchasing about four bitcoins per day. um towards the end of the May getting up to about seven bitcoins per day. Um July here, July, June, sorry, 21 bitcoins. July is what we're in the middle of July, we're currently looking at around about 23 bitcoins per day. I would anticipate and hope that we could get to the 30 bitcoins per day mark with this uh trajectory. And that makes me want to think that the once the ATM is completed 50 million, could there be a book build, a book build will will make make this get to about 30 bitcoins per day? That would not surprise this model, but hey, anything can happen.

(0:11:30) Um, yeah, there you go. Excellent stuff. Flick back. Flick back. Share price. We've done MNAB. We've done X. Let's get across to the X. see what's going on on the S SWCX community. See, when there's a share price activity like it has been today, you can sense, you can sense the uh atmosphere. Andy Smith, WTF, there's no stopping CIUS. Cryus is on fire. Everyone like, share, and look at this YouTube video here. Cus has been on another podcast. That'll be interesting. Hector, nice low clothes to allow big ATM tomorrow. Could be. Yeah, Les Sher just putting my big boy pants on after today's price action. Yeah, keep them on the short-term price action. I know we look at this on a daily basis, but zoom out is what they say, right? Um yeah, look, this is the uh the sentiment at the moment. Take my money. Buyers stepping in at this. This is a good This is good value from from what I can tell from my financial model. Yeah. Trading around the the 5.8 MNAV. That's what that is showing.

(0:13:00) Let's uh flick across to some YouTube comments. Guys, you're showing so much love on this channel. I'm I'm blown away. Uh it makes me want to do more and more. I think we answered these ones at the bottom. Uh let's go to Steve, the dreamer of dreams. The price of BTC doubles overnight. the value of the shares you hold also doubles and the MNAV will be h haveved. If the MNAV was only 2x, then it would go down to 1x, which would actually be a good thing. It's not an issue when the MNAV is as high as S SWC's, but MSTR would have a problem at 1.6 MNAV, but in reality, the BTC price goes up relatively gradually. The massive pump since yesterday has only been roughly 8%. the share price will pump accordingly because the people investing understand it. FOMO in and the MNAV will go back up again. That was two days ago. I think that was before the recent pump. This is pumping every day. But you're right. Yeah, there is a a short-term impact on MNAV because the net assets value uh increased so dramatically that the market takes its time to repric is is the way I look at those things. Great comment. Good good analogy. Great stuff. Keep them coming. Paul Cotm, great insight as always. Good. Great. Thanks. Um, Tommy tank 2493 wick down to zero about 2:30 p.m. UK time. Can you add some explanation to this extreme fluctuation? That was 2 days ago. So, these are comments haven't got to from Friday. So, I don't I can't recall the wick down, but the you can see the stock is volatile. Goes up, goes down. Anything can happen. Doesn't take a lot to move this stock. you. It could be people positioning in, positioning out, getting ready for the next floor. You never know. I feel like Paul Narrow 982. I feel like you're trying to say something, but you just can't spit it out. What was that in relation to? Oh, that was that video there. Smarter Web hits 136 million fundraising. Do you know, Paul, when I created that one, that was pure off-the- cuff point, shoot, how do I react? And I was uh speechless. So that makes sense. I couldn't spit it out. I didn't have the words. Dave and Cow a 4512. Hopefully we'll go down and fill the gap around three. I think you did. Didn't we do that? You filled your gap. Hope you filled your bags. Andy Smith ASAP. Great work this week. This was in relation to last week's video. Yeah. Look, hopefully this uh the mic and the sound check, everything's coming through a little bit better. Might notice a difference. If not, let's we'll keep working on these production getting slicker. Yeah, look, you've got to evolve, right? The more you do things, the better you get. And great video, Vostradamus. That's a nickname that's coming up. Bro, send me the itinerary for the that Retesh Sutar 3923 says, "Bro, send me the itinerary for the Vostradamus Las Vegas party. I want to make sure I get my seat at the table." Hey, the things the way things are going, this Vostra party in in Vegas, that's uh that can happen. Less Sharma, excellent as always. Thanks, Les for your support. Manning 69, brilliant video again. Totally fascinating. And see you in Vegas. Yeah, I dropped that I think in one of those videos and you guys are picking up on all these little things now. Um, Devin Kapow4512, can you do a video explaining why the share price doesn't matter and all that matters is how much Bitcoin you get per share, please? I don't understand it. Yeah, we could probably break that down a bit more, but the the Bitcoin per share is the whole game. It's accreing um positively. Accretive dilution is what what it's called. If I quickly scroll across to my model and take you to the Bitcoin per share uh column, here you go. 6 uh 61 Satoshi Satoshi's per share was where where we left our last financial action. Um and you can see every single time that there's uh financing this Bitcoin per share is increasing. This is the most important thing people because uh everybody knows Bitcoin's going up forever, right? There's um Laura, Bitcoin's going up for error. And the model here, the way it works is as long as your MNAB is above one, you can positively dilute. And you want to dilute as much as possible. Get as much cash as possible. Get get cash buy Bitcoin. Get cash buy Bitcoin. Just keep doing that. Rinse and repeat. That's the game. Um, in terms of the share price, the market will do whatever it needs to do, but as soon as they realize and and people catch up, then that the the share price activity catches up. It's uh it's a funny game.

(0:18:00) If very quickly, let's look at some of the other uh share prices as well, just to cuz sometimes you guys think, okay, what's going on? Um, Coin, the one of the other treasuries uh took a smash in. Um, Meta Planet pretty flat. Uh MSTR, it's been MSTR's day today. You've got to pay homage to Michael Sailor. He's created the the playbook and it's time for some love there. AltBG pretty Yeah, just a slightly off. So, you know, there's movement happening. It's not um it's not completely one way, but it the share price will catch up. Has to catch up. That's the maths. Um, as long as the MNAVs can can be uh supported and sustained and then then it's all all good and and trajectory is is that they they are. So, excellent stuff. Brilliant. Let's finish the comments. I hope that helped. Hey, what what platform do you buy SWC stock on? Asks Michael Pena. Depends where you are. If you're sort of a broad US base where the um the other major shareholder group tends to hang out, then I think use something called Fidelity. Um, over in the UK, AJ Bell and Harrief Landown seem to be the the the places of choice, but there are lots of other places. Thanks for your question. Branching out a bit from MSTR. Sandeep Star says, "Branching out a bit from MSTR, new shareholder of the Smarter Web Company and new subscriber to this." Oh, very impressed. Thank you very much. Keep them coming. Keep your comments coming. 32nd like Midwest Cannabis. Keep liking. Keep subscribing. Keep doing all of that and uh we shall see you next time, next place. Ciao. Vosa signing out. Bye.
