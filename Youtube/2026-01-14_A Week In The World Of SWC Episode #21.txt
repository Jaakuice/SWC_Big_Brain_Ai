**James:**
(0:00:00) Andrew, happy new year. Um, it's good to see you. I know we're two weeks in, but I haven't spoken to you this year. Um, yeah. So, it's— you— the company's not even 9 months since IPO and I thought before we get into the latest January 2026 news, um, it would be a good idea to look back at what you've achieved in that not quite nine months um, and maybe your highlights from 2025.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:00:28) Yeah. So um we started in— on— well we IPO'd on April the 25th um of 2025 so nine months ago or something. Um we started the work you know 12 13 months ago dependent on you know how you look at it you know just before Christmas just after Christmas um you know so it's been a pretty intense period of time you know the the nine months that many people have been shareholders and for me the 12 or 13 months um you know once we actually decided to do this um and and loads of things have happened over the last year you know like I I haven't actually stopped to, you know, think to myself, what have the best bits been so far? Um, you know, clearly I'm very proud of the company as it's becoming. Um, I think that we've done quite well to build up a Bitcoin balance sheet of 2,664 Bitcoin. Um, I think that we've made massive strides forward in terms of building out our company, in terms of, you know, the structure, um, you know, the governance, which is really important. Um, you know, I think we've made good steps um in terms of the strategy. So that's not just the Bitcoin treasury strategy. That's the the you know, the operating business and the acquisition strategy. Um, so I think we've done well on that. I've I've I've met some amazing people. Um, you know, there's been been a few sort of downs as well as ups. Um you know as is natural with these things when when you've put yourself out there and your company's become you know quite high profile um you know there's— I've I've said in our weekly updates recently that you know like I view that first year or whatever the period of time is as like literally the foundations and then this is the the the bit that people will really see you know build the skyscraper on top of the foundations um and I think those foundations have been laid paid very very well. Um I'm not unhappy with any part of them. Um and it's going to allow our company to do what I want to do um for our shareholders. So you know it's— if last year was a good year um then I think this year you know we'll hopefully dwarf it. That's not a projection obviously. Um but then at the same time you know you know that's one take on it. The other take on it is, you know, I felt quite bad um for the last few months. It's been really hard and and that stems from two things. Uh one of those things is clearly the share price has been um you know, heading down. Um we we got to you know, approximately a 7 MNAV. Um and you know, at the same time, I've been very restricted on on what I'm allowed to say. So, you know, for me that— for someone that believes in transparency and trying to tell your shareholders everything that you can, it's, you know, that that's been quite quite um quite tough. Yeah. Um and I'm grateful for everyone that has believed that we're doing what we've constantly said we're doing, which is trying to build the company in the right way. Um and I'm hoping that, you know, that's the sort of the blip. Um you know as we then you know continue to advance from here obviously you know you know the only thing that I'm almost certain of is we're going to become one of the biggest companies um in the UK if we can continue to execute but I'm also certain that there will be a lot of volatility along the way um which we've always been very transparent about um but you know we we're we're working on lots of things that we'll be able to talk about over the coming sort of days weeks and months Um, and I was so pleased um to be able to announce um, you know, the the the news earlier this week, you know, because, you know, that that shows people that we're doing, you know, one of the things that we've said we'll do.

**James:**
(0:04:05) Fantastic. Um, I just want to ask though, sort of, you know, IPO April, May, June, that sort of time. Did you have any idea that it would go that well?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:04:15) Um that's a tricky question to to to answer because I had no doubt um that we would make the company um successful over the medium to long term. Um that was my opinion. Um and it still is my opinion. If you look back at the early articles about us, you know, I I 100% meant um you know, and I can't remember whether it's May or April, but there's an article out there that said we're going to be in the Footsie 100 one day, you know. Um you know, I believe that, you know, if we can keep working hard, we'll get in the Footsie 250 this year. Um you know, and then and then obviously as quickly as we can, we'll grow from there um responsibly at the same time. Um again, not a projection. Um, so I I I didn't have any sort of goal. I just knew that I wanted to be better every single day because that's how I've lived my life. Um, obviously not always managing to achieve that. Um, and and and and so I haven't really sort of tracked it in in the way that some people might. When you're in the thick of it, you know, you just you you're just working all day every day trying to advance and and as long as you're advancing, you're not really thinking about anything else. You know, I I had a moment the other day where, you know, because I remember when we listed Hark Land on the stock market, which was I don't know 20 years ago now. Um you you know, it was a pretty special moment. Um and you know when we decided that we would list on Aquis which has been a good market for us um you know it's a good growth market um you you know I at the time 9 10 11 months ago whenever you know I I I I didn't see the LSE as being something that that we could be on we we could be part of because you know the Bitcoin Treasury model um you know wasn't as understood as it is today. Um, so you know to go from um, you know, all being well and Aquis listing to an LSE listing in what, nine, 10 months or something, you know, that's pretty cool. Um, you know, so, you know, I don't really think of it like that if I'm honest. All I want to do is try my very best and I can't always do it because I can't control the market. Um, but all I really want to do is be better, you know, every single day if I can.

**James:**
(0:06:28) And you you mentioned there sort of LSE didn't seem maybe seem possible 12 months ago. Um would you see that as maybe one of your— one of yours and SWC's achievements that you've helped spread the word and and kind of um educate?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:06:45) Yeah. Yeah. And that's that's positive, right? Um, so, you know, I I I don't talk about lots of the other companies in the UK very often. Um, and that's because I'm so busy doing what I'm doing. You know, I speak to some of the people that run those companies privately. Um, if I see an announcement I think is particularly good, I send them a message saying well done and all that sort of stuff. Um, you know, I'm I'm just interested in the smarter web company. A side sort of benefit um for everyone including us um is that there is an acceptance— a growing acceptance. You know if I look back at the start you know you you invested right at the start so you probably remember that we were forced to describe our treasury strategy as a digital asset treasury policy I think that's was the words um and and and funnily enough that became the phrase DATs that people you know were using towards the the end of last year quite a lot. Um but fairly promptly we were allowed to change that to a Bitcoin treasury strategy policy. Um if you had been on those early calls with the advisers and you said that I would now be allowed to use phrases such as you know Bitcoin yield and you know MNAV and these sorts of things in an FCA um or being well-approved document um I would say that you're having a laugh. So you know clearly we've done a good thing you know um you know I I I think you know this is a continuous thing right you know like um over a period of time you know the good things prevail in the world you know not not not always as quickly as we would like um and you know Bitcoin and you know a company holding their assets in Bitcoin is clearly a good thing in my opinion um and and and so the acceptance is is way better than it was, you know, a year ago and um and I think in a year's time it'll be way better as well. So, you know, I'd like to think that we've paid— played a a small part in that. Um you know, there's lots of other people that are doing lots of things as well. Um which is great. Um and you know, together we're all stronger. Um, so yeah, I I— it's not really my style to try and say that, you know, we've sort of been one of the more important companies in the space, but we probably have, you know.

**James:**
(0:09:00) Yeah. So, let's let's move on to now then. Um, 2026, it's been an amazing two weeks for the share price with with with regards uh, you know, going back up. Um, plenty of news. Um, can we start with talking about your hiring of Martin Thomas? Um, as a new non-executive director. Tell us a bit more about him.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:09:22) Yeah. So, probably the best way of answering the question is just explaining the board composition of a um public company and the way that it's meant to work as far as I'm concerned anyway. Um so so a board of directors consists of executive directors and non-executive directors. Executive directors are people who in our case it's their full-time and only job. Um and in other companies it's it's you know the people that are running the company. So you know I view an executive director as you know literally that's their job. They do that all day long and and and it's as simple as that which which is basically what it should be but it's not always what it should be. Now their job is like mine, you know, the CEO um or Alberta, our CFO. Um and then they're supported by the wider team, you know, um you know, consultants, employees, advisers, all this sort of stuff. Um and then you've got the non-executive board. And the non-executive board is um typically people that um oversee um the the the executive board um and they meet periodically um you know to to ensure that the shareholders are being looked after— like obviously I view that as one of the most important part of my jobs but the executive— the non-executive board hold the executive board to account effectively. Um, so we've got um a non-executive board um that we've had since we we we we admitted um you know, nine months ago. Um Sean is the chairman. Um and then you've got Tyler. Um and then you've got um uh Randall who we announced uh you know earlier last year and then now you've got Martin. So what I need from the non-executive board is I need people with various different bits of experience to help me alongside what they're meant to do, which is, you know, oversee, you know, all the different things that the company's doing. Um, so what I want from that is is I want to have people with skills in different areas. Um, so Randall is, you know, he he he used to be an audit partner. Uh you know and he's the senior non-executive director for Games Workshop so you know audit and accounts related things all that sort of stuff you know amazing um and um and then Martin um he's very experienced in capital markets um he um there's probably not anything that you could know about um the legal side of capital markets that he he he wouldn't be able to talk to you about um and he's also got experience of a very very very small company like the size we were once um growing to like Footsie 250 level and then you know working out its next step. In their case it was moving to the New York Stock Exchange and maintaining a secondary listing in in the UK. I'm not saying that that's our plan. Um but you know growth um legal growth capital markets all that stuff. Um I think maybe in the future um we could we we would look at another non-executive director. Probably the one that I would like is is is more sort of on the entrepreneurial that scale side of things which you know the other directors have also got. Um but um maybe someone like a a version of me 20 years down the line or something you know if we can find one of those that would be good. Um so so so the non-executives in very very simple terms they um they oversee the board ensure the highest standards of corporate governance and they're a bit like people that I can pick up the phone whenever I want and say look how would you deal with this you know what's the best thing to do here all that sort of stuff. So they're really important but they're not like the executive board who are working all day long every single day um on advancing the the business. They're the people that are checking that the executive board are advancing the the the agreed strategy and and then significant things um that you might want to do um would would would go up to the board and you know they they'll they'll all vote on it basically and and then those things will you know sort of materialize from there.

**James:**
(0:13:08) Awesome. Um now on to the big news. Um you've announced your intention to uplist to the LSE. Um, can you— with it not being set in stone, I'm sure there's bits that you can't talk about, but with what you can talk about, are you able to fill us in maybe on the process so far or the process going forward, what needs to happen um before that happens?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:13:32) Yeah, sure. So, um you know, obviously everything related to that has been announced. Um so, if I just talk around that um that's probably the best thing to do. Um you know and you know people can refer back to the announcement that we made um you know to to clarify you know the the the the factual points. Um so the way that it works is um you decide that you want to list on the London Stock Exchange. Um we started that process um quite a long time ago. Um, people might be surprised to hear that, you know, that's that's taken more than a couple of months. Um, and and and it's it's a bit like an Aquis admission process multiplied by 10 or something like that, you know, not in cost. Um, but in terms of the work that goes into it, you know, it's a it's an incredibly serious— rightly so— process. Um, if you look back at last year, um, 2025, there weren't that many companies that that that did that process because it's, you know, it takes a a lot of time and a a bit of money. The the cost of it, by the way, will be communicated further down the line in the prospectus when when that's published. So, you decide you want to do it. It takes an amount of time. Um at some point you with the support of your advisers can decide when you tell the market that. So you know a lot of companies would have probably announced that a few months ago but we didn't want to do that because you know we we wanted to make sure that we were sufficiently confident of what we were doing before we said that. So that's why we announced it very very recently. Um and and if you look at that announcement, it was, you know, quite black and white, you know, very factual. It didn't have one of my quotes in it, for example. Um and then what happens after that is you publish a prospectus. Um and and that's um you know it's a document that you know when when it gets published— if if um if that's the right terminology. Um it's a document that that I'm really proud of that that that explains everything that we're doing. Um you know all the detail that you would expect you know um you know really well. I'm really proud of that document. Um and then um and then obviously you you you agree a um a point you know which according to the um the the other days of February. So that's the the point at which um you know you stop on one start on the other. Um you know it's basically um one stops one starts. It's not like there's an overlap or a gap. Um the those dates can change of course and they'll all be detailed in the prospectus. Um but that's what was in the announcement. Um and then that's when you start— um your shares start trading. So if you're a shareholder like me and you've got your shares in HL for example um you know it's it's sort of in— you're indifferent because the shares— well I believe you're indifferent because it's the same shares. They just trade on a different venue. Um and and and and that's that— you know on on the actual day of the um the event there's you know there's a— they call it an opening ceremony um which basically means that the company and its advisers um and in our case um providing I'm allowed to do it which which I haven't fully checked this one yet. I'm going to like do some sort of raffle so I can ask all of our shareholders to say who would like to come and then randomly select the spaces that I'm allowed to do because I thought that was the fairest way of doing it. Um you know because I want our shareholders to be part of that you know as much as the team and the advisers and the media and things. Um and and and that's you know um when the shares start trading and then um and then you just carry on doing what your prospectus says that you do which is basically very similar to what our admission documents said we would do when we listed on Aquis and what all of our announcements have said we would do and you know our ten-year plan which was very clearly stated at the start. Um so that's the process. It's it's you know it's it's it's pretty full-on. Um you know um and and I'm grateful to all of our advisers and all of the team because they've all worked very very hard on that. Um yeah so um that's the process.

**James:**
(0:17:55) Okay. Excellent. Um and it feels like we're you know approaching the final straight maybe if you want want to use that analogy. According to the publicly available information, it would appear that um you know it's imminent.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:18:10) Fantastic.

**James:**
(0:18:12) Um speaking of the 10-year plan, um are you able to give us a bit of an update on the operating business?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:18:20) Yeah, so um so I can't talk about any specific numbers or projections. Um you know I think a lot of my time last year was very much focused on you know trying to make sure that we had the right um composition of the team um and getting that heading in the right direction. I think the operating business which is um sort of largely sits underneath Alex um who many of you will know you can see him on our website um you know has has been doing exactly what it says it it will do. Um I um I I've got an ambition um of um you know and I've said this before on the on the in on the on the interviews when I've I've done them before that I was really proud um you know of the the fact that the smarter web company as a private company was profitable every single year for 15 years and clearly you know we've got bigger costs now and and I'm keen to get back to that position. Um, it's a tough market out there. You know, the the the the UK economy, which most of our business comes from the UK. Um, but you know, I'm I'm not disappointed with how it's going, but I can't tell you whether it's it's going better, worse, all the same. Um, what I can tell you is that, you know, in line with our 10-year plan, I'm I'm very confident that it's going in the right direction. Um, and I'm looking forward to be able to announce more information on that in due course. Um, and um, and and that's probably all that I should should say on that, you know. Um, although there's one thing that I would perhaps like to say, which is, you know, please could everyone remember that if they do work at a business or they own their own business and they do need a website, please get in touch with us because it's a genuinely great service. Um and um and yeah, but I won't try and you know do the sales pitch more so than that.

**James:**
(0:20:10) Excellent. Um so it would seem over the last sort of six months or so there's been perhaps a rotation of retail shareholders. Um and you've previously mentioned about investor meetings and things like that. What what's the sort of latest that you can share on your thoughts and and what's going on behind the scenes?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:20:30) Yeah. So, um there there's lots of different variables here. So, if if you look at, you know, your shareholders or who you want to be your shareholders, you can broadly speak— it up, split it up into retail and institutions. Institutions can be quite small or very, very big. Um you know, we've got a great dialogue with both of those groups of people. Um there are a lot of institutions out there um that will not invest in an Aquis stock um because they're not allowed to um you know and and and that's been a key consideration of where we're going. Um you know I've noticed um that my phone's got even busier this year um and and so I I firmly believe that sentiment is coming back to this type of company. Um I believe that um a company that's building its balance sheet on digital capital will will go through like waves. Um you know the the the best one that that people can study um for what the wave might look like but in my opinion not the time periods on the wave is Strategy. So if you look at Strategy there was you know a year year and a half whatever it was when it traded at a negative. I believe that all those times are really being squeezed up. Um so they they— if you look at their wave um they traded at a a positive MNAV and then came back to a negative um and then went up and then in this current um down thing dependent on where you look for their MNAV you know they either just dipped below one or stayed above one. Um and you know I think that's because the market trusts them because they've been around obviously they're bigger um and and and things like that. So I think that as we look forward, you know, 10, 20 years, whatever, um I think that you'll see these waves and the waves will be partly driven by sentiment and then partly driven by trust. Um you know, and and and that sort of stuff. Um in terms of where we're going in the very very short term with investors, you know, I've had emails from people— they've bought meaningful amounts. Um, you know, I'm looking forward to, um, starting meetings with investors in the not too distant future. Um, institutional investors, you know, the ones that that couldn't invest that said they would invest, you know, and and you never know whether, you know, that's really going to be the case, you know. Um, what we need, I think, is we need sentiment to come back. I think it's it's pretty clear that sentiment is so far coming back into a company like ours. Um you know, Bitcoin being our um you know, store of capital, we could do with that one, you know, heading back up and and in my opinion, that's looking pretty good actually. Um and um so in terms of the sort of the things I can't control, I'm pretty happy with that side of things. Um you know until we're admitted all being well onto the the main market um you know we can't do any specific um placings you know um so you know I would hope that you know we'll be back at the good old days in the not too distant future of you know lots and lots of these things um but you know obviously once the publication of the prospectus takes place the shares in issue is is is as it is and we won't be looking to do a supplement prospectus in that very very short time window which would be required should you want to do an additional fund raise using newly issued shares. Um so but you know there's the the— these these decisions that these institutional investors make they don't happen in in always in hours you know these are days weeks and months these decisions. So, I'm pretty happy with how everything's looking on that side of things. And, you know, without wanting to ask again for our shareholders to sort of um trust me on it, you know, I think that's what they do need to do. And, you know, if if I believe that I'm getting everything in the right place, then you know, you know, please believe that, you know, I'm trying my best on that one. Um, and I'm, you know, pretty optimistic about it. Um whilst not making any guarantees.

**James:**
(0:24:15) Sure. Um where does that leave the ATM between now and potential uplisting?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:24:22) So um on the ATM side of things, I would refer back to our previous announcements um because there's nothing further to those announcements that I would be able to say at this point in time. The most recent announcement was on the 24th of December when we announced that we had added some more shares to the facility. Um and we said in that announcement that we will update the market I think we said every Monday. Yeah. Providing shares have been sold in the preceding week. Um my instruction to the ATM operator has always been the same which is you know um I want to try and get the balance between um you know sort of getting capital into the company and letting the share price do its thing. Um you know and I think that's fair um and and and I you know I know there's been a bit of stick over that um facility with with other companies which which I think is grossly unfair if you look at the two biggest companies that have done the strategy i.e. Strategy in MetaPlanet, you know, you you you take their ATM proceeds out of the mix and you see how much capital they would have and and it would it would be significantly less. Um, so I um yeah, I like the facility providing it's used for the benefit of the shareholders over the medium and long term, but yeah, I wouldn't want to make any further comment on that facility at this stage.

**James:**
(0:25:45) Um, and I'm wondering if you saw the What Bitcoin Did episode with Michael Saylor, um, from a couple of days ago. Um, and particularly the bit about, um, Michael saying that they won't be launching prefs in the UK. How's that news standing with you?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:26:02) Yes. I I'll be honest um with you as I always am and as as I always am with everyone, you know, I haven't watched the whole video because I'm so busy at the moment and it sounds awful, but I've watched the two clips that relate to us. Um and I'm over the moon with both of them. Um, you know, it's it's humbling to hear somebody that's that's been so good for the space um talk about a number of other companies in the world and for for the company that you set up and then you listed and then you hopefully uplisted to be in that same um you know sort of minute or two is is is pretty humbling. Um so that's great. Um and then on the prefs side of things I think he's right to say that. I think that um if if anyone including Saylor um wanted to um you know explore a different geographical area I think everyone can do it— everyone. Um, but it's pretty hard. Um, so you need things like local expertise. Um, you know, um, you know, one of the great things about our company is Jesse and myself, we work so well together. Um, and we think very, very similar in lots of ways, but different enough so that we can help each other. Um, and I think that, um, you know, different— even the Americans and the UK people, you know, we think very differently in lots of ways. Um so I think there's a lot of nuances that um make it quite difficult for a company that isn't you know in a particular region to work in that region but um you know personally like whilst I don't want to go against the good news and and what he said you know I wouldn't have a problem with it at all you know the more the merrier in any space um you know as long as they're doing it well um and you know probably make our life a little bit easier actually which contrary to what everyone thinks. Um, but yeah, you know, it's, you know, I I I I liked hearing both of those clips and and and when I've got some time, I'm looking forward to watching the whole interview.

**James:**
(0:28:02) I know you're a bit pushed for time, but I've got two more questions left if that's okay. Um the first is um are there any sort of upcoming events whether they're community or commercial based um that you can let us know that you'll be seen at or or indeed podcasts or anything that you're hopefully going to be on in the near future?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:28:22) Yes. Yes. And yes. Um so um we'll announce the AGM in due course. That'll be at the Concord Museum again. Um I believe from a legal point of view it's got to be in March. So the the date will be communicated in due course and it'd be great to have um you know shareholders attend. Um I also mentioned earlier that on the day of um potential admission to the LSE we're going to do um— we're going to invite some shareholders. So you know there'll be some sort of a raffle around that. Um I would hope that fairly soon we'll be able to you know do that. Um also on that day um we're thinking of organizing you know some sort of— I don't know like a drinks um you know evening so that those of those that can't come to what might be a small number of tickets um for the the LSE event which will be done fairly randomly um— will— everyone will be able to come and you know I don't know within reason I'll buy everyone a drink you know um you know um so so that will be be be quite good. Um there's also other things though that that other people organized. Um so before Christmas there was um you know 80 organized a meet up in Bristol which was great. Um I think there's a London-based group of investors that um maybe we can sort of coincide with with our you know evening in London. Um and that's quite good. Um Henry who who's a great guy, the Bitcoin Chef, um he's organized another feast. That was amazing. You know, he did two last year and and that was really cool. Um I don't know whether there's still some tickets for that or not. Um but you know, that's another thing. Um you know, and and and there might be one or two more things um that will be communicated in due course as well. So yeah, you know, like the community is is fantastic. You know, like when when when things are tough or when you've had just an insanely busy day and then you flick onto the community and and you see how upbeat everyone is, you know, it it pushes you to, you know, work even harder. Um and and we're so lucky to have that support. Um, and you know, I'm determined that we're going to keep trying to build to to to reward those people for supporting us and and taking the time to get behind, you know, the smarter web company.

**James:**
(0:30:45) Speaking of which, final question. Um, what are your primary focuses for this year?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:30:52) Uh, to keep improving. Um, yeah, as quickly as possible. Okay. Um so you know I wouldn't want to— and probably not allowed um to talk around that in any more detail. Um the prospectus um will clearly outline um you know what the business does etc. Um and you know my job is to execute on that strategy. Now obviously over time that strategy can evolve um which would you know go through a proper governance procedure be communicated with shareholders maybe shareholders have to vote if it was specific things and you know all those things but you know it— as far as I'm concerned right now we're just going to keep doing um everything that we've been trying to do um and if I'm able to do it um speed it up and do it um you know better than we've done previously. You know, I can't make any guarantees that that will be possible, of course, but you know, I I will be very very disappointed if if I can't have a a better year um for our shareholders this year than we than we had last year.

**James:**
(0:31:52) Fantastic. Well, thank you very much for your time. Um it's been a great start to the year so far and I'm looking forward to the next 50 weeks um to see where where we end the year on. Um, and I very much look look forward to seeing you at the at Henry's Meal in in April. Thanks again to everyone in the community. Um, you all— you've all been fantastic. Just a quick reminder that um you need to get your votes in for the GM that's on the 28th. So, if you haven't already, please please vote um because that's pretty important. Um, and yeah, I I look forward to speaking to you or Jesse or or or indeed someone else uh in the future.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:32:32) Yeah, if I could just say one more thing before I leave you in peace. And, you know, that's just to say thank you to, you know, in no particular order, you know, all of our advisers, you know, the whole team at the Smarter Web Company. They've worked so hard to get us to this position where we're at um right now. Um, and then also most importantly, um, you know, all of our shareholders, you know, to have the support and the trust of so many different people, um, is is what makes the Smarter Web Company what it is today. Um, and, you know, we're doing our very very best, um, to keep executing the strategy, um, not just me, the whole team and the advisers around what I think everyone wants. So, um, yeah, I just want to say thank you to, you know, everyone internally and externally. Um, you know, oh, and there's the the the digital, uh, treasuries conference. Yeah, there'll be a lot of live things next week. Okay. There'll be a lot. Um, you know, there's only this one that I'm doing this week, uh, with you, James, because you're my favorite, but don't tell everyone else that. But um my other favorites will be all um all spoken to next week all being well. So I I think like what Jesse and I have said is we'll split it between the two of us. So you know I know that I've got a couple of things in the diary and he's got some great things planned as well. So, um, you know, we'll we'll we'll do our very best to speak to as many people as we can next week. And, uh, Wednesday evening, Wednesday the 21st, obviously, um, that's Tim's event. Um, and, um, I saw yesterday on on X that he had said that I would be part of that event and, you know, I'm looking forward to that. Tim is one of the first people, um, who interviewed me maybe end of April, part of May. I don't even know how we ended up speaking to each other if I was if I'm honest about it. Um, but Tim's Tim's been great. We've done a number of other things and he organized an event in New York in September that was absolutely fantastic. Um, and maybe one day an event like that will come to the UK. That would be amazing.

**James:**
(0:34:35) Well, I look forward to all the content next week. It's going to be it's going to be a good time. Thanks again, Andrew.
