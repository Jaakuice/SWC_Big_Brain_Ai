**Wra/Vostra:**
(0:00:00) Hello everybody. How are you? Vostra here. Been a couple of days since a share analysis update, a model update, and a lot of things have happened. So, let's get straight into it. 23rd of July. What is happening? What is going on? Let's check the share price close today for the Smarter Web Company plc. If you've not registered or subscribed, I should say, make sure you subscribe and like and um we'll continue with the updates. So, the Smarter Web Company on the 23rd of July has just closed a few minutes ago. A volatile share price action day. Um trading negatively most of the day. Let me just refresh this screen. It has closed at a bid price of 220. Uh just over 3% down on uh the share price from yesterday's closing share price. What is going on? What is going on indeed?

(0:01:00) Let's go across to our model, the SWC financial model that we maintain and let's understand where this is approximately trading at in terms of MNAV. So we take the bid price 220 and then we see where is that hovering approximately on our MNAV. So it's showing me an MNAV of about 3.4 I'd say. Yeah, just about just over 3.4 is the MNAV. If you recall last week, we had the on the 18th of July a book build of just over 17.5 million being raised at a book build of 2.95. That was just under an MNAV of um about five. So, we can see the MNAV is has come way down. uh currently trading at 3.4 today. The uh stock opened uh much lower and has been trading negatively pretty much all day.

(0:02:00) Let's go across to the share price chart. See if that can show you. Yeah, trade is the price is just coming in. But you can see from here it traded at one point at a low of 170. 1.70. That would have been a um an MNAV of of well well below let's have a quick look that would have been three yeah well below three at one point on the MNAV. So we can see that the the market um contraction is has continued this morning. However, this afternoon there has been a bit of a turnaround. We can see that the US um stock is still trading and it looks like it's closed the gap here. Gap over at the $3.1 and and the $270. Let's see if that's going to continue this evening because the other three major MetaPlanet altBG uh MSTR is still um off its high but altg and M metanet have seem to have made a recovery as well. So I wonder if this is the start of our push back towards the well on the US chart you would say the 0 0.786 which would take it up to the um 37 level there on the S SWC UK chart. You can see that there was a tremendous amount of support coming in at the 2 level earlier today. It didn't want to. It broke through briefly up to the 170, but it's uh made a nice recovery back up to uh 2 230 there, 225 230 just as we close today. The book build that happened last week at 295 just above the uh 0.618 level. Are we going to get back to the 0.618 level in short term? We shall see over the next uh I guess couple of days. But you can see that the uh the volatility in action is uh it's quite interesting how that evolves during the day.

(0:04:00) Um so the US is still continuing. You can see $3.15 8% over 8% up on the prior trading day. See if that continues throughout the evening. What else did I want to show you? Oh yeah. So the 17.5 million raised takes total raised amount on the SWC bitcoin treasury play to 153 million. Amazing. Absolutely amazing. Over 1,800 bitcoins. It's currently at 1,600 with uh 21 million pounds of cash. But if all of that was deployed, it would take it up to 1,800 in in bitcoins. We have an ATM running in the background that can only be sold on up days. If that sort of gets sold around about these price levels by the end of the month, that looks like another 30 million. together with the previous raises, you would be looking at about £81 million for July, which would compare with 878 million in in June total raise. Let's see, would there be another potential raise, another strategic placement? Who knows? I would like it to get to the similar levels as uh last month, but there has been a contraction in the MNAVs as you can see. So, are we now going to see this go back up to the fours and the fives and is the have we reached the low point? Remains to be seen.

(0:05:30) As you can see, the um yeah, the bitcoins are are building on the balance sheet. The ATM is working. The sats per share is increasing. So it's down to the MNAV now. Um the funny thing about the MNAVS is that these can be covered. The premium is covered. We've done a lot of work around premiums. So it's about the market understanding the uh premiums that it awards the companies. Has it how we going to see a turnaround? Let us um let us await the next couple of days. But we've updated the model. We know that we can still continue this game very very finely, very very convincingly. This is the not far off of 2,100 bitcoins with the ATM completing um a 3M nav is is still trading and tracking um at reasonable levels. You can see that as the MNAV expands the the share price will follow. But as long as the MNAV is above one and the the business is able to raise capital then the the model u works brilliantly and the sats per share will be um will keep increasing.

(0:07:00) Moving across to the Twitter review most recent post let's quickly check today shows the strength in SSWC and how patience will pay off. Yeah it was trading negatively all day and it's turned around towards the end. US is leading the charge now. Run it back turbo. Fire up the ATM, says Les Sharma. We are green. Jesse Meyers, I have more thoughts that I'll try to put into a post later, but in a nutshell, yeah, this is just exactly what we were seeing before. Has the uh MNAV contracted as far as it wants to go. Will it go below three again or are we going back up to the fives, the six, the sevens? ATM is running. ATM is running in the US. Let's quickly check the US. 8.6% 6% up $3.15. It's an up price. So, the ATM would be printing there. That's excellent. Um, did you manage to get the the dips today? Let's check.

(0:08:30) Okay, moving on. Next, uh, Twitter review Q&A. Lots of comments coming through. Thank you very much. It's been a few days since we've done these. Let's go. Midwest Canada's first like. Excellent. That was 5 days ago. That was for the MNAV 17th of July update. Jack Sparrow says, "Appreciate these updates." You're welcome, my friend. Sandeep Star was counting down the closed market as exciting as Phil Liot calling us print finish at the TDF. Well, not quite. Did you like that video by the way? This was on the um 17th of July last week when the book was getting built. That was a really interesting um analysis there. Take a look.

(0:09:30) Good auctioneer to says Brendan 80. I know I jumped on as the um the the price was turning suffer coddle your worst video by far watching the share price was annoying as hell. Bongo Sid9311 says you don't have to stay you blurt suffoc says bongo this pre his previous videos were good this one was annoying I'm sure he wants to grow this channel so will want feedback good or bad yeah feedback is excellent good or bad this is in relation to this so 17th of July I would urge you to check it out let me know what you think this is when the share price was trading negatively all day and all of a sudden in the last 20 minutes the uh the share share price turned around and the book uh effectively was built on that evening at the share price closing price of £2.95 I believe.

(0:10:30) Suffuk Huddle if you didn't maybe have another look at this this the whole point of that uh video was to actually capture when the the share price turned um at that particular point about 20 to 30 minutes from the end of play. And what you will notice and um which maybe didn't come across as well but we've recorded it. We've recorded the liquidity management I'd say in many ways because the share price as I said was trading negatively all day. And if we look back at the financial model and we can see that the book was built at 2.95. The commentary on that video, that share price video analysis was live as it was going through all the bid prices from the previous levels. What you could actually see from that and what I gathered was that Mr. Webbley or whoever's controlling the action there in the background was really trying hard to maintain the previous book build level um which was done at on the 26th of June at 2.90. So, if you review that live action there, which you said was the worst video by far, I would probably put it up as one of my top videos by far, sir, because what you have there is capturing a live situation of how the U book build was executed so perfectly when the share price was trading negatively towards the 290 on that day for most of the day. apart from the last 20 to 30 minutes when what happened was um clearly there was a book bill lined up minimum I can't if it was £15 million I believe and what happened was that the share price was not at the level of the previous book build so towards the last 20 minutes of trading it got to that 295 level which is 5 p off more than the previous book build in my opinion that would have been to protect the last book bill and it just shows you the ingenuity of Mr. Mr. Webby and wanting that to happen in that way to protect previous levels because you can always now say that the book builds have always happened at a higher price than the previous book builds. So that was very well protected. Um take a look at that video again if you didn't uh get the point of it. But um yeah, that's what the main uh main point with that was.

(0:13:00) Hey Steve, the dream of dreams. Six will say, "Hey, Wra, what is a book build?" Uh that the book build is essentially a way for equity funds to be raised um at the closing share price of the uh of the day. So imagine the the share price is now closed. um your broker and your advisers would then go and speak to institutional level investors who would want to be participating in a fund raise. Um so issuing shares, equity issuance and the uh broker there would be taking orders from people uh from institutions that would want to be participating in the fund raise. Um and effectively that is is the book build uh it's called called the book build I guess from legacy uh financial markets in that uh the uh broker takes the orders of interested participants and what the business will have done prior to that is make sure that there are institutional level investors lined up to in order to participate in that so that the business has confidence in that and there therefore That video there captured live that confidence because what was happening was that we saw in the background that there was a a book that was almost pre-built and that was um wanting to be finished in a way at a price point of 295 which is what the uh what the level was there. So I hope that helps.

(0:14:30) Um Dave TK most epic rant ever. That was uh yeah do you like the shorts? Trying to experiment a bit more with that. Daving TK says, "Vostra, please invite drunken FR for an interview. Drunken FR, this was the rant that you had. I was replaying it in the short. Please get in touch. People want to have an interview with you." Um, Devon, loving the content, posture. Please. Okay. Yes, we've captured that. Most epic comments ever. My thoughts exactly. Show me the Webly money. This is Yeah, when the price is tanking, you guys get emotional. step back s understand the business model and and you'll be fine.

(0:15:30) Andy Smith changing it up. Love it. Yeah, this was this was that particular video that we were doing the the share price closing live commentary on. Um trade for life 2023 40 million book bill. Let's go. Yeah, the book bill wasn't as large as uh we would probably wanted to have it and uh based on previous but again there was a method to the madness. Um maybe that these prices aren't as as lucrative to raise at. So you you cap the raises a bit more and wait for the MNAVs to rise again. Um and then accrete even more effectively. So that could be happening.

(0:16:00) Manning 69 says, "Great video. Like being at the races. Brilliant to see a positive day again. I'll have nothing to watch tomorrow." Yeah. Yeah. I had a couple of days off. See, it's funny how Manning seems to like that video and the other chap didn't. I'm an expert at timing my buys perfectly as the stock pulls back. Cheers for the vid subbed, says Grant Mail 4112. Nice one. Cheers. Drunken FR interview seems to be uh in um in demand. Scottish Mix says, "Great interview." Thanks. That was with Ragna. Oh, Ragna's interview was amazing, guys. Check that video out. Is uh Ragna is a is a major active player in the Bitcoin treasury world and uh if you haven't listened to that, it's definitely worth a listen.

(0:17:00) Jon and Mahoney says, "Excellent show, guys. Wish you all the best, Ragna. We'll try and get some more interviews like that lined up as well." Les Sharma says, "Excellent interview." Trading in psychedelics sound a good match. Yeah, have a listen to that. Sandeep Star says, "Very intelligent and interesting character. Glad to see that we share many of the same investments." Uh, Ragna publishes his playbook on X, so he he's regularly updating his portfolio. It's really worth a follow on that one. Ragna is absolutely fat. Fantastic. I've gained so much from this. Thank you. If possible, can we get an interview with Micro Strategist? Yeah, I'll try. Um, lots of alpha being shared on that Ragna video. Do take a look.

(0:18:00) J Jason Jace Apadin, amazing video. Subscribed. Thanks. Yep, that was the Ragna video. Drunken FR is back. Wash show. Show me the money. Drunken FR, how do we get in touch? People want an interview with you. Um, Midwest cannabis ninth like, "Cheers Midwest Bitcoin history class. Did you like that next Bank of England video?" That was a That was a great analogy there. Annie Smith, great work, mate. Great content. Cheers, Austria. What about proof of reserves? Why aren't we talking about this? We are no better than the Bank of England if there is no transparency. Yeah. What do you guys think about the proof of reserves debate? Why aren't we talking about this? I mean, this this has raised it its head a couple of times. The response from uh some of the treasury companies is around, hey guys, look, we're audited. We would go to jail if we got that part wrong. Um that said the whole ethos of transparency and the Bitcoin aspect is yeah there is a a point around looking at if there's better ways to be more transparent about reserves. Is there um legal issues involved though as well because you've got to uh not announce to the market pre uh prior to making everyone aware through um official announcements through RNS's as such. So if there was a uh kind of blockchainbased proof of reserve um dashboard I guess if for one of better words is that does that go against some of the legal requirements there might be some more to this than just uh what we can think but yeah look the these are public listed companies so they must maintain a level of um transparency corporate governance by their very nature of operating. So yeah, let's talk more about that. I'm sure there'll be more to come.

(0:20:00) Can't believe there are so few views on this says GRJ1. This was the Ragna. It is picking up the um uh the way this kind of works is it kind just it cooks for a bit and then it gets spread out. So last I checked this is Ragnar's video is probably one of the best performing videos on this um channel. Absham, hi Vasha, where can we download the origin story? Another great video content. Which origin story is that for the why the smarter web could be the next Bank of England? That's the That's the Vostra channel, mate. You've got it all here. This is you can download it all here. Make sure you're subscribed. Stay tuned. You get all of the origin stories from here.

(0:21:00) Seno Scar Handsome 8847 says, "Thanks. No problem, dude. That was awesome. Love the informative videos. In fact, I'm sending this to some people who are trying to understand BTCTTC as a good starting place. Thanks, John Mahoney. This was the uh P bid ratio breakdown that we did. Awesome. Yeah, put your comments if there's any areas that you want more explanations around. We'll try to get to all of them. Paul Cotm, great explanation. Easy to understand for the Tradfi numpties. A can you just imagine these guys trying to understand a Bitcoin treasury company? Sirio 5882. I'm a SWC newbie and the presentation is a very useful. I started with MSTR last year and only got into SWC after the slide from the initial peak late June 25. Subbed and notifications set. Great. Thanks very much. Yeah, keep watching, listening, learning. We're all uh we're all trying to make sense of this.

(0:22:30) I'm Laban 77. I'm down almost 50% in a couple of weeks. When is it going to turn around? Julian Venbables says same here. Bostonra please can you explain when you think the stock price will turn around actual dates as predictions lab 77 then says is it time to double down well I mean you've seen today itself has the stock turned around let's uh you know US is 322 as we speak 10% up this is a volatile stock have a higher time frames you understand where where you're entering into calculate your sats per share understand when you're going to um get back to your 1 mnav level and uh that will give you all peace of mind as to where where you need to get to.
