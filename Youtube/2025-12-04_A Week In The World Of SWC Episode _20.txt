## Key Topics:
- Bitcoin market outlook: mid-bull correction, not a major bear market top (no 20x blowoff)
- Four-year cycle thesis: October 6th was 510 days post-halving ($126K top) - self-fulfilling prophecy by whales
- Baby boomers via ETFs buying the dip while crypto natives panic sell/delever
- MNAV compression across treasury companies: SWC at ~0.9x vs Capital B at 1.6x outlier
- AGM motions passed: share buyback authority now granted (key for sub-1x MNAV Bitcoin yield)
- Bitcoin yield mechanics: reducing share count when can't issue equity above 1x MNAV
- LSE uplisting benefits: FTSE 250 inclusion = £30-50M inflows, institutional access, more brokers
- Leverage strategy: very small amount, only when criteria met, prioritizing balance sheet health
- Preferred equities as "chapter break" in Bitcoin history - enabling fixed income market capture
- Long-term vision: Bitcoin treasury companies evolve to Bitcoin lending when monetization completes

**James:**
(0:00:01) [Music] Jesse, great to see you again.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:00:05) Good to see you, James. I think it's two months since we last spoke, give or take.

**James:**
(0:00:10) Oh, wow. Time flies. And I think it's a month since I've done one of these, so hopefully I can remember how to do it. So I want to start first of all looking at sort of Bitcoin rather than treasuries. And talk a little bit about that. Where do you think we're kind of at with Bitcoin at the moment? What's your broader outlook? That kind of thing.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:00:38) Yeah, you know, it's tough to say. You know, yeah, I have a lot to say, I guess. And I don't really know, but I lean towards bullish Bitcoin. I lean towards what we've gone through recently is just a mid-bull market correction with a little bit more spice to it because of the context. So I think you know for the last 15 years the concept of a four-year cycle has grown stronger over time. I've been an advocate of it. Until this cycle, until how this has played out the last few months, I've been a believer that the every four years halving drives a bull market that then precipitates a bull market top 12 to 18 months later is what I've always said. And if you go back and you do the math on how it has played out over the last three halvings, I think the average is like 510 days post-halving. There's the top.

And what we had is October 6th came around and that was 510 days post-halving and that was $126,000 per Bitcoin and that was the top. And I think what has happened is lots of early holders, lots of whales know that playbook, know that game, have bought into that view of how to play the Bitcoin cycles and started selling and created the top. So I think it was self-fulfilling there. Then the question becomes, you know, is that actually the bull market top or have they created a local top? And I lean towards the latter. I think we haven't had enough of a bull market to precipitate a major bear market. You know, in the past, you had a bull market where you were up 20x or more. And when you have that kind of blowoff top, it precipitates, you know, a major bear market, people getting caught off sides in terms of leverage and there's a ton of pain ahead. Somewhat analogous to what Bitcoin treasury companies have gone through with the first cycle for many of those companies including us.

So anyway, I think that there hasn't been a bull market that justifies a major bear market. If you look at it in gold terms, if you look at Bitcoin in gold terms, we haven't broken out from the 2021 high of Bitcoin priced in gold. And my view is that what we've gone through recently here is then early holders playing that four-year cycle top game precipitating more pain than would have otherwise been felt at a correction. You know if you go back to 2017 or 2021 but it's a lot cleaner in 2017 there were like 7 or 8 or something like that 30% drawdowns during the 2017 bull market which were quite short. Those happened and were eaten back up within a month in most cases I think probably in all cases. This one's going to take a little bit longer. I think everything just moves a little bit slower nowadays because we're in a more mature asset. Back in 2017 there weren't any derivatives and ways to short and ways that institutional Wall Street players were playing the market and now there's a lot of that. So things take more time.

Anyway, so that's overall my thoughts on what's happening with Bitcoin is I think that early Bitcoiners, OGs, the whales believe that this is the, you know, they're playing it as if this is the top, but we haven't had the setup that justifies a top. And instead, what we've seen, you know, and I was remaining bullish when we got down to $80,000 per coin. And I think now with this bounce, it's, I think more people are starting to say what I'm saying, which is institutions are happily eating up those coins that whales are selling because they're trying to play the game that they've known. But there's a new bigger fish in the market and that's, you know, institutional capital, mature TradFi capital. And a lot of it is baby boomers, I think, who are, there's a great chart of the IBIT Bitcoin ETF in the US that shows, I retweeted about a week ago. It shows that during this dip from $126,000 down to $80,000 per coin, the total assets in IBIT hasn't really dipped that much which means that baby boomers who are the ones who disproportionately get exposure to Bitcoin through that product are buying the dip and seeing it as an opportunity to scale in more to Bitcoin. And I think that's in contrast with the crypto natives who are all in Bitcoin, many of them leveraged so more than 100% in Bitcoin, and then a dip happens and they become panic sellers, you know, and they have to delever.

So I think that's a perfect little microcosm of what's happening here is that the old guard is playing it as if it's, you know, here comes the 80% drawdown. Everybody's going to be trapped and underwater, forced sellers. It's going to be painful. And then the baby boomers who are, you know, have one, two, three, 5% exposure to Bitcoin through the ETF are adding a percent happily buying the dip. And I think that's how we end up, I lean towards this is how it ends up being a correction in hindsight, a local top and a local bottom rather than a major bear market top, a bull market top, and bear market to follow.

**James:**
(0:07:25) Yeah. And then, you know, over the last, well, since October 6th, there's been a hell of a lot of Bitcoin FUD, MSTR FUD, that's really, again, it's a different cohort of buyers now. You have Bitcoin treasury companies, you have, you know, ETF buyers, you've got sovereign wealth funds who are really all of these parties are buying coins on net from, you know, early holders who acquired their Bitcoin in the first four years of Bitcoin's existence and they're scaling out while TradFi is scaling in. And then what about the sort of bullish developments over the last I don't know week or 10 days you know Vanguard are opening up, Charles Schwab, not sure about the JP Morgan thing with the structured note but, well actually do you have an opinion on their structured note if you looked at it?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:08:18) I haven't actually looked at that product, so I don't really know. But yes, you're right. There has been, it's been a lot of Wall Street opening, greenlighting things or, you know, opening for business with certain products. You know Ben Workman had a good tweet about that the other day about it's quite coincidental timing that all of these macro and Wall Street forces are aligning with Bitcoin at a time when sort of manufactured fear has driven the price down quite a bit. So yeah, it's quite possible that that's what's going on. It's definitely interesting timing the complete flip, but there we go.

**James:**
(0:09:04) So now on to sort of Bitcoin treasuries. And starting kind of in general, everything's been compressed, right? It's been five months of pretty brutal downside. After a period of euphoria, so you know, it's not like there wasn't upside first. What's your kind of, I don't know how much you can kind of say on this but what's your kind of opinion if we just look at the good treasuries, obviously you've got MSTR and MetaPlanet are kind of a little bit further ahead but if you took say our nearest comparator, Capital B, their fully diluted MNAV is 1.6 or somewhere around there and ours is 0.9ish somewhere around there. You know they haven't got debt or leverage so they're not demanding or commanding a premium because of that. Why do you think there is this disparity?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:10:11) Yeah, that is the outlier and I don't really know. I think there's probably a variety of factors. I think a big one there is probably that their shareholder base formed earlier, you know, or at least in part. You know they've been doing this strategy for a year now, just probably just over a year. Whereas Smarter Web started seven months ago in a time, you know, right before Euphoria. And so I think that the distribution of shareholders is a little different because of that, like you know, there was probably more time for Capital B shares to get distributed and the sort of background psychology that existed when shareholders were acquiring Capital B shares in that first six months let's say was different. And so, I think, you know, if you got in early and you had like a level head about why you were buying and then you rode it up and then it's come back down, but you're still doing better than when your entry point, you're probably better able to weather it and not panic sell or be a forced seller.

And I think that's not the case with a lot of the Smarter Web shareholder base in general. I think, you know, I've talked to a number of larger investors and a pretty common theme that I've heard is that people are tax loss harvesting or in a few cases deleveraging, you know, and actually not because of their Smarter Web position, but because of their MetaPlanet position, you know, and then they had a little Smarter Web on the side, but now their MetaPlanet position is in trouble and they're underwater on their leverage if they have any and they're trying to find assets to sell to delever and they're selling the Smarter Web because you know they're worried about their bigger position in MetaPlanet. So that's like a theme that I've been hearing from folks especially as I've had to like field questions about how to tax loss harvest in certain circumstances.

So I think that kind of paints a picture of what's going on with the Smarter Web shareholder base is there's a lot of people who are selling at what I think is an irrational, you know, sub-1x MNAV point because of extraneous circumstances, because of their particular situations making it sensible for them to sell under 1x MNAV.

And the point of calling attention to that is that's inherently temporary. You know, like some people are underwater on leverage, some people are tax loss harvesting. Both of those things resolve themselves at some point. And you would, logically you would expect to have some return to valuing the shares at at least 1x MNAV, right? Why Capital B is still so much higher, I'm not really sure. I mentioned a couple reasons that might play into it. But yeah, you know, they are the outlier because the other quality Bitcoin treasury companies, you know, MetaPlanet, I don't know who else you want to include in that group. H100, the sort of pure play, you know, deliver Bitcoin yield Bitcoin treasury companies. Everybody's under 1x MNAV. Strategy is kind of right around 1x despite having such a tremendous track record and balance sheet and shored up position with the billions of dollars they've now set aside to pay dividends for I think two years. So, you know, they're in an incredible position and still trading pretty much at 1x MNAV.

I think overall my mental model of what has happened here is that the reality of a Bitcoin treasury company model is that as the MNAV goes up, the companies get better at delivering yield, right? The companies get better at executing on the strategy. And as the MNAV comes down the reverse is true. So it's reflexive, you know, from a strategy execution point of view it's reflexive, it's recursive too because you know it relies on those inputs for you to be able to execute on the strategy. And so I think it's kind of binary conditions of people are either bullish and probably too bullish or they're bearish and as the metrics deteriorate, you know, in terms of the capacity every month to deliver Bitcoin yield, people become overly pessimistic about will Bitcoin treasury companies ever be able to increase Bitcoin per share into the future. And so in my head, it's kind of like a sine wave that where sentiment swings from too bullish to zero enthusiasm, you know? So, it goes from very bullish to the zero line. And I think we're kind of at the zero line, right? Like if you're trading under 1x MNAV, that to me says there's zero enthusiasm. You know, collectively.

And a good part of that is that, you know, these forced sellers and that adds, that offsets the rational folks in my view who continue to have a long-term perspective and are bullish. And the net of that is collectively the market has zero enthusiasm, right? Or is overly pessimistic such that it trades under 1x MNAV.

So, but the important thing in there from my point of view is to evaluate what is reality, what's true. Is it that a Bitcoin treasury company model worked until now and now there's no enthusiasm and there will never be enthusiasm, or is it the kind of thing that oscillates in terms of sentiment because, you know, what is the value proposition of a Bitcoin treasury company? The whole point is to grow your Bitcoin ownership over time and using capital market tools to do so. There are things you can do under 1x MNAV which I'm looking forward to doing hopefully. There's things you can do at 1x MNAV and there's a lot more you can do when you're trading at 2, 3, 4, 5x MNAV. But in every condition there are things you can do to deliver Bitcoin yield if certain criteria are met and other, you know, certain processes are not going on simultaneously. So if a company is able to continue to deliver Bitcoin yield despite whatever MNAV they're trading at, then reason would eventually return you would think of investors starting to value that company based on the track record. Let's say you stay at 0.9 MNAV and you continue to deliver Bitcoin yield through using a couple different levers than you would if you're at 5x MNAV. Over time you do that for a year, people would have to start to say they're still executing. Why are they trading at a discount? They're growing Bitcoin ownership. And then you'd start to see the market I think price it back to north of 1x MNAV and then you get better at delivering Bitcoin yield because there's more things you can do and then it accelerates again and the reflexive thing happens in the positive direction yet again. And so I think that's my mental model is that Bitcoin treasury companies will continue to oscillate between overly optimistic and zero enthusiasm. And I think at the moment we're at the less fun part.

**James:**
(0:19:24) Yeah. Yeah, I mean it would be nice if it just kind of oscillated based on your performance, kind of, I don't know, company X is a 2x MNAV because they're delivering this yield. But the reality with Bitcoin and I think with Bitcoin treasury companies is that human psychology prevents something from trading at a nice steady, like, you know, if you're like 2x-ing Bitcoin and Bitcoin's I don't know 30% a year so you're growing at 60% a year, people are going to get way too excited about that, you know, and then that turns into, that creates the sort of cyclicality I think that is inherent to this model.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:20:00) Bitcoin is the best asset in the world. Bitcoin treasury companies in my view, a well-run Bitcoin treasury company is the best way to grow your Bitcoin ownership. And so, you know, people get too excited about that when they're bullish on Bitcoin. And I think that's a big part of why Bitcoin treasury companies have languished the last six months is that Bitcoin's down for the last 12 months. So, you know, there was a lot more enthusiasm for Bitcoin a year ago than there is right now. And Bitcoin has a way of doing that. But you know, my thesis hasn't changed at all on Bitcoin. Like, it will continue to go up in a stair-stepping fashion, you know with maybe some major bear markets along the way, but it's going to be the best performing asset over the next few decades. So, you know, I want more of it and I've continue to have that view. I think most Bitcoin treasury company punters never had that view or have certainly lost that view. And we have to, you know, digest that and those shares have to change hands to people who are getting in now with a level head and a positive outlook for the future. And that takes time.

**James:**
(0:21:15) Yeah. So, I just want to talk a little bit about the AGM. I know you weren't able to be there. There were two motions that were voted on. And I wondered if you could kind of talk us through those two motions and maybe some of their implications and what the point was.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:21:36) Yeah. I actually am only really familiar with one of the motions because that's the one I care about quite a bit. So we didn't have the authority to buy back shares. And one of the motions was to get the authority to, you know, buy back shares if management deems it's a good idea. And that is important to me and to what I want to do and it makes it possible. So, you know, a reminder to everyone that Bitcoin yield is increasing Bitcoin per share. That's the goal. That's my goal. It's what I want to see done. You know, Andrew is running a web design business with a Bitcoin Treasury policy. And I'm focused on the Bitcoin Treasury policy, and what I want to see is Bitcoin yield.

And you know, when you're trading under 1x MNAV, it's not possible to sell equity at a premium that amounts to, you know, delivering Bitcoin yield because you're increasing the number of Bitcoin that you hold more than you're increasing the number of shares, right? So that's what when you're above 1x MNAV you're increasing the numerator more than the denominator but you can't do that under 1x MNAV. But what you can do is reduce the number of shares and then that means that, you know, if even if you're keeping the numerator flat, the number of Bitcoin held flat, if you are reducing the number of shares outstanding, including fully diluted shares, then you are increasing the amount of Bitcoin held per share and that's Bitcoin yield. So I think that's the key to how you can deliver Bitcoin yield under 1x MNAV is having the capacity to opportunistically play with that denominator. And now we have the authority to do that which is great news.

And literally the other measure I don't even know how it was phrased, so you probably know better than me.

**James:**
(0:24:15) Yeah, I mean, I'll be completely honest. I read it and I ran it through Grok and it couldn't come up with much that was particularly sort of exciting. It seemed like the main one really was upping the max salaries and the ability to do the AGM online, broadcast online, not having to be in person.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:24:43) Yeah, administrative items that, you know, are important but less relevant to what I'm trying to achieve. So that's why I'm less familiar with them, frankly.

**James:**
(0:24:59) And then also at the AGM, I watched the presentation video yesterday.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:25:05) Me as well. I, that was the first thing I did yesterday was tune in for that.

**James:**
(0:25:10) There was one little bit that I posted on X as well. And Andrew sort of, he, it was just after he'd been talking about potential mergers and acquisitions and then he was talking about sort of a winner in each jurisdiction. And he sort of mentioned briefly about the potential for joint ventures or strategic partnerships. Hypothetically speaking, what might that look like? Cuz the only person who's likely to want to do a JV with anyone is MSTR, right?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:25:45) I saw your comment on that point. I don't know that MSTR would be interested in something like that. I don't think that that's what Andrew meant by that comment. I think he probably meant more about just the potential partners in the UK for any of our products, for the web design business, for, you know, if we were to roll out financial products into the future, you know, for the Bitcoin Treasury side of the business. You know, who would be a natural ally or partner to, you know, help us achieve that? I don't know. And I think that was the nature the extent of it. I don't, you know, he wasn't trying to drop any particular hints there.

**James:**
(0:26:44) Sure. No, I wasn't thinking it was like actually happening. I was just, it was more kind of hypothetically speaking.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:26:52) And yeah and I think hypothetically speaking we are open to seeing who would make sense to partner with on various topics. So you know, that's something that time and the development of this market will bring opportunities for us to continue to strategically maneuver.

**James:**
(0:27:19) True. I don't want to ask directly about it because I know you won't be able to say anything, but I was wondering if you could maybe remind everyone what the potential benefits of SWC one day uplisting to the LSE.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:27:36) Yeah. Well, you know, we've been quite public that it is our aspiration to be on FTSE 250 and then FTSE 100 and then we want to be one of the biggest companies in the FTSE 100 eventually. You have to be on the LSE to be eligible to be in those indices. You know if you're on LSE you're accessible to a lot more global capital. We talked to quite a few institutions who it's not part of their mandate to touch anything on Aquis. You know I think people kind of forget just how small Aquis is. I'd certainly never heard of it a year ago. And the trading volume on it is not that high. I, you know, if somebody, I think it might have been Toffee, ran the analysis that since Smarter Web's IPO we've been like 60% of all the trading volume on Aquis alone. Which is quite high.

So most institutions, a lot of institutions I shouldn't say most but it's possible it's most, institutions simply can't invest in an Aquis company but they certainly could for an LSE listed company. In addition to that, you know, on the institutional side, also to some extent on the retail side, I think you know who knows how many pensions or how many folks in the UK don't know how to or aren't willing to invest in or look into companies that are on Aquis.

And then there's a few other things in addition to those just accessibility points. If you do end up on the FTSE 250, I ran a quick analysis of that and it would amount to 30 to 50 million pounds of inflows from, you know, upon inclusion, spread out over a bit of time. And that's for being the smallest company on the FTSE 250, which I think is, as of about a month ago, is 420 million pounds. And we're half of that at the moment, I guess, a bit less. And then every £100 million of market cap you gain would amount to 12 million pounds of additional inflows at the quarterly rebalances that happen. So, that would be quite a nice tailwind. And yeah, those together are some pretty big potential catalysts on the horizon.

**James:**
(0:30:52) Yeah. And John Thor has piped up. Does it bring access to more brokers? I think it does.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:31:04) Yeah, you know, I'm less familiar with exactly who, you know, in the UK landscape is not enabling trading, but there are some. So Trading 212 is one of the ones I've heard for this point. So you know, yeah, so that would be the access on the retail side as well. And John and Andy have pointed out that it was Toffee that ran the analysis.

**James:**
(0:31:28) Okay. Thank you to Toffee. He's putting out some sneaky good analysis here and there.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:31:34) Yeah. And yeah, it's completely mind-blowing. I guess maybe not to be unexpected. Not to be, it is to be expected. But still kind of an amazing stat.

**James:**
(0:31:54) People have kind of been calling for SWC to take on leverage you know back when the share price was £3, when it was 2, when it was 1 and then again now. I guess what I want to ask is more about timing cuz I've got opinions on this which is you know £3, £2, £1 that was never going to do anything because the market was heading in one direction only and it wasn't individual to SWC. If it had been individual to SWC then maybe but is there kind of, you know, we're below 1 MNAV, is there a best time to do it, you have to consider other factors, you know do you need to know whether we've kind of bottomed, you know what's the kind of theory behind when's the best time to take leverage?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:32:49) Yeah. Other factors weighs heavily. You know so if and when we take on any leverage, yeah I'm a fan of a very small amount of leverage. I think, you know, and we'll continue to evaluate and explore the best way to do that. We have identified a good way to do that but there are other factors that make it so that now, right now, we are not able to for the very short term. And that's a good thing.

Your point also though about trying to time when to take on leverage is a tricky problem. It's not really how I think about it. It's sort of secondary to the thing that I hope to be able to do. You know, my focus is on Bitcoin yield and if the numbers there make sense and the criteria are met such that you can do something, then I'm a fan of those actions. But you're right that in a funny way like if we had taken on leverage at any point in the last four or five months it would have not helped. It would have actually probably exacerbated our sort of downtrend because once we are underwater on something it would have hurt the sort of balance sheet health of the business.

But at a turning point it could be beneficial to help boost the numbers just as momentum turns. And you know, I have to say I haven't seen any real signs of momentum turning right now, but logically you'd expect, we're already under 1x MNAV. So, you know, in my view, it's probably just a matter of time and I don't know if that's a week or several months or who knows. But yeah, it would be a better time ultimately to take on leverage now than it was a few months ago. But again, if we were to take on any, it would be quite small. Because that's the prudent thing to do. You want to make sure that in the event that there's an 80% drawdown, you know, if this is the start of an 80% drawdown that the company is totally safe with whatever amount of leverage is taken. So that's how we're thinking about it. I think ultimately other factors is the thing that weighs quite heavily.

**James:**
(0:36:11) Excellent. Moving on to prefs. I know Andrew's kind of made it very clear that it's a medium to long-term kind of thing. It's not a short-term thing, which makes perfect sense. So this isn't about why aren't we doing it now? But I guess I think they're brilliant and they've allowed Strategy to buy so much Bitcoin, it's insane. However, you know, until 9 months ago or 10 months ago, they didn't exist. Not in the form that Strategy have implemented them, which means they came out of nowhere which means it's possible right that other innovation could occur that also holds the, I don't know, the keys to Valhalla. Is that something that you think is also possible that maybe it's MSTR, maybe it's MetaPlanet, maybe it's SWC, but that some other financial engineering comes out and there's room for more than just prefs in the future?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:37:18) Yeah, I suppose that's possible. I frankly haven't thought about it that way. Certainly have to remain open to that.

I think the prefs are genius. I think that they are the thing that Bitcoin has been waiting for to enable the demonetization of all these TradFi pools of capital. The fact that everybody treats their stock portfolio or their bond portfolio as their savings account. And that has led to, you know, too much capital chasing not enough real value and everything's overvalued. And I think that, yeah, you know, you've seen the sort of diagrams I've made. I think that Bitcoin treasury companies are the piping, the plumbing by which we tap into those reservoirs and funnel capital into Bitcoin because Bitcoin will deliver the, you know, or products created by Bitcoin treasury companies will deliver the attributes that those fixed income and equity investors are looking for better than everything else that they can invest in, in my opinion. And then that capital ends up in Bitcoin.

And so I think that preferred equities are, I think we're going to look back on them being the key unlock for Bitcoin Treasury companies helping Bitcoin get to, you know, the multi-million dollar per coin valuations. I think it's sort of, you know, like if you had, it's wild, but I genuinely think that if you had to draw like one demarcation point in Bitcoin's history as an asset, like 20 years from now, if you look back and you say, if you had to say there are two chapters, what's the chapter break between them? I think it might end up being preferred equities coming around because they enabled Bitcoin treasury companies to eat the fixed income market. Like that's the scale of what I think preferred equities do.

And they're brilliant because they've given Strategy the ability to raise debt in exactly the way that they want. And remove many of the sort of liabilities of debt. In a funny way, the debt covenants that are thorns in the side of an issuer with traditional debt, the debt holders have a lot of power. They're the most senior in the capital stack. And they can be a pain in the ass for Saylor. And I know that they were. And that's why he created this new approach to raising debt because he was sick of the power that the fiat convertible note holders had over his business. And he was sick of the fact that it was callable. You know that he had to pay it back at some point. So he created a solution that he could package into an equity instrument that gives the debt holder the economic value, but it removes a lot of the legacy power that debt holders have and takes that back for the benefit of the company.

And basically makes the speculative attack mechanics much more frictionless, much easier to let that play out. The whole idea there, which I have a diagram for, is you know that if Bitcoin because of its properties and where it is in its early stage adoption will continue to grow, appreciate in purchasing power over time, meanwhile by design fiat is designed to debase over time. You have a target inflation rate which just means that's your target debasement rate. You let those two things play out over time if you, they diverge, right? So, Bitcoin gets more valuable, a dollar or a pound gets less valuable. The whole point of the speculative attack is borrow the dollars or the pounds, hold it for long enough for that disparity to widen and then use the resources that you now hold on the asset side of your balance sheet to pay down or realistically roll, refinance that fiat debt. And the crazy thing about the preferred equity instruments is he's structured them in a way where he never has to settle that debt. He just has to keep paying that coupon, that dividend every year, which basically approaches zero in terms of its value relative to that Bitcoin assets that you've acquired with that fiat capital.

So unbelievable innovation in my view. I think that's the place that any Bitcoin treasury company wants to get to. You do have to grow your balance sheet to a certain size. You know, I think that the markets need to be educated about what these things offer. Fixed income investors aren't aware of it. I was pitching Stretch to my dad for his retirement account and trying to explain it to him. I think conversations like that will continue to happen everywhere over the next decade in the US and then all these other markets as well. The UK has no concept of these, you know, this type of instrument. So Smarter Web if and when we get to that place will have a heavy lift of education. It looks like Strategy will be in the market as well at some point I expect with their own preferred equities in the UK that benefit the US company shareholders. But they will be doing, I think, a lot of the lifting to educate the market and seed the market. And Smarter Web, I hope, will be right there as well as the UK champion, that benefits UK shareholders and can help, buyers of Bitcoin powered preferred equities that offer fixed income properties can offer those buyers a way to diversify their issuers. You know that are you getting your exposure from Strategy or are you getting your exposure from Strategy and Smarter Web and you know that's a good idea if you're going to take risk about some novel new instrument and how you are diversifying your portfolio in that new novel instrument.

So, anyway, those are some of my thoughts on preferred equities. I think they make a ton of sense when you get to a certain stage of balance sheet size. And I think we are doing exactly what we need to be doing right now to head in that direction. But I do think the community should be aware that is quite a ways down the road.

**James:**
(0:45:37) Sure. And talking about quite a ways down the road. I was having a phone call with another SWC investor yesterday and something that we both kind of recognized was that at no real point has any treasury company kind of given any intonation about the further future. You know, what does a treasury company do, you know, assuming we're talking I don't know 30 years down the line, they've accumulated a boatload of Bitcoin, what now?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:46:19) Yeah. I mean hopefully we get to, yeah look forward to that. I think the way I think about it is that Bitcoin treasury companies are public companies specializing in delivering Bitcoin yield. And that is, you know, why most investors invest in a Bitcoin treasury company. And I think that is the mandate therefore that comes from shareholders, is deliver Bitcoin yield. And at the moment and for the next two decades plus probably, the way to do that in my view is to find TradFi capital, find fiat capital and ingest it in ways that you can increase Bitcoin per share, whether that's issuing equity for equity investors or if that's issuing fixed income preferred equity offers to fixed income capital, whatever makes sense to increase Bitcoin per share using really those tools and also the money market with a Stretch-like product.

And you know while Bitcoin is monetizing, which I think there's several decades of that still to go. Bitcoin treasury companies will have a huge opportunity to arbitrage fiat into Bitcoin. And that'll be the way to generate Bitcoin yield. But, you know, if you think super long term, in my view, there's going to be a handful of Bitcoin treasury companies in the world, maybe hundreds that have each carved out a little niche in their own capital market and regulatory framework and they will be specializing in delivering Bitcoin yield. By that point in time, you know, you will have developed this institutional culture of this is what we do and this is why we do it for shareholders and this is what they expect.

And when you reach an end state of Bitcoin's monetization where there's not fiat capital to help facilitate the flow, you know, from fixed income or the money market into Bitcoin. At that point in time I think it shifts to maybe it's Bitcoin lending to businesses who, you know, this already exists where some of the larger Bitcoin custodians lend to Bitcoin miners whose business is based in we need capex now and then we will deliver Bitcoin as a result of our operations. So, you know, there's a cottage industry for lending Bitcoin to miners to get a return in Bitcoin terms. And that I think would extend to, you know, as Bitcoin becomes the preferred capital for every business and every industry and it has stopped monetizing such so at that point in time it would in real terms be growing at a couple percent a year. And then in that future I think you start to see Bitcoin treasury companies, the best capitalized Bitcoin businesses in the world, increasingly shift towards, you know, lending or other, you know, whatever makes sense in that economic context for how do you deliver Bitcoin yield to shareholders? How do you grow Bitcoin ownership over time? And it might look like lending to Bitcoin miners does today and you get a return in Bitcoin terms and risk adjusted it makes sense. That might be how these things evolve. But you know the point is to grow that balance sheet and be the best capitalized business in a capital market such that you can leverage that position and that balance sheet to continue to generate Bitcoin yield through whatever makes sense.

**James:**
(0:51:08) This has just been asked on the chat. You can see that, right?

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:51:12) Mhm. Yeah. I have looked into this. I think it is not a framework that exists in the UK, return of capital for Stretch. It's a particular regulatory framework that exists in the US that doesn't exist in the UK. That much I've found out. So yeah, what I don't know is if it's possible to structure the same sort of attributes through a different structure but yeah HMRC doesn't have the same kind of thing that IRS and SEC guidance allows for in the US with return of capital exemption from your taxable income.

**James:**
(0:52:08) And then finally, I guess, did you have any other updates that you wanted to share about SWC? You know, recent developments, anything to look forward to, that kind of stuff.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:52:20) No, you know, I was watching from afar with the general meeting at Concord in Bristol. I look forward to attending our AGM which will be at the same spot. And I look forward to meeting everybody there and also checking out the Concord. Which I've never been able to do.

And yeah, you know, watching the event from afar, it was encouraging to see that by and large the shareholders who attended are unfazed, understand that the fundamentals of the business haven't changed. The background context, the sentiment for Bitcoin treasury companies globally has changed. And my view is that that'll end up being cyclical. It has been on a much smaller scale for MetaPlanet over its year and a half history. They've never had enthusiasm go to zero the way that it has over the last few months.

But I, you know, I don't think there's, I think logically the tide comes back in at some point. And yeah, so I'm excited to see that support is there, that people get it, and I'm excited about what's on the horizon for Smarter Web as a business. And you know, people have seen a little bit less of me. Uh recently I've been making slides. As part of, you know, getting the business ready for the next chapter. I also have had my hands a bit full with baby on the way due this sometime this week. So that's been part of it too.

But yeah, so I guess that's my sort of final message. I think that what I saw from the general meeting was people who get it and also a certain degree of British resolve too, the sort of holding on and hold fast determination of Brits which I think is quite suitable for Bitcoin volatility and Bitcoin treasury company volatility. Which amplifies Bitcoin's vol. You want that vol. Ultimately it feels very very painful when it's the less fun side of the vol but ultimately I think we are on the right path and even if you're not able to add much Bitcoin yield for the period of time where the oscillator has swung to zero enthusiasm globally for Bitcoin treasury companies. Well, you know, when the conditions make it possible to, well, when Smarter Web or any Bitcoin treasury company is able to deliver Bitcoin yield, even a modest amount during those conditions, that I think helps cause enthusiasm to come back, and then you can make hay in a bigger way.

**James:**
(0:56:05) Yeah. And Andy summarizes it right here. Well, thank you very much, Jesse. I hope all goes well with family over the coming weeks. And thank you again for taking the time to talk to me.

**Jesse Myers:**
(0:56:20) Yeah, thanks, James. Great doing this. Happy to do it again soon. Hopefully we have more to talk about soon.

**James:**
(0:56:28) Yeah, looking forward to it.
