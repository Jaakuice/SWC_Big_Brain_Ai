**True North Now Host:**
(0:00:00) Good morning everyone um to True North now episode two uh today I'm joined with Andrew Webbley CEO of the Smarter Web Company um we are currently streaming live on X this will be uploaded on I believe YouTube and the True North page at a later time but Andrew now that you're here with us here afternoon and or evening where you are morning where I am how are you doing how are you feeling um what are some of your thoughts with the market activity lately

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:00:30) Yes so we're doing okay actually um you know it's been another busy day um you know another pretty good day um you know the whole week's been you know non-stop with lots of different things we've been at different events in the UK we've done lots of um different things online you know we've put out a few announcements um yeah so I think we're in a better position at the end of the week than we were at the start of the week so yeah pretty good

**True North Now Host:**
(0:01:00) Excellent so you know some in the community perhaps are not familiar with who Smarter Web is who you are um give us a rundown on that you know how did a company start uh what's your employee base size for instance uh get into some details around the decision to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy and of course you know people are probably going to have like questions around um profitability core business things of that that nature um please give us some insight into that

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:01:30) Yes so I started my career in 1999 um I joined a small company that became one of the biggest companies in the UK um it's the largest investment broker in the UK they've got about a 40% market share um and I left that company being the head of online um so I normally describe it to people as a really well- paid apprenticeship um you know it was great because we listed the business on the stock market um and it you know it grew into a massive company um when I um sort of got to the end of my time there after 10 years I wanted to set up my own business so I'm a developer um and what I wanted to do is I wanted to build a content management system that I thought was you know one of the could be one of the best content management systems in the world um this is in the days before you know everyone had a content management system for a website you know a lot of people did but not everyone everyone does now um so I built a system and then I built a business around the system um so everything that we do is designed around the system you know how we how we service clients how we support clients how we build clients literally everything is focused around the system what that means is that we can be in incredibly efficient um which obviously translates you know to the profitability of the business so the business you know it's been around for 15 years um and it's been profitable every single year in those 15 years you know only as a small business um but profitable nevertheless um what I decided to do so I um you know obviously I love investing and then I found Bitcoin almost 10 years ago um and then about 5 years ago I found a company called Micro Strategy obviously called Strategy Now and I thought it was the best thing in the world you know taking a public company and taking Bitcoin and combining the two basically you know in simple terms um so I started investing in that and then obviously as time went on you know there were some others um and then you know because I'm from the UK you know I've lived in the UK all my life my kids live in the UK um I I felt probably about two years ago maybe slightly longer now that you know why doesn't the UK have such a thing you know um you know I I still hold shares in Strategy and I think I hold about six um different Bitcoin related public companies at the moment um you know one in France uh one in Japan um you know the rest are in America I believe off the top of my head apart from obviously one that I hold in the UK um you know um so basically I couldn't find a company in the UK um and I you know we all love where we live you know we like other countries but we also love where we live you know we buy food from where we live and you know all that sort of stuff um so I kept looking you know I was checking the news feeds every day thinking you know this is the most obvious thing in the world you know why isn't anyone doing it it doesn't make any sense um and then it got to last year probably the middle of last year just after you know just after the summer um 2024 um and no one was doing it or or they certainly weren't doing it how I thought it should be done so I bit the bullet and I decided that I would list my business on the stock market um which is exactly what I did

**True North Now Host:**
(0:05:00) Going public: Listing SmarterWeb on the Aquis Stock Exchange

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:05:00) We we seriously started the process um maybe December uh 2024 um so it took about four and a bit months four months something like that um between seriously starting it and being listed on the stock market you know we listed on the stock market in April 2025 um 25th of April 2025 um in the UK we've got two stock markets we've got the London Stock Exchange and then we've got the Aquis Stock Exchange um you can trade them dependent on where you are in the world um you know relatively easily it's it's harder for people outside of the US outside of the UK you know it's getting easier in in Europe but um we've got these two stock markets and the Aquis is basically a growth market so it's where smaller growing companies list because it's quicker to get listed and it's cheaper um what we've actually done um which is which is something I'm very very proud of is in just under two months of being listed we've become the biggest company there's almost 100 companies on Aquis we started as one of the smallest and today we are um we're the biggest by far probably more than twice two and a half times um you know the the next one down um you know today we passed a billion pound market cap uh this this um this year so far bearing in mind we've only been listed for 2 months uh we are the best performing UK equity by far you know between the two markets you know we're one of the most liquid stocks between the two markets you know we're you know off the top of my head maybe in the top 50 of of of the liquid stocks you know I saw some data today earlier today from you know my former employee Harris Landstone and with the second most dealt equity you know out of the global equities that they cover so you know it's certainly gaining some traction um and you know people are taking notice I think of you know what we're doing as a business um you know it's probably worth touching on the actual business because that's the sort of the journey of how we got to here today but you know I'm really proud of my business um and and so so I can explain that so the the best way of understanding the Smarter Web Company is to think that we are three things so we're an operating business that's been around for you know quite a few years that's profitable um that's got over 250 websites um you know clients um probably 30% plus reoccurring revenue uh really good profit margins um because the work is you know an element of it is reoccurring revenue which is like a hosting model really um and then the project fees you know we're very very efficient how we do those projects to a very high standard but efficiently so we're an operating business doing you know web design web development and online marketing and then we've got the middle prong which is an acquisition strategy which is um something for the longer term you know medium to long term let's say um and then the third bit which you know obviously everyone wants to talk to me about is you know my belief of of of you know how you should manage your treasury so for many years myself personally I haven't attached much value to the pound or the dollar or the euro um and what I believe um which has worked out quite well so far is that Bitcoin is a much better thing to hold your your um your your assets in um so you know rather than holding you know whatever it is in your bank account um you know after your day-to-day living costs of course um you know in terms of the money that you're saving for the future you know if you hold it in Bitcoin it's a better store of value simple as that um so as a business you know because I set up the business it's my vision um you know etc etc you know we do exactly that it's no more complicated than that so the the excess capital spare capital whatever you want to call it that we have in in our business I hold for for the benefit of the business and therefore it shareholders in the asset that I believe is the best asset in the world so you know what a traditional company may do is they might hold some pounds you know in cash they might hold some pounds in say guilts you know government bonds effectively um they might hold you know some equities or some you know gold exposure or whatever you know we simply hold our excess capital in Bitcoin because that's what I believe in and they're the three prongs to the business so an operating business an acquisition strategy and how we manage our treasury um and that in a nutshell is the smarter web company

**True North Now Host:**
(0:10:00) That's a great overview thank you and Bitcoin strategy: How SmarterWeb is stacking sats for the long haul let's get into some specifics on the um Bitcoin acquisitions i have some notes here because I want to make sure that I'm very very specific um you recently acquired approximately 104 Bitcoin your total holdings are about 346 Bitcoin average cost basis of around 105,000 and around 36 million US purchase does that sound about right in terms of your world coin acquisitions

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:10:30) Perfect yeah

**True North Now Host:**
(0:10:35) Now I know that you have a um path an immediate near-term path that you want to set forth towards a,000 Bitcoin so let's talk about that and also once you hit that 1,000 goal I know whether you can discuss too many details about or not once you hit that thousand bitcoin marker what are some longerterm goals that you'd like to set for the smart web company in terms of acquisition

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:11:00) Yeah so um you know so far we've got off to quite a good start with how we've um deployed the treasury and generated new capital into Bitcoin um so so what I want to do is is you know I want to get to a,000 Bitcoin when we we decided to list the business my um uh my myself and and Tyler Evans who's a non-executive director and you know he he and I are the people that set out the strategy together you know for the future and the path that we're on um we said to each other that we want to get to a,000 Bitcoin um quicker than a very well-known company did it who are amazing um and so what we said to ourselves is wouldn't it be cool if rather than get rather than getting to a,000 Bitcoin in 6 months we could get to 1,000 Bitcoin in 4 months um now using publicly available information you know you're you're you're 100% right with what you said our uh most recent disclosed Bitcoin holdings are we updated the market on that recently we always update the market because you know I believe in transparency and respect so we treat our shareholders with respect by giving them transparency um what what what we can do or what you can do rather is you can look at the cash that the business has got from looking at the fundraising activities that we've we've done and the Bitcoin that we've got um and you you can get to a figure of you know 700ish Bitcoin you know give or take say 30 40 50 um as you know where we are at you know round about now um you know what what we can't do is we can't say you know anything on top of what we've disclosed close to the market but you can see that we've got that pathway with the capital that we've got you know literally now um so that's quite good because what that means is um you know let's fast forward a week for example that will be approximately 2 months after we listed and people can say there's a reasonable chance that they've got round about you know 7/10 of what they said they wanted to get within 4 months so what we did um recently is um on Thursday morning I believe in the UK um so that would be um yesterday um we we actually announced a second fundraising strategy that we've got which is um it's a bit like in the states an ATM um where

**True North Now Host:**
(0:13:00) Oh ask about that so perfect thank you for getting into that yeah so so so so if you if you view what we've done to date in terms of how we've raised funds um which you know has always been at the market in terms of the price um and has been you know in in in you know with with decent strategic um investors who have been incredibly supportive um then you can see that we've got that strategy um and then we've got another strategy that we announced yesterday um which is that side of things so um that's a very long way long- winded answer of saying you know I believe that we will comfortably beat my targets um but I wouldn't want to and I'm probably not allowed to say you know we're going to do it in you know x months for example but it'll be well within four months in my opinion of course and um again just want to make sure I have the details correctly that's with Shard Capital you have a subscription agreement of up to 21 million shares they're doing an initial trunch or block of 7 million I believe right and Fundraising edge: Unique UK share facility inspired by U.S. ATM models um let's get into some details on that in the UK it doesn't seem like there is a easy way to do an ATM equity like offering so from my understanding this is something rather unique that you've pioneered in terms of um the UK market of how to raise capital and raise equity and buy Bitcoin and how did you without getting into too many details that you can't share how do you come across that as a potential opportunity and was it very very difficult to get that approved and scaled or or was it was it a relatively straightforward process once you had the the mechanism identified

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:14:30) Yeah so when I first decided to list the business you know we've got great advisers you know there's lots of different companies that we've worked with on the legal side the accounting side the broking side um but what I found in the early stages is you know I would say you know why are we doing it like that you know why aren't we doing it like this you know this is too complicated let's simplify it you know because you know I'm an investor and when I look at companies I want um you know sort of I don't want things to be complicated for unnecessary reasons um you know there's a lot of that that goes on which um perhaps you know in my opinion isn't isn't necessary so it's quite funny you see because in in in the UK um and with my company we had we had a lot of that going on at the start and then as time has gone on and I've shown them that you know the way that I think it should be done um you know seems to work um they've been more receptive to that so what you can do in the UK um and people do it from time to time but in a way that I don't like because I don't believe the investors benefit there are a way or or ways that you can do deals with third parties um and they can effectively give you money rather than you placing it with traditional equity so it's not dissimilar from the the deal that we announced but when you dive into the detail behind that you'll see that the company's not doing as well as they should um they're almost being taken advantage of so with our advisor um Tennis and Securities um we talked it through and this has taken weeks you know people only found out about it yesterday but it took us weeks um we started talking we said look this is what we want to do um you know this should be possible I want the company to benefit from it you know as as you know not not that the people facilitating the deal don't get a fair pay um you know they get you know approximately 3% which is actually better slightly better than um when you do a fundraising unless you've done the fundraising yourself um and is very comparable with um how a large company much larger than us would do an ATM facility in the states so I priced it around that because I thought that's what you know these other companies that are doing very very good things do um but I didn't want there to be you know hidden fees initial fees all this sort of rubbish which basically doesn't benefit the company and the investors so um you know it took a bit of time um you know it was um it I wouldn't say it was easy to do it um but it it was just thinking right this is what we want to do you know this should be possible let's get the appropriate advice from you know the brokers the lawyers um get all the paperwork drafted up find a good partner that we can trust that's going to do it in a respectful way um and all those things and you know I'm really pleased um I'm really pleased with how we've put it together um time will tell how well it works um you know and if it's a you know a good way of um generating additional capital for the business I I believe it will be um if you look at the details of what we announced so I didn't want anyone to be scared when they read it so that's why when I put in the announcement which again was written in plain English like everything else that I do that's why I put we will not sell those shares below the closing price of the previous day so if the price closes at X we cannot sell below X you know and then the next day the price closes at Y we cannot sell below Y so you know in simple terms you can't sell on a down day yeah um and then I also put another clause in there saying you cannot sell more than 20% of the volume um so you know obviously if you're a liquid stock um you know there's there's volume so it wouldn't work if you didn't have liquidity um but I wanted people to realize that you know yes you know being perfectly honest there will be a um you know a slight impact on the price because you know the company has got the right if they want to to sell you know a modest amount of of shares um but I didn't want people thinking that you know we're just going to be you know putting a lid on the price or anything because that's not the intention the intention is to get the balance right for the shareholders by generating new capital for the business and then the final thing we did um so you said about the 21 million shares that's what we put into the facility you Implementation: Share sale rules and investor safeguards know 21 million shares at the current share price is approximately you knowundred million pounds of new capital you know equity capital with no debt no strings nothing so what we didn't want to do is we didn't want to scare people and them to think that that's such a big number obviously I wanted the 21 million number for obvious reasons so what we said is we'll put 7 million into the facility Um and then if that gets a positive reaction over a period of time then you know we'll put another X which might be 7 million might be 14 million obviously less than you know no more than 14 million because the total's 21 million into the facility and then once the facility is complete um we'll then um you know sort of potentially you know do the same again if that's in the best interests of the companies and when you get to the end of each tranch we'll update the market and we'll say "Right we sold seven million shares you know the average price was X therefore we raised X for the company." Um so it's a really cool um innovative thing um that I'm hoping that other companies can see and then they can think yeah that's a sensible way of raising capital in addition to you know offering retail investors um the opportunity you know getting supportive institutional investors you know and the other sorts of things that you know we're doing on the equity side as opposed to anything else

**True North Now Host:**
(0:20:00) So when I take a look at um what what I read about your plan and what you just said if we compare it to Micro Strategy we all know they have the ATM equity offerings and now they have multiple rungs that they can they can um leverage in terms of leveraging um ATM equity to buy Bitcoin then we have MetaPlanet that uses moving strike warrants and they have somewhat of a sell into strength model now your model it seems like you have a far more aggressive approach towards being market neutral and selling into strength if I'm understanding it correctly if you are not trying to sell below the previous days closing price and and you're keeping that rolling forward that means that that sentiment kicks up you are selling into that sentiment so I think that again if it works which we which you're hoping it does and which everyone thinks it does that is a somewhat novel approach but the follow-up question I have with that is I'm assuming that it's something that is scalable so that if the 21 million works then you can do 42 63 so on and so on and so forth or will you have any kind of local regulatory caps that'll prevent you from scaling it

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:21:00) No so um that's a great question so when before I listed the business I got everything so I'm really proud of you know all the minute detail in the business and that's what what you see basically when you look at us as a whole um and you know every little bit of what we do you know I've I've sort of looked at you know in the best possible light to make it perfectly structured in my opinion for the future so what I did is before we listed the business I made sure that we had more than adequate headroom um I haven't done the calculation in the last day or two um but but what what excess headroom means is as a company you've been given the authority by your shareholders to uh raise capital for the benefit of the business and normally what you've got in the UK if you're LSE listed there's a cap on that is currently at 20% I believe so you can raise 20% you know of effectively of your market cap you know 20% more shares um on um the Aquis exchange you can raise to your headroom room so if you haven't got enough headroom then what you have to do is you have to go to your shareholders there's a you know you know a bureaucratic process that will take a couple of weeks to request the headroom you know obviously it costs money to do that sort of process um and then you you get more headroom um so it's quite unusual in the UK um to have a company like our company where we've got um considerably more headroom um than the shares in issue so um you know as a ratio and don't quote me on this but you know we've probably got 10 to 15% of the shares in issue relative to the actual headroom that's been authorized and you get that authorization for a year so hopefully everyone can see when they you know get to know me and um you know people can ask me questions and you know that's all good they can see that you know I'm aligned like everyone else in the business you know this is the most important thing to me financially in the world by far and it's also a business that I'm very very proud of um so hopefully they can see that you know I won't abuse that um headroom position but I structured it like that so that you know let's say the the um the facility that we launched the other day goes very very well then exactly that 42 63 etc etc whatever the liquidity and the demand allows um if you think about it if you take a step back for a moment you know we invest in companies because we want the share price to go up um and sometimes because we believe in what they're doing the ideal scenario is both of those yeah you believe in them and you think the share price is going to go up so we're all we're really saying with this if you think about it at sort Scaling up: How headroom and capital plans fuel SmarterWeb's growth of like a psychological level is that we're just saying that the company can be even more stronger um you know even stronger if the company has access to more capital you know the balance sheet is therefore healthier so you know let us share in some of that price appreciation um to um to grow the business and trust us that we'll do it in a sensible way um so that you know the share price can still move and things so um you know if if you think about the company with the share price today and yesterday as an example um you know both days were reasonable on the share price um you know how it went up um so I'm I don't think people can say that the facility on a very very short you know sample of two days um you know doesn't have some merits um and and I'm massively looking forward to you know seeing how it goes and evaluating the progress and using it as you know the second lever in in our model and and obviously as we grow and grow and grow then we'll have a third lever a fourth lever a fifth lever and etc you know so this is like you know we've got another new tool in the toolbox it's a really good tool um you know a proper power tool in fact um and and yeah we're pretty excited about it

**True North Now Host:**
(0:25:00) So let's talk about some of those um potential levers so one of the things that we often hear about in the community is the talk of a Bitcoin treasury company or leverage Bitcoin equity however I want to draw a distinction at the moment if my understanding is full and correct you are a Bitcoin treasury company you have done capital raises and you you're using um equity offerings equity like offerings to put up Bitcoin on your balance sheet but currently you're not doing any leverage you have not taken on any kind of convertible notes or anything to that nature and this isn't me saying whether that is a good or a bad approach what I what I want to bring up is given the fact that you have these two levers these two rungs that you can currently pull right now and you mentioned that you would be looking into the future of having a third fourth and fifth I would assume that convertible notes and other similar facilities would be on your radar wouldn't they

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:25:30) Yeah yeah of course so you know I look at everything um you know I'm an investor in you know quite a few different companies in this space have been for a very very long time um and you know I love what these different companies are doing and I look at them and I think well you know that's good you know that could work and you know that has worked and all these sorts of things you know in the UK the capital markets you've got the same sort of tools as you've got in the US you know Japan France etc um you know my job as the CEO is to decide what I want to implement and when I want to implement it um you know I I believe in in my opinion that the best thing for our business is to be debt free which we are no debt um which is quite good um you know it means that should there be a downturn you know there's there's no problem there you know we've got an operating business that's been profitable for 15 years um you know so I I I think that I've got the model right as I see it in my head um you know now when we get bigger and bigger and bigger um you know without putting a a a threshold on it because you know obviously we've you know flown to that1 billion pound um level pretty quickly actually um you know at some point it might be appropriate to effectively take a small amount of debt you know as an example um which you know some of the companies have done fantastically well um I've I've already had lots and lots of people give me lots and lots of different deals um including deals that were nowhere near as good as um the facility that I announced you know the ATM like facility um so you know I've I've I've already been offered lots and lots of different things um you know some of them are better than others obviously um you know but but there's some really good people that I get on very very well that are very keen to do things some of those people have joined in our equity raises when I've said you know we don't want to do like a convert for example at the moment others have said well you know we can't support you at this stage and and that's fine that's their opinion that's my my opinion um what what I think I will always do is I will do my very very best to make sure that the business is run in a responsible way um because I you know this is you know my life's work you know my my financial future in addition to you know the responsibility that I've got for all of those different shareholders so I just need to be very very careful about that but I think what people can see is you know using my um ATM style facility you know I can generate 100 million pounds approximately of equity you know equity no debt you know that's that's a pretty good number um you know we we've got a treasury that's over 50 million pounds already um you know a little bit more the public available information No debt, no problem: Building a treasury-driven business without leverage would have to be used for that so you know that would get us to you know 150 plus million pounds in our treasury um alongside the operating business that's profitable you know obviously looking a bit small relative to that at that point um but but that's so cool if you can do that with no debt so I I'm always looking at things because you know I every single day every single week I want to be in a better position than I was the day before the week before um but I also want to so I won't rule anything out but I also want to make the right decisions at the right time um and I think that that's what a good CEO CEO will do and funnily enough those right decisions aren't just um they aren't just you know whether it's debt or equity for example um but they're also things like how much do you raise um you know so in some of the raises that we've done I think the last two off the top of my head um we've never scaled the retail investors down but we've scaled some of the institutions down ever so slightly um because it's about getting the right amount of money at the right time um you know every aspect of what we're doing as a business is something that I've modeled um through all different financial scenarios as well and you know I think what we're doing at the moment is um the right thing for the smarter web company at the moment Um and we have considered some alternative things and we will consider them in the future but I'm convinced that for the very very short term what we're doing is is is the right thing for the business and therefore its shareholders

**True North Now Host:**
(0:30:00) Awesome so let's now talk about the reality of Bitcoin in the UK so we all know what Strategy has done right they are they have set the standard in terms of growth in terms of Bitcoin acquisition and as a as a contrast you have MetaPlanet that exists in Japan they are serving as a not for lack of a better term standalone vehicle for Bitcoin exposure in Japan in the UK you have some unique dynamics as well um for instance and please correct me if I'm wrong you cannot hold IBIT for example unless you are institutional investor um strategy serves as the primary form of um Bitcoin ex Bitcoin exposure for the UK market I would say in terms of um like a leverage Bitcoin equity and now you have smarter web that's coming in in in the form of another option that didn't exist before in the UK market h have you been hearing feedback from the local market from local regulators from local investors that are seeing it in that way are they starting to see smarter web as a potential vehicle for um you know bitcoin expo exposure in the market i know you have other companies in the UK that do have some bitcoin on the balance sheet and like you have um pointsium I believe that also is doing a um treasury model but what kind of feedback have you gotten from the local market in terms of what you're doing and what it means for local market in the form of like bitcoin exposure

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:31:00) Yeah I think it's been pretty positive on the whole um so you know I've invested in the states for you know um almost 20 years maybe um you know the states are you know it's the best market in the world um you know and then on the flip side of that the UK market's been pretty poor um for probably you know 10 years maybe you know it had a brief sort of pop I suppose over co but um it wasn't a real pop it was just you know people bored at home you know sort of looking at UK stocks you know I'm not sure whether any good companies sort of came out of that pop um so um so the UK markets haven't been great um you're 100% right in the sense that it's quite difficult for private individuals in the UK to get Bitcoin exposure so you know I've been buying Bitcoin for many years um you know I know how to buy it I know where to buy it I know which banks I can use and all this sort of stuff you know there's quite restrictive limits with some banks you know for example you might not be able to buy more than you know £3,000 worth or £5,000 worth or whatever um you know there's some banks um you know where you can't buy any they won't allow it um or you have to do it in a different way because of you know the platform that you use to get around you know like using a card or a direct bank transfer for example and then you know you pay much much larger fees so it's pure Bitcoin in the UK ignoring the fact that some people aren't comfortable holding it through a wallet and things you know is it it is a bit of a tricky one um and then the other thing that you've got is even though in the States you've had um you know ETFs since you know I believe it was something like March last year um in the UK you haven't got them um yet um so that's why you know or one of the reasons why you know people have used Bitcoin treasury companies like Micro Strategy um to get that exposure the the advantage also that you've got is in the UK we've got things called um pensions SIPs um self-invested personal pensions and ISIS which is like a kind of like the same as a as a pension but you get the tax relief UK limits: Why Bitcoin exposure is tough for local retail investors um on the way out because you don't pay any tax on the way out but you don't get the tax relief on the way in but same sort of product just a you know a basket to hold investments and then they're free of tax um until they come out you know or whatever so because a lot of people in the UK have got an awful lot of money in in their pensions and their ISIS um you know they can't buy Bitcoin with that because they can't buy pure Bitcoin because it's not allowed um and um they can't have any access or the vast majority of people can't have any access to you know ETFs because you can't even buy the ones in the states you know because the the FCA has dictated that they are not suitable um so that will change and that is changing so the way that I look at it is that you know we we follow a lot of things that happen in America um so I've always believed that you know if you had asked me two months ago I would have said within the next two years we'll have Bitcoin ETFs in this country um they actually announced a couple of weeks ago that they starting a consultation period um and I believe that probably by September October something like that retail investors in the UK will be able to buy Bitcoin ETFs um that that's that's what I believe anyway um so it's getting better um I think what we've done which is quite a cool thing and certainly wasn't the plan you know I'm very focused on the smarter web company um you know this is about doing something that I believe in in the right way um not doing the usual public company thing where they're you know sort of not delivering or trying to deliver pure value for their shareholders um one sort of side effect that's come out of it which is sort of quite comical actually um is you've got lots of other smaller companies coming out there saying "Yeah what about me you know we've got a Bitcoin Treasury policy now." And you know it's it's quite surreal actually i you know when I check the news feeds at 7:00 every morning I see that now there are some great comps um you know I will watch with interest to see how aggressively they do it how well they manage it and all that side of things and I really hope that they succeed um but away from them I'm not aware of anyone in the UK that that is actively pursuing the strategy um you know I'm watching maybe seven or eight different companies and I'm I'm hoping that some of them start saying "Right we've bought some Bitcoin this is what we're doing this is our strategy this is how we see you know the model developing." But um it's a really interesting time and it's so fantastic to see the equity markets in the UK that have been pretty poor to be fair for many years you know have some excitement again and people say "Oh actually I like what these guys are doing." Um and then get behind them and stuff so you know it's it's definitely one of those um you know surreal moments that that's come out of what we've done that you know you've you you've almost created something and then a load of other stuff has been created alongside it um you know but you know just it's worth remembering that you know really what we're doing is what's some something that's worked incredibly well in other countries you know so take um or take any of them you know um you know an operating business with a Bitcoin treasury policy you know the the secret um which you know I don't mind sharing um you know because it's not really a secret is it all comes down to the execution at the end of the day so you know I believe that most people providing they're prepared to put the effort in they can you know come up with a simple version of what we're doing um but the execution of that is is a little bit harder than some people think um you know and the work that goes involved in that you know every single day to keep pushing it forward um is perhaps something that people um underestimate you know um so takes a lot of endurance

**True North Now Host:**
(0:36:00) Yeah yeah it does and and it's it is the best job in the world that I've got you know there's so many people that have been so kind you know obviously you get the odd troll and things but you know that's life but there's so many people that have reached out and they've said "What you've done is changed my life you paid off my mortgage you've paid for my holiday you've allowed me to get married." Or you know whatever you know like I went to an event the the other night and you know must have been three or four people came up to me and one guy was you know it was you know he was so emotional um you know I thought he was going to cry um you know because he said you know it it changed his life and and it's such a you know I feel so lucky to you know have have had that experience so far and you know as long as I can keep doing my job properly pushing the company forward over many many months and years then I hope that we can help other people providing they believe that it's the sort of thing that they want to invest in um you know and and and you know going back to the transparency point you know we include things like in our announcements we include all the risk warnings and things because we believe that we believe it's an opportunity that people should have you know going back to the regulation piece um you know so so we've given them that opportunity but whether you're investing in us or you're investing in something else you need to put the effort in and the time in and the work in to understand what you're investing in um and and I think that that's what investors need to do whether they're investing in this space or anything else they need to make sure that they understand what they're investing in so they understand the risk that they're taking Transparency & risk: Educating investors while scaling community support with things um you know because you know when I invest in something I look at the strategy i look at who the people are i look at their track record you know I look at how hard they work or how hard I think they work um and all those things and people need to be very aware of that stuff but you know I believe that we're you know sort of um doing things pretty well at the moment um we're certainly trying our best um and um you know I've been really pleased with the the reception that we've got um you know from the UK retail investors you know we've got a great community that's built up on X and all this stuff but also by the other players you know whether it's the advisers or you know the other companies you know it's it's quite cool to see that we've you know started something in the UK that's heavily inspired by the global players um but you know we've got that ball rolling and um that's something that I'm quite proud of as well

**True North Now Host:**
(0:39:00) So talking so talk about that a little bit more you know one of the narratives that strategy dealt with in the US was when they launched their um treasury plan and they started moving along with it and started scaling it and then the news of the ETFs being approved um came through there was a narrative building that why would people own strategy why would they just buy the the the IBA ETF uh the Ivan ETF is going to eat into strategies um you know growth and it's going to eat into their um narrative of of being worth a premium over their net asset value um have you heard anything similar in the UK considering that you mentioned that you know while not right now in the next x number of months it may be possible that we are seeing some movement on the ETFs getting approved for the UK and being opened up to retail investors and you know how would you handle that because obviously as a strategy investor myself full disclosure to anyone watching that is not a narrative I agree with so I was just curious as to are you hearing anything like that and how how would you plan on addressing that when someone inevitably brings it up as a consideration

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:40:00) Yeah so there's two ways that I think about that question actually um so on one hand um you know if you invest in a company that holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet you are you're expecting some sort of return in excess of the return that you would get from holding Bitcoin because otherwise you would hold Bitcoin um so I hold Bitcoin myself and I hold a lot more in Bitcoin treasury companies um including our own of course um now that's not right for everyone but that's what I think the best approach is for you know me and my family so Bitcoin is obviously the best asset in the world by far the only thing that's better than Bitcoin in my opinion is compound Bitcoin um or leverage Bitcoin if you want to call it that not leverage in the traditional sense of the word but basically Bitcoin that builds more Bitcoin for you um so when I think about a Bitcoin treasury company or a public company with Bitcoin on the balance sheet I think about how are they going to get me more Bitcoin for my money um you know and it's as simple as that so if I was investing in an ETF for example I would be doing that for convenience maybe or within one of the tax rappers but it's not quite the same product as you know a Bitcoin treasury company for example so that's one of the things that I'd say there the the other way that I would answer it is I would say you know over the um eight eight nine years whatever it is that I've been investing in Bitcoin I've heard loads of narratives and I've seen a few things that have been true as well um so you know there's always a narrative of you know you know and and to be fair for for balance there are narratives on why it may go up as well as why it may go down you know I I um I listen to these narratives in the sense that I try and keep my ear to everything but I'm I'm not really that concerned with any of them because you know if we look at Bitcoin historically um you know it's it's you know by far over the long term way better than anything else and I believe you know that Bitcoin is going into the millions and then beyond um you know in in a period of time so you know I I'm not really that that concerned about these things because the only people that I hear saying things about you know ETFs are going to do that you know I heard all of that last year and I got quite sick of hearing that in America you know and if you look at what actually happened you know because you know I'm I'm a big believer in looking at data and numbers and and working out the probability of things you know if we you know we don't even have to do that with this scenario because we can just look at what happened in America and how well our strategy did afterwards um you know when when the ETFs came out so um yeah I'm pretty relaxed about it i actually see it as a massive positive um because it's it's furthering the adoption um it's a rubber stamp from the FCA saying Bitcoin is not this bad terrible thing that we've been telling you for you know 10 years that you know we we've been making you feel like a criminal for owning the best asset in the world um so I actually see it as a really positive thing when that happens and you know anything that makes Bitcoin better makes Bitcoin within public companies better you know funnily enough what we were talking about a moment ago about other companies cropping up and that's why I said you know I'm really looking forward to companies that do it well whether it's in the UK or or anywhere else in the world because anything that makes Bitcoin stronger makes us stronger and that's one of the things that's really cool about it in my opinion

**True North Now Host:**
(0:43:00) I'm inclined to agree and one I just had an exchange with a few people online that you know asked kind of a similar question about um smarter web and and strategy and whatnot and I think the simplest way to think about it is kind of like what you just mentioned you're not investing Bitcoin vs. ETFs: Why companies holding BTC might beat just owning it in it instead of Bitcoin because it's better than Bitcoin you're saying that because of Bitcoin you want a dollar for-doll proportional increase on the return you'll see so they're looking for that 1.5 to 3x on top of Bitcoin and many of us I can't speak for you but I know I've done it i've held a variety of these these different um companies and instruments and I've just bought bore Bitcoin with the with the gains so it is not a instead of bitcoin it is a because of bitcoin that a lot of these investments are that's what strategy is that's what you know metaplanet similar scientific and I believe that's what you're trying to be as well so um in closing I think those those are all my general questions that I had this is just the first interaction I'm hoping to have with you on the true north now platform um if you would like to share any closing thoughts with the um live watchers we have on Twitter or x sorry keep calling it Twitter um please feel free to do

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:44:00) Well I think the only thing that I'd like to say is you know how grateful I am to everyone for getting behind us and supporting us you know we are doing our best uh we are working hard we are trying to deliver you know the stated strategy that we've made very very clear to everyone you know we've got an amazing community that's built up on X completely organically you know there's um well I can't really remember how many numbers that members there are now it's going up you know it's going fast it's going very very fast it has yeah it's it's it's you know I I I try and check in there every day and see what they're doing you know there's some really cool tools that people are building um there's one guy uh Nick B on on X um I almost said Twitter as well then uh and he's um he he's he's built this whole amazing smarter web dashboard he's got the Webly tracker on there you know he's putting he's putting the work in as well just like we're putting the work in um and it's just amazing to see all this stuff you know we we you know we're we're um you know honored and humbled that people you know think that you know it's a company that they would like to um support um and we take that support very very seriously um and you know we're we're certainly doing our best and you know outside of the UK you know there's loads of conversations that I'm having with people all over the world um and that's amazing too you know to have one of the things that I said at the start was I wanted to build a really big company um that the UK could be proud of and you know we're just starting that mission obviously um but you know hopefully over the coming you know weeks months and years you know we can fulfill that mission and then and then grow and grow from there you know we could be um you know um at the start I said I want to be one of the biggest 100 companies in the UK you know we're probably ranking with the biggest couple of hundred already actually um but you know maybe we could become the biggest company in the UK who knows um you know and and then um you know just keep growing from there and you know just be something that the UK can be proud of you know a company with hardworking people that that that really is aligned with the shareholders and trying to you know deliver things um you know as best they can and you know I'm just just grateful that people have you know supported what I set out to do it means a lot to me
