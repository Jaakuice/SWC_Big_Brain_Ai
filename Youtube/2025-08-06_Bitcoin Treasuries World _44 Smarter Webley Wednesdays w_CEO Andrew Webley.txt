**Anders:**
(0:00:00) Good after evening. Good afternoon, good evening from uh Copenhagen in Europe, Denmark and uh also good late afternoon from uh UK. Um and welcome to Smarter Webley Wednesday. Good to see you, Andrew. How are you doing?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:00:21) Yeah, I'm doing um pretty good today actually. Um yeah, I've come back from a week's holiday um which which was nice. Um holiday

**Anders:**
(0:00:28) Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:00:35) Well, I I've worked, you know, I've run the business before we listed for 15 years, and you know, there's not really any such thing as a switch off holiday, you know, when you run a business. Um, so it's indifferent in that regard. Um, but it was good. Yeah, I had a few meetings over there. Um, we we did a fund raise that we announced on Monday morning, a small fund raise with one institutional investor, one high net worth. Um, you know, we've obviously had the news that's come out today. Um, so yeah, it was it was a nice break. Thank you.

**Anders:**
(0:01:06) Yeah, you're welcome. And it's good to see you again. I had Jesse on last Wednesday, but why don't you tell us a bit about the announcement this morning since it's fresh off the press and not not maybe not everyone's heard about it. Um,

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:01:19) yeah. So, um, we announced something that's very significant for us this morning. It's called Smarter Convert. Um, so effectively what it is is it's an interestfree loan. Um, so it's it's technically it's debt, but it's uh do denominated in Bitcoin. Um, so what that means is that we have the $21 million which is converted into Bitcoin will convert 100% of it into Bitcoin. Um, so that will be Bitcoin on the balance sheet just like the other Bitcoin that's on the balance sheet. Um and then if that does not convert into equity over the life of the instrument which is 12 months um then the investor tobam has got the right to ask for their bond to be repaid which means we give them the bitcoin back. So if bitcoin goes up in value we give them back more than $21 million. If bitcoin goes down in value we give them back less than $21 million because we give them back the bitcoin. So for a company of our size, it's really smart um because what it means is that we're not exposing ourselves for a short time period when we're smaller um you know to to that fiat currency risk with the volatility of the underlying asset. Um so it I I think that it's been really well structured because what what it allowed us to do is it allowed us to raise money above the current market price. So, uh, when we priced it, which was last night, the share price was 1.95. So, they can convert it into equity at approximately 2 pound5. It's 2.0475 to be exact. Um, so it's slightly less dilution, 5% less dilution if it converts into equity. But then for the second half of the the 12 months, we've got the right to demand to force that they convert it into equity if it's 50% higher. So um there is literally no downside for the company. In fact, there's only upside because if it doesn't convert into equity, we don't even give them 100% back of the Bitcoin. We give them 98% of it back. Um, so you know, it's really really good. And Tobam are a great a great company. They've been established since 2006. Um, and one little thing that we didn't put in the RNS. Um, but you know, I've seen a few comments today is so in 20 years they've been established and they've never shorted a stock in their life. So, if you were doing a traditional convertible, so I've got people that would offer me tens of millions of dollars to do a fear-based convertible with a small coupon. A longer time period we could do, but that would be exposing ourselves to the the coupon and it would be exposing ourselves to the feat risk. But then also the thing that a lot of people don't understand is the the traditional convert people, they will short the hell out of your stock because literally they're all all they're trying to do is to hedge the risk that they're taking in the convert aspect of the product. Whereas this thing that we've devised, the Bitcoin denominated um uh product that we've called smart to convert, it doesn't have that. It's a different profile. there is no incentive to short it. Um, and you know, we wouldn't do it with investors that wanted to do that sort of a thing. So, yeah, I'm really pleased to be working with them. I've got the utmost respect for them. Um, and they've been great to work together on this. Um, and I'm very much looking forward to working with them in the future. The other thing that's quite cool about it um is that um up until today um since we IPOed basically um we haven't had an institutional investor that we've been able to name. Um so we've got UTXO who supported us on the preIPO. Tyler joined the board, you know, great guys, very very supportive. Um so so we've had them since the start, but since then we've not had a named institutional investor that we've been able to communicate with the market. So I think that's quite good as well because a lot of the discussions that I've got at the moment are with some really really big institutional investors that we're trying to bring in probably more on the equity side than the smarter convert side. But obviously we've got that that capital raising instrument that we can use now. Um but what we're trying to do over the coming weeks and months is to have more institutional investors on our share register because that that gives people confidence as well. Um, you know, we're lucky that we've had people support us to date on the institutional side, but no one's been big enough to be named. Um, and that and that's what we're trying to to to to change because a lot of people say to me, can you name the investors? And and I can't because it's private. They don't need to be disclosed. But that's one of the things that we are able to do with the Toban deal that we announced this morning to, you know, to to tell people the names because, you know, we're all about transparency and and I was pleased to be able to do that.

**Anders:**
(0:06:27) No, it's uh it's excellent and congratulations on that. And um I mean I met Eves uh from Tobam, the founder and CEO down in in in Prague and um they've been been working with Capital B for for quite some time. And I presume it's the same kind of of structure of of Bitcoin bonds that um they're doing for you now. And um I think I want to I want to bring up a question from uh from Christopher uh on the chat. I'll bring it up on the screen just um because he wrote this after you explained it's a it's a win-win. I don't know if if it's possible to just um let me let me read it up for those that are listening. What's the point of effectively borrowing Bitcoin to buy Bitcoin? The convert only makes sense if MNAF goes up, but if that happens, you could just issue equity at that point. But essentially, there's there's it's win-win for you. Um but but please if if you want to answer this one maybe.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:07:25) Yeah, sure. So um you've got a lot of investors out there in the world that believe in Bitcoin like us and what's the only thing that's better than Bitcoin is um compound Bitcoin in my opinion. So you've got these investors and some people with significant amounts of Bitcoin that want a return that's better than Bitcoin. So the way that they can achieve that or or one of the ways they can achieve that is to invest in a well-managed Bitcoin treasury company. Um so that's why you structure it like this. So effectively somebody is investing in you and the benchmark of that investment. All they care about is that their new investment i.e. the you know potential equity is going to perform better than Bitcoin. So that's why the investor does it. Why does the company do it? Well, I can borrow money. I can borrow money from you and you might lend me dollars or I could borrow money from you and you might lend me Bitcoin. So, if you're a smaller company and you're being quite cautious with how you're managing it, you know, obviously everyone knows that we've been, you know, fairly fast-paced on on growing and we're trying our very very best on that. But if you take on that fiat debt when you're smaller like us, um you know, we've only got approximately 200 million pounds worth of Bitcoin and cash in our treasury. So we're not into the billions yet. Um then you as the CEO, I've got to be conscious of repaying that debt if we have a bad year in terms of Bitcoin. So, so that's why it makes sense to take the debt that's denominated in Bitcoin because everything after it in terms of the convert is done in fiat terms. So the share price that these people can convert at is fixed. It's 195 plus 5% which is approximately 2.05. So for the next year they can effectively convert into equity at that price. But if I had taken that $21 million last night, which we announced this morning, if I had taken that in in cash um and done it in equity rather than smarter convert, then I would have done it at 195, so it's 5% more dilution for our shareholders. So, um there isn't really any any downside, you know. Um the the only thing I think you would want to be a little bit careful of which we put in the announcement is from a structural point of view I don't think that you would want you know like a 100% of your treasury exposed to that because what that would mean if you fast forward 12 months is if Bitcoin had a bad year for example it wouldn't convert you give the Bitcoin back the treasury's got nothing in it so I I I have said that approximately 30% of the treasury as a sort of a maximum level should be exposed to that sort of an instrument. Um, you know, in case everything doesn't progress, you know, I believe Bitcoin is going significantly higher in the not too distant future and I believe our share price is going to go on to new highs, you know, this year. Um, but that's just my opinion. You know, I have to structure everything for, you know, more doomy and gloomy scenarios, which which is why we've done it like that. So, um, so yeah, I think it's a pretty good product. I can understand the question, but it's just thinking it through. And that's why in the RNS, we also put a worst case and a best case scenario in there just to try and make it easy for people to understand because whereas I've been thinking about this trying to get it as perfect as I can for weeks, obviously everyone is only seeing this today.

**Anders:**
(0:11:09) Um I uh Can you hear me, Andrew?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:11:15) Yeah. Yeah. I think I so I had I had I think I had um a little technical thing here on my my computer. Um sorry but yeah thank you very much for for that answer. Um so so Tobam have never shorted these stairs shares um that they do um that they work with. Uh and since this is a placement by them it there is not other people in the market that can start shorting because of this right. So that it's like completely off the table basically in practice any shorting.

**Anders:**
(0:11:48) So so with any market you'll always get um smaller investors you know going long going short and things like that. It's quite hard to short a stock on aquis because of the borrow um you know so you will always get a little bit of it but you're not going to get it coming out of the actual investors. And to be fair, you know, in my opinion, you'd be absolutely nuts to short a Bitcoin Treasury stock. Um, because you, you know, if Bitcoin rips or simply that company executes their strategy and raises money at good terms, you're just making life unnecessarily hard for yourself. Um, you'd be much better off shorting something in a different sector. It's probably the worst sector in the world to short. Unless you don't believe in Bitcoin. um then maybe there is an argument for it but then you're probably better off shorting Bitcoin I would suggest um you know um so Tobam are a long only company you know and in in almost 20 years they've never shorted a single stock um so um and also forgetting that point there is no incentive for them to actually short a stock that they've actually done a facility like this with so um you know in terms of them nothing Um, but you know, you might get other people messing around. Um, you know, going short against the stock. You know, that's kind of part of a healthy market. I haven't actually got a problem with anyone that shorts our stock. Um, you know, I' I'd wish them luck. Um, but but, you know, I at the end of the day, they will just contribute to the, you know, the sharp rises when those sharp rises happens. Um, and but if they want to do that, then we're just an an instrument at the end of the day. If people want to short it, no problem.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:13:31) Yeah, would would uh would love to see a short squeeze. That would be uh excellent. So, um you've continued to execute and and stack Bitcoin even through this um sidewards downwards uh market both in Bitcoin and and in treasury companies. Um so that that's awesome to see as as an investor. Um, and the other thing I want to touch upon here is that you've reached top one, top two in Europe, um, where you came um, just above uh, Capital B uh, the previous blockchain group in in France and now they have 25 Bitcoin more than you, but you now have cash that you can buy more Bitcoin with. So, I mean, happy for both of you. You're buying a lot of Bitcoin. Very happy for you that uh, you're living up to the the term faster horse currently. Um so so so how does that feel? You're you're you're knocking um in the top one, top two in Europe.

**Anders:**
(0:14:28) So I've got tremendous respect for Alex from Capital B. Um I've got a reasonable size shareholding in the company. Um and I believe in what they're doing. Um I felt a bit bad actually because I can't remember when it was just over a week ago. I actually went for lunch with him. Um and and I thought I'd get it out the way early in the conversation. And I said, "Well, you know, on paper, um, based on publicly available information, it looks like we've probably got enough cash to, you know, just go past you." So, um, should that happen, I I I just want you to realize that, you know, I've got the utmost respect for you and your company and and I believe in what you're doing. Um, and and he said pretty much the same thing as that back. Um, and, you know, it's great. you know, if we do better, they do better because they're built on the same asset as us. You know, if they do better, you know, if they raise more capital and however they're going to do it, then that's a great thing. It's more capital for Bitcoin. Um, so I've consistently said since the start, you know, I I I want to see other companies doing it well and that I believe in and and you know, they're one of the top couple of companies in the world that I believe in. Um, obviously I'm competitive as well a little bit. Um, you know, I believe that probably by the end of this week, using publicly available information, we'll maybe be past them. I don't know, they might have a mega fund raise that, you know, brings in loads more money than we'll get in the short term. But with everything that I can see at the moment, I think we'll be back in that slot. And I think we might even be a little bit higher. Um, because this sort of 24 25 whatever it is position that we're we're all in at the moment when once you can bust out of that a little bit. So to like I don't know 2,250 2,300 Bitcoin those sorts of levels then the jumps you need to get bigger you know then you need to move hundreds and hundreds at a time um rather than you know 50 Bitcoin or whatever making the difference. So, um, so yeah, I I I I really like them and I've got a lot of respect for what they're doing, but you know, I'm quite looking forward to sort of trying to, you know, get to the next level for ourselves and um, yeah, we'll see how that one goes.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:16:42) Absolutely looking forward to see you both uh, reach 10,000 Bitcoin and then uh, hopefully also 100,000 Bitcoin and and then we see how far you get um, before hyperitronization and then we can't play that game anymore. Um, but then once you have a lot of Bitcoin on your balance sheet, you're essentially potentially running a bank and create can create SATS income with that collateral. Um,

**Anders:**
(0:17:12) that's really interesting thing though, isn't it? It's, you know, at the moment it's a bit of like a land grab, I suppose. Um, you know, and as you say, that won't last forever, you know, maybe three years, five years. I I don't know how long it will last. Um but then you'll see all of these companies changing into whatever they're going to change into. And that'll be a really interesting phase um for all of these companies, you know, the banks of the future um the best capitalized companies in the world. Um to see what they all do with that and how they then move things forward, you know. Um we've got lots of ideas that we talk about all the time of what that could look like. Um we talk about it with some of the other companies as well. Um and and that's going to be a really interesting time. But you know, we're here where we are at the moment, which it's all about speed of execution. Um you know, building that stack, um building a company that's structured in the right way. Um and you know, trying to do it in a respectful way to everyone that chooses to support the company with their with their with their capital.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:18:13) Yeah, absolutely. Um so um it's it's so interesting to see what that endgame is going to look like and um and when it's going to happen. And I I spoke to Jesse last week where I while we were talking came to the conclusion that because there will always be some kind of premium uh to the to the like the MNAP should always be significantly above one. Sure, in a bare market it could go below which could be a creative because then you can sell Bitcoin and buy stock and it'll help the existing shareholders which is which is your job but but because in an endgame there should there will be a premium to the Bitcoin because you can generate an income it removed my fear of or or of of um Bitcoin accumulating companies stalling the engine because you'll always be away from one. you'll not be a one as as long as you're away from one, which you will always be, you can run the engine and stack more SATs. And surely maybe right now when um the stock prices are down on these companies across the board and Bitcoin is flat or down a little bit, maybe the stacking is a little bit slower, but that means you're still growing in size even though Bitcoin is not moving, which means you'll be bigger by the endgame, if that makes sense.

**Anders:**
(0:19:34) Yeah. Don't forget as well that when when we all think about the cost of Bitcoin um you know you can argue that the cost of Bitcoin is is static. It's everything else that's changing. So you know when Bitcoin's 250 500 you know a million whatever dollars. Um you know Bitcoin's kind of the same. It's just the value of the dollars fallen. Um so you know relative because that that's what a currency is at the moment. If you look at pound, dollar, you know, dollar, euro, whatever, they're pairs, you know, so it's just a pair that is, you know, there's a relationship between the two. So, you know, when we when we talk about the potential of Bitcoin companies slowing down, you know, we just have to go back to our own lives and look at when we go to the supermarket and we buy stuff that costs an awful lot more than it did last year because of inflation. Um, you know, that's another dimension that people don't often talk about when they talk about the future prices and how we're going to acquire things. Um, you know, look at the price of your house, for example, you know, relative to what it was 10 years ago or anything like that. You know, it's it's it it's on on on one hand, you're thinking that you're going to buy less Bitcoin, but are you not going to maybe just buy the same at the higher price because the capital is is is is less valuable, i.e. you get more capital which has got the same notional value. Um so it's certainly going to be very very interesting and you know we we've got lots of thoughts and we think about it a lot obviously. Um but yeah, it's um It's it's going to be interesting for sure.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:21:09) Absolutely. Um so also initially here um in the interview you were talking about um the UK institutional investors may be starting to be more interested. You're you're becoming a bigger size a a more of of interest to the really big players in UK. Um so that's the first question. Is this p uh p predominantly UK you're thinking about in terms of institutional investors waking up to SWC?

**Anders:**
(0:21:41) No, it's both actually. So UK and European. Um so I've got a completely full diary at the moment. Um so I think I've got four meetings tomorrow as an example and that's a pretty normal day. Um, so, so they're definitely getting more interested because there's a lot of education that goes on behind the scenes and you know, we're only just getting to that size, you know, 500 million to a billion market cap, that's only just getting big enough for these institutions to want to be interested in in a company, you know, unlike what a lot of people think that you get to like 50 million, 100 million market cap, you know, it's way too small for a credible institution to want to invest. Um so that's one side of things. Um and then I've also got a lot of interest from the states at the moment which is really interesting. Um so we're speaking to um some really really credible people um that raise an awful lot of money um for um you know some companies who will remain nameless because if I say it's you know my hero's company that probably give the game away. Um but um yeah so um so yeah we're trying our best on that front as well. You know I think you know we we've been good with international capital so far um you know in in terms of the the capital raising not just the secondary markets because the secondary markets you know not just the UK, Frankfurt, US. They're all very very important to us. Um, but in terms of that institutional stuff, we've done okay so far, but we are conscious that in addition to these great conversations that we're having with UK and European institutions, we want to be having those conversations and those conversations with the US uh equivalents need to come through. Um, in the states they call them bankers as opposed to brokers. Um, so we're working on that. And then we've got another initiative that we're working on in the states at the moment which I'm not able to talk about just yet. Um, and that's really exciting as well. Um, and that's um, something that by the end of the year I'll be able to talk about. Um, so that's quite cool as well.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:23:45) Wow. By the end of the year, that's that's a long time horizon in um, in this space. So it uh, must be interesting.

**Anders:**
(0:23:52) Yeah. What people um, sort of sometimes need to keep in mind is we all want to see things change and we always try and show people stuff every maybe not every day, but certainly every week. We try our very very best to show people improvement. You know, that the the business is growing and it has grown and, you know, we're way stronger than we were even a month ago as a company, which is ironic when you think that the market cap is probably lower than it was a month ago. Um, and we're a way stronger company than we were a month ago. Um, so there's lots of things that are going on and some of those things you might see, um, you know, in a day, a week, whatever. Um, and then some of those other things you might not see for a month, three months or whatever because some things take longer. So, you know, we we're doing a lot of different things behind the scenes and some of them take as long as they take. You know, we always push it as as hard and as fast as we can, but there's, you know, certain things that mean that things some things just take time. And and that's my job, you know, behind the scenes. you know, people don't see that you're constantly working on these things, you know, on all these different um, you know, things that are going to be done at different times. You know, give you a good example, the smarter convert that um, we announced today. Like we probably started seriously trying to work out how we could do that say three, four weeks ago, something like that, I guess. Um, which which is really quick for something like this. Um so you know things take a bit of time you know we try to get them done as quickly as we can. Sometimes there's certain points at which is right to do certain things. Um but yeah we we try and get things done obviously.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:25:38) Yeah. And and and you certainly do Andrew. Um and and talking about getting things done you now also have Jesse on the team um who was here um on the channel a week ago. So, what does that look like now that um you have him aboard, you have an extra resource to to get things done. Um what does it allow you to do more of? How does he help out? Like he's got some specific uh competences of course and analytical um tools.

**Anders:**
(0:26:05) Yeah. Well, it's amazing working with Jesse. Um, you know, as I said, when we um got him to join the company, um, I spent quite a long time getting to know him because, you know, I was very conscious that it was such an important role to have someone working alongside me doing lots of different things. Um, it's not just that I've been happy with how it's worked out. I've been beyond happy with how he's settled in so far. Um he's currently um you know like to be honest he's been working full-time for the last few weeks anyway but formally migrating into full-time because you know obviously we got to pay him and things like that for for that you know even though he hasn't asked for it um and um and and that's going to be tremendously helpful for the company but you know we're we're we're really trying to build out the team at the moment so um I can't go into specifics other than what people can see from a couple of adverts but they won't see some of the adverts because, you know, they're not the sorts of things you advertise. But we're really trying to build out that team because I want to have the very best people in the world, you know, like we'll never be a massive team. We might end up being like, let's say 15 people um you know, in six months time or something. Um but we're we're really trying to build that out. But Jesse is absolutely fantastic. Um you know, he he's somebody that say for example, I couldn't be in the business for whatever reason, which is certainly not the plan. and I want to do this for 5, 10, 15 years, but he's somebody that I would be absolutely fine with, you know, leaving him to do it. You know, I I I I want people who are better than me. Um and and Jesse is certainly one of those people.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:27:47) That's uh that's excellent. I think um the best managers try to hire people better than themselves, but I think still everyone agrees, Andrew, that um you are if not the goat, the faster horse. Like I I I I can say personally I'm incredibly impressed by your speed of answering emails and like I'm I'm just little me here on the side hooking you up in the in the calendar invites and stuff, but but you are you're you're a beast. Uh you execute, that's for sure.

**Anders:**
(0:28:12) Yeah, I'm on it most of the time. I'm on it. Yeah.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:28:17) Um so I saw one of your uh your your tweets today, so I'm just going to put that on the street on the screen. You are also joining the New York uh NYC on conference September 17th that is put together by Tim Collinsman and uh if anybody want to go that code and 10 gets you 10% on but a lot not on off but but you're also going very happy to see uh that Andy because then I sorry Andrew because then we get to hang out um and I get to say hi to you in person as well finally.

**Anders:**
(0:28:51) Yeah I'm really looking forward to it and Jesse will be there as well. Um, I booked the travel the other day. Um, you know, that's another thing I have to do behind the scenes, sort out all the travel, which takes a bit longer than one might think. Um, but I've actually booked to be there for a couple of extra days. Um, and I've already almost filled all that time with different investment meet investor meetings over there. So, I'm really looking forward to going um to New York. It should be a really good event. Tim's a great guy as well. Um and um yeah, you know, obviously we'll we'll we'll meet each other in person. Um and it should be a lot of fun as well. So if anyone else is, you know, in in New York, then um it's definitely something that that people should should go and attend.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:29:35) Yeah. Um I'm I'm looking forward to it. It's going to it's going to be great. I think uh and Saylor's going to be there. He's going to give a a keynote at 10 a.m., I believe. Um so it's going to be really interesting. So what else that we haven't covered Andrew is happening right now are you working on that you are able to share because I know of course specifics is is is is hard but um in because you're a publicly traded company. Um what what else is um can you say about your thinking of the current environment and which tools to use etc.

**Anders:**
(0:30:04) Yeah. So, um, in terms of our operating business, which no one, um, talks about in that much detail, you know, that's actually going quite well at the moment. Um, I'm really pleased with the progress that we're making on that. Not allowed to talk about the numbers, but normally it'd be quite quiet in the summer. Um, and it's actually busier than it should than it normally would be, but that's only a small business despite the fact that we're trying to grow it. So, we're trying to build out that team a little bit as well. Um, so, so you know, I don't know, three, six, nine, 12 months time, that should, you know, start to make a bit more of a difference, um, to the business because even though no one's that interested in it, you know, I I care about it and it's got the obvious benefit of the more money that makes, the more it covers the PLC costs, um, which is, you know, obviously important. Um, so that's quite good. Um, we were really pleased to be able to announce the smarter convert because we've got our ATM running. Um, we've got our smarter convert now. So, that's another option when we're speaking to investors. We can talk about, you know, the equity style or the smarter convert because different people want different things. Um I am I'm quite looking forward to um sort of the next couple of weeks, you know, getting out the way. Um you know, because we we've got things that we're doing and we're very very busy, but the the market is always a bit quieter over the summer. I don't really understand why it always works like this that, you know, when the market's quieter, you know, people don't take advantage of the opportunity and then, you know, you get into like September, you know, everything rips. people pile in then I don't really understand why people don't just sort of you know buy like two three weeks before um but you know there you go um so um and then when we when we get into September um well actually before we get into September I'm going to Hong Kong so that's for the Bitcoin conference in in Hong Kong that should be really good um and then obviously we get into September and then it just goes absolutely berserk you know so I've got those couple of days in New York um there's a Bitcoin event in uh on the Saturday when I get back. So, I've got to go straight there from the airport the week before, the week after. There's another two Bitcoin events on the Friday nights in the UK. Um and then there's a conference that's just been announced which is on one of those Fridays as well. That's in London at the Mansion House. That should be quite good as well. Um, so there's so much stuff going on at the moment and like I get a lot of messages from, you know, friends, investors and things and, you know, a lot of people are saying that it's quiet at the moment and it is quiet in terms of the market. Um, but in terms of what we're doing, it's absolutely crazy. Um, you know, it's busier than it's ever been. Um, you know, every month it gets like that, busier than the previous month. So, um, that gives me a lot of confidence, you see. Um because as an investor myself in our company and other Bitcoin treasury companies in Bitcoin itself, you know, you know, I'm not in the slightest bit worried about um you know what it's going to do over the next few months, you know, and maybe that's dangerous. Maybe I believe so much that we're going higher that maybe that's blinding it. But that's my opinion again and you know, I'm entitled to that. But seeing what I'm seeing and with the conversations that I'm having is more exciting than ever. just the company, the general sector. Um, so yeah, I'm pretty looking forward to that. Um, and then I've I've even got um quite a bit of the diary filling up thereafter, you know, um right up to the end of the year. I've even got some things in there for next year, which is pretty unheard of for me, you know, because I'm not normally that organized, but um but yeah, it's pretty good at the moment actually on the whole.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:34:00) So, so when you're I I I I too believe that um Bitcoin is going to go higher and uh but but what differs you a little bit from some other companies is you're still keeping some cash. So even if Bitcoin does go down, that would play to your advantage because then cash you have on the balance sheet can be converted or to Bitcoin.

**Anders:**
(0:34:24) Yeah, it sort of would and it wouldn't, I suppose. Um, so we we do normally keep a little bit of cash. Um, but so Sailor put out a slide earlier showing their cash relative to their Bitcoin. Uh, they've got $50 million that they keep in cash. Um, which, you know, not a lot of people know that, but clearly they're a much bigger business, so they need some working capital. Um, but as a percentage versus the Bitcoin holding, it's it's tiny. Um so you know we whereas in the early days the first month or two um we were spreading out the purchase say over two weeks um you know as we built it up which you know looking back at history I think everyone agrees was probably the right strategy. It's a bit different now in the sense that you know whereas it was two weeks before it might be you know I'm not going to say the exact time but let's call it half a week now. Um, but we still keep a tiny bit of cash back in in in the treasury for a variety of reasons. One of the reasons might be that it just makes more sense because we're doing round numbers now to the nearest 10, you know. So, when we did the buy that we announced the other day, I think we kept £500,000 back. Um, you know, and that wasn't for any massive reason. away from the treasury, we actually keep, you know, probably more money than most companies, you know, in the UK would keep for our working capital, which is getting topped up by the operating income as well, um, all the time. So, we keep that separate. Um, when we disclose the numbers of the cash that we're keeping in the treasury, that is excluding the wider cash position of the company. Um, so we, you know, we obviously have to juggle that as we see fit. Sometimes when we raise money, we take nothing out of it. Sometimes we might take a few hundred,000 pounds out of it, you know, for that side of things. Um, you know, I don't think we've ever actually taken a few hundred,000 pounds out of it, but hypothetically speaking. Um, obviously the commission has to come out of it. Um, so yeah, we're, you know, everything's going pretty well. I I don't think I think maybe when we get say don't hold me to this to like 5,000 Bitcoin we'll probably lose the cash figure in the treasury that that we disclose because it will be so meaningless at that point. Um you know if we're keeping back you know one two million or something like that. It's meaningless relative to the size of the Bitcoin because our treasury is approximately 200 million pounds at the moment. So, you know, yes, we could buy a bit more Bitcoin, slightly cheaper, but our philosophy is that we're short the pound, long Bitcoin. So, you know, the the cash being held back isn't so much for a rainy day. Because I've always said that the worst thing that you can do when you're running a Bitcoin treasury company after the first couple of months is to not deploy the cash in case Bitcoin rips. If Bitcoin dips, everyone understands that because your belief is that Bitcoin is is where you want to hold it and you ride out those dips. Um, but I think it's almost inexcusable if Bitcoin rips and you haven't got a reason why you haven't deployed the majority of the cash. So, um, you know, that's that's that's probably a longer answer than you wanted, but there you go.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:37:39) No, and Andrew, uh, me and everyone watching wants to hear you talk, so very happy with that. Thank you. You also mentioned that um you see an uptick in your current business and I remember Sailor was talking about how the fact that they've become a treasury company and all the attention that gave um was a great marketing really for for their business is is that what you're experiencing as well in in in you guys making websites for companies and here I applaud for that.

**Anders:**
(0:38:11) Yeah. So, if you think about it, um it's approximately three and a half months since we listed and the the first couple of months went better than I was expecting on the PLC side, you know, hence the capital, the Bitcoin stack, etc., etc., you know, tremendously pleased with that. On the operating business, I kind of expected that to get a bit more of an uptick quicker. Um, and I think whilst I can't talk about the numbers, I think we're only starting to see the benefit of that now. Um, because when people inquire about buying a website, they might find you and then they might get in touch two months later. It takes a bit of time. Um, so I I think for me with the benefit of the first couple of months of data, I'll look back at the first whole year and I'll see whether that was, you know, justifiably better through having that increased visibility. um as being a public company. Um so when we did our admission document which is our prospectus, we did say that the increased v visibility of being a public company would assist the operating business in its marketing efforts. Um so I think when we get to the end of that first year, we'll see that. Um and then we'll also see the um so we're recruiting a marketing manager at the moment. um or it might end up being a sort of a just below a marketing manager because you know we've had some really good candidates that haven't quite fit that profile. Um so what whatever it ends up being you know these additional marketing things that we wouldn't have done which we've been able to do because of being a PLC. Um and I think it's moderately exciting that side of things. Um, you know, and the great thing about what we do as an operating business, like a lot of online uh businesses or or or businesses that generate most of their activity through online, it's so easy to track everything, all the key points that have triggered the various different events. So, you know, like we can see where all of our business comes from, you know, existing clients, Google, pay-per-click, you know, SEO, whatever. Um, and and and we can then say what's working and what isn't working. do more of what's working, less of what isn't working. Um, and that side of things. So, um, so yeah, the the short version is it's it's starting to make a difference, but, um, that side of things is taking a little bit longer than I expected. Um, whereas the PLC side of things has gone a little bit quicker than I expected.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:40:33) Right. Excellent. Um, and, uh, please note that I'm not, um, at all putting myself, uh, you know, applying for this job. you have marketing but the the funny thing is 20 years ago I was working uh doing uh online marketing for a a a website company however this was a you know on the low price all modules and everything you know you have to do it yourself kind of thing so it's a volume marketing kind of thing where you guys do bespoke websites right

**Anders:**
(0:41:12) yeah but we we do it um not that differently to that so it's very affordable um you know you're talking a couple 000 to have a bespoke website designed for you. So, it's very modular and it's it's kind of like what you were doing but with a bespoke service on top of it. So, you don't The beauty of the service is you don't have to do it all yourself, but you don't you're not paying any expensive agency and you're getting a similar um sort of end product. Um but yeah, if there's anyone out there that's interested, um because what we might end up doing for this particular role is we might end up finding somebody that say studied marketing, really passionate about it, maybe he's got a year or two experience in it, but is really keen to, you know, to to to progress their career. And we might accept that then we can train that person up, you know, because we've had a couple of good candidates that are more experienced. Um but a lot of the people that are more experienced haven't been so good. So um you know we're pretty flexible on that. So you know if you know of anyone that or if there's anyone watching that wants to get in touch and put themselves forward for that um you know that would be um you know that's a really good opportunity for people you know and and um and we're pretty flexible on on on that side of things as well.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:42:33) Yeah. Um, so I've been way out of that game for for a very long time. But I remember back then Google search, um, banner advertising, affiliate, uh, that was that was, you know, all the main most important kind of advertising tools, but that's not why people are here to hear more about your marketing. But it's interesting and if anyone's out there, you know, get get hold of Andrew and help them sell more websites. That would be awesome. So, with the current MNAV that is a little bit lower than it was two months ago when we first spoke, um how hard are you still able to hit the the equity issuance in terms of continuing to raise funds? I mean, it's still quite accreative uh when you do so in terms of generating more Bitcoin per stock, but so how how hard is um the pedal hitting the metal um with the current MNAF, so to speak?

**Anders:**
(0:43:25) Yeah. So, So I I'll be honest and transparent like I always am, you know. Um, so on my calculations, the current MNAV is 2.7. Um, so what I'm doing to calculate that is I'm taking a diluted number of shares in issue. So I'm taking the shares in issue and then I'm adding on the potential shares in issue from Smarter Convert and then I'm not adding in the warrants which will will come into play in say eight months. Um, we've got a plan on those as well. everyone will be pleased to hear. Um so um so so that's a pretty accurate figure for for the MNAV 2.7 um at the current share price. Now clearly raising money at 2.7 MNAV for a Bitcoin treasury company is beneficial because you are improving the Bitcoin per share for the shareholders. It's as simple as that. Um especially if you do it as we do it where I do not believe in discounts. Um, if the market is discounting our stock, which we've all, well, not me because I'm not selling the shares, but but but everyone that's trading on the market has got a a a responsibility for setting that price. If the market's discounting our share price like it does at the moment or in my opinion to 195 or whatever it is, um, then that's different. But I will not discount the share price um, when raising capital um, you know, because I don't need to at the end of the day. Um, and I don't think it's right. Um so um so in in short from a uh a mathematical point of view you can raise money all day long at this price and it's beneficial to the shareholders because you're improving the Bitcoin per share. So everyone that understands that should see that over the long term that's a good thing to do. Now there's a slight complexity in this though which is let's say the share price dipped a bit more. um what do want what do people want me to do because I've got two options there. One is I can not raise money for a period of time. The second one is I can raise money improve the Bitcoin per share um and and dilute people but it's still beneficial because you're improving the Bitcoin per share. So I wouldn't want to say exactly what we'll do let's say for the next week, two weeks on that front. Um because you know what hopefully what everyone's seen today is that we do things at the right time or or when we think they're the right time. Um but purely from a math point of view raising money at 2.7 ml is beneficial to to the company. I don't think for a smaller Bitcoin treasury company I don't think say it went below two which I don't think it's going to do um at all. Um I don't I don't I don't think it's necessarily the right thing to do. Maybe two and a half um you know but but but the the job is to to you know from a treasury point of view to increase the Bitcoin per share. Um and um you know that's something that that is is is um is is important. My personal opinion is that we'll probably bumble around at this sort of price. Can't see it going that much lower. maybe go to like 250 or something like that over the next week or two. Um I'm obviously not meant to talk about these price things. This is my opinion, not a projection. Right. Right. Right. Right. But I I don't know when it will happen, whether it'll be a week, two weeks, whatever. At some point, bit before, bit after September, assuming Bitcoin's on the trajectory that I think it'll be on, then we'll be back up again. And and everyone will be saying the same thing that they always say, which is, "Why the hell didn't I load up when it was a 2.7 mnaV?"

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:47:13) Um, yeah. Yeah. And I I just want to make everyone uh aware if if if there's some that don't know, but if you go to investors.smarter webc company.co.uk/analytics, UK/analytics you'll find this web uh or this page that uh that Andrew and his team has put together where you can see all these uh key numbers like uh the share price how many bitcoin a whole development and share price um bitcoin hell the nav uh and the mnav and and I I completely agree with you here Andrew it's uh Andrew it's it's still 2 um8 let me just remove it. Get us back on. It's still um according to your website 2.83 which is highly accreative. So there's still enough um steam on the engine that running it at at at this level does uh allow you to increase Bitcoin uh quite significantly per share from my perspective. Um yeah,

**Anders:**
(0:48:13) what we do as well is on so on our ATM style facility, we never sell on a down day. Um, so lots of people have said that you could structure it in a different way. I believe that how we've structured it is right. Um, I don't think people want us selling on a down day. Um, uh, you know, you could do that. You could structure it on MNAV instead of up and down days and things, but you know, um, you know, we're really happy with how the ATM staff facility has worked to date. Um and and I think it's structured in in in the right way and and I agree with you, it is beneficial um to to shareholders, existing shareholders um raising money at at um you know that sort of an MNAV, you know.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:48:59) No, absolutely. And I'm looking forward to be able to still see, you know, Bitcoin purchases uh from you guys and and pushing the Bitcoin per stock higher because we're still at that level. So that's um that is very good from a an investor point of view. So Johannes here uh whom I know he's a Danish Bitcoiner has a question uh for you that I want to throw up. Any worries about regular regulatory push backs from the government in the UK?

**Anders:**
(0:49:30) Yeah. So in simple no um you know we we do everything that's asked of us um and more. Um, we've we've not had a single um concern raised about how we're running the business. Um, so I'm I'm pretty relaxed about it. Um, if the question is, am I concerned about what the government's doing away from our company, then yes, very much so. Um, but that only strengthens my belief in what we're doing as a company. Um, so, you know, I I I don't have any concerns. I've not been made aware of any concerns or anything like that um about, you know, what we're doing. I I would hope um that the the regulators and and those sorts of people like to see a positive story coming out of the UK. Um um so yeah, it's it's quite a simple one that answer.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:50:19) So I'm going to try and ask in a way where well for sure answer in a way where where you don't get in trouble but is there currently some level of push back on Bitcoin in in general outside the stock market in in the

**Anders:**
(0:50:38) what I mean um and I shouldn't criticize the government because that always gets you in in trouble but I just meant more in the wider sort of you know I'm not a political person um at all um but I just mean in the wider thing you know, the fact that they're not looking after the country for the benefit of, you know, our children and things like that. You know, maybe they're not doing a good job from a tax point of view. Um maybe they're not doing a good job of spending the public's money properly. All those sorts of things. You know, the sort of things that people moan about all the time and nothing to do with point. Um to be fair to the government, um from a Bitcoin point of view, they're more positive than they've been for many, many years. Um, so whilst we can all moan about them, I'm sure it's a harder job than than we all think potentially. Yeah. But but but from a Bitcoin point of view, they're actually being quite positive at the moment. So maybe we have to give them a bit of credit for that.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:51:32) Apart from trying to sell the Bitcoin, did you see that story that came out the other day?

**Anders:**
(0:51:39) Tell me.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:51:47) Oh, so there was a thing in one of the papers which said um the chancellor was um thinking about um um selling our Bitcoin, you know, the five billion or whatever it might be seven billion, I'm not sure how much it is of Bitcoin that the UK government effectively holds. Um you know, I don't think that was a very good thing.

**Anders:**
(0:52:06) Uh that is very sad for for the inhabitants uh citizens of of UK if that that's that's the case.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:52:13) Yeah. I hope they don't do that. But we've seen it in Germany. Germany had 50,000 bitcoins, sold them all for money that they can just print it. It's um

**Anders:**
(0:52:21) that's the same thing that I said to my friend. I said they should be doing the opposite. At the end of the day, they control the printer. Um you know, like it's a no-brainer, isn't it? Um yeah. No. Um, but you know, it is what it is, I suppose. Um, I I'm not as bullish actually as most people are about state adoption of of of Bitcoin. Like obviously I would welcome it. I see it as a great thing, but you know, if it happens, it happens. If it doesn't happen, it doesn't make any difference to me in in my opinion. Um, you know, I don't want people to take that the wrong way. But, you know, I I'm I'm quite relaxed about that side of things. And you know, you've got an obvious conflict there between the people that have got their own currency, like the UK has got the pound, the Americans have got the dollar, um, and, you know, effectively Bitcoin. Um, so I I'm quite relaxed about that side of things as well. But what I don't think is acceptable is, um, for the UK government to sell the Bitcoin when they could be keeping it for the benefit of our children.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:53:13) Absolutely. Uh Andrew, any update on the timeline for preferred stock? Any speculation that you can share in terms of when is it technically and collaterally wise u possible?

**Anders:**
(0:53:29) Um yeah, so the beauty of um having other great companies like strategy and metaplanet is that you can see what they've done and when they've done it and how that's worked and things like that. Um, if you look at MetaPlanet, their stack is approximately what, nine times as big as ours, something like that. Um, so maybe that's the benchmark. Um, I've I've I've I've I've always said that it's something that we'd like to do longer term. Um, when we're an appropriate size, um, there's quite significant costs to offering preference shares because it's a bit like a mini IPO. Um, uh, you need liquidity for things like that as well. Um, I I I like the smarter convert product that we um have publicly come out with today. Um, because I think that's quite a good stepping stone towards that. Um, I I think that there's reasons not to do traditional convertible things as well, very good reasons not to do those. Um, so I think it's quite a good thing as we get bigger. Um I I don't know whether you know the value of our treasury needs to be 500 million pounds, a billion pounds, two billion pounds. Probably doesn't need to be any bigger than that. Um so I don't really know. Um I think it would be um something if if you really pushed me on it um I'd probably say if I was guessing a year from now um to have it live, you know, not you know because it would take months to get that thing there. you know, we've had lots of discussions about it already. Um, you know, including with, you know, the advisers, the brokers, the lawyers, etc. Um, so, um, you know, the reality is, um, as much as people might not want to hear it, is is the size that we are at the moment, it doesn't make economic sense to do that. Um, I think maybe a little bit smaller than Meta Planet, it would make economic sense to do that. Um, gotcha. So, you know, it's stepping stones, isn't it? It's the evolution of what we're doing. Um, maybe one of the things that you'll see is whereas, you know, take MetaPlanet for example. Let's say they get them done by the end of this year, which will be approximately 18 months from them changing their strategy, which was April 2024. Um, so, you know, that's 18 months. So, they got from zero to a,000 Bitcoin in six months. We did it in two months. Um, so maybe it will take us a year, maybe something like that. Um, which would be April next year. I'm not saying that's when it's going to happen. I'm just saying maybe for the companies that come up, um, behind the other companies that do it so well, the time scales maybe get shorter for most things. So, um, I don't think it will take that long um, until people see that, you know, but um, is it going to be tomorrow? No, it's not going to be tomorrow.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:56:29) Um and and and that leads me to the next question. Uh any news or speculation on uplisting to the it's called the London Stock Exchange, right? The LCE LSE.

**Anders:**
(0:56:42) The LSE. Yeah. Um so, um I probably can't say anything that I haven't already said on that in the sense that um you know, we are um focused on being one of the biggest companies in the UK. Um, we are the biggest holder of Bitcoin in in the UK, public company holding Bitcoin in the UK. Um, I I would like us to be say in the top um, you know, quarter or so of the Footsie 100 within a year, two years, that sort of a thing. That that means that we've got to be a 40 billion pound market cap. Not sure whether we can be a 40 billion pound market cap on Aquis. Um so um you know I'm not in a position where I'm allowed to say at what stage the process is at. Um but maybe we just say that you know we're trying to do everything as as quickly as we can and um we believe that we're doing things in the right order at the right time for the benefit of where we want to be. Um and as soon as we can say anything different um where we are with that process, we'll we'll say.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:57:48) All right. So I have two things left because I can see we're actually nearing uh 6 p.m. in in UK. Two things is uh one there was a question in the chat uh what SWC's bare market BDC potential BDC bare market strategy would be. The other thing I want to say is so with your your current um MNAV share price that puts your market cap around 6,000 Bitcoin. That that's how I like to analyze and evaluate um companies like yours yet you have a target of reaching um more than 100,000 Bitcoin. Is is it actually 1%? Is it 210,000 Bitcoin?

**Anders:**
(0:58:33) Right.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:58:40) So so that's a quite a quite a steep discount. um to where where SWC potentially could go um and and that's a return in Bitcoin. So that's I think very exciting. But if you have any comments on that and then the S SWC if if you have a bare market strategy and then I want to also you know say thank you for your time and I know it's about up.

**Anders:**
(0:58:58) Sure. So um in terms of the targets and things like that you know we all that we ever say is that we want to do better every day, week, month, etc. Um, you know, I'll be quite disappointed if we're not, um, holding a multiple of what we're holding today before the end of the year. Um, you know, I don't mean double there either, by the way. Um, so, you know, a multiple. Um, I won't say the exact number that I've got in my mind, but, um, but yeah, so so we we'd be basically past your 6,000 thing by a margin, which would be good. Um, so, you know, are we valued at fairly at the moment? Well, I think we're actually undervalued at 2.7 uh MNAV. Um but um but you know, I can see it from a variety of different arguments that in terms of a bare market, that side of things. Now, um ironically, if you're in a bare market, so yes, it's harder to raise capital, but it's a lot easier to buy Bitcoin because Bitcoin will be cheaper based on wherever it starts. Now I think people need to also understand that if we do get a bare market, it depends what's happened before. So say for example, we go to 300,000 and then we have a 50% correction to 150,000 Bitcoin, then you know how long is that correction going to be as well? Because you know like everything um whatever you're looking at things get more concentrated. They speed up over time almost everything. Um and and so you know those bare markets are they going to be shorter, you know, longer, etc., etc. Um are they going to even happen at all? Um you know, I I'm I wouldn't bet my life on it, but I'm pretty confident that those sorts of bare markets that we've seen in the past are going to be very different in the future. Um so, so what you have to remember is that capital is going to be harder to raise in a bare market. debt is potentially going to be cheaper. Um, so if we all think back to 20 years ago, for example, you borrow as much money as you want for pretty much 0%. You know, nowadays it's I don't know what it is to borrow money, but I imagine it's 5 to 10% dependent on how much, who you are, etc., maybe 4% in the UK. Um, so, you know, obviously more expensive than 0%. Um, but there's all sorts of things that you can do in those sorts of scenarios. So you've got the irony in the sense that um it's probably easier to grow the Bitcoin per share in a way providing you're not trading at a discount. Um um the good thing that we've got as well is we've got an operating business that is um you know all being well growing. Um so it's not like we're relying on external capital to keep the the PLC intact. Um because the last thing that we'd ever want to do um and I don't think we would ever need to do this um would be to ever touch any of our Bitcoin, you know. Um because you know the whole idea is that you hold it forever um for the benefit of the business. Um so so yeah, we we we talk about those scenarios a lot. Um and that's one of the reasons why not being overleveraged is quite important. Um so if you look at the structure of smart convert for example worst case scenario you have to return the bitcoin um I you've not exposed yourself to a traditional fiat debt type thing there's literally no cost of servicing that debt um so so yeah we we think about it and we just make sure that the business is structured in a right way you know for for the long term you know that's what I care about of course I care about the short term but I'm very focused and all of my actions are based on the medium to long term

**Andrew Webley:**
(1:02:34) All right. Um, excellent answer, Andrew. As as all of them, I enjoy my my time here with you.

**Anders:**
(1:03:00) I just want to thank everyone for their support as as as I always like to do. you know, we we're trying our best. You know, if you look at this week, you know, we've announced some funding through equity on the Monday, the smart to convert today, and I think everyone's probably expecting a Bitcoin buy in the not too distant future. You know, me too. Um and um you know, we're we're trying our best. Um we believe that the company's a lot stronger than it was, you know, a month ago. Certainly way stronger than it was two months ago. Um, you know, we're only just getting started on the journey and and we're very very excited, a lot more excited than I was a few weeks ago about, you know, the the the immediate and then the slightly longer term future. But, you know, the support of everyone means so much to me. Um, and, you know, all I can do is my best to make sure that me and the rest of the team execute the strategy as you all um, I believe hope that we will do.
