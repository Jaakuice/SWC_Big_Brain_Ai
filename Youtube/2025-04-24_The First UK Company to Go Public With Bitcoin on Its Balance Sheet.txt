**Host:**
(0:00:00) Taking a UK Company Public with Bitcoin businesses, they make lots of money in lots of different ways. And you know, for us, for the future, you know, that's that's why we believe in Bitcoin and because we think it's the very very best asset that the world's ever seen. So, would we prefer to hold our spare cash in pounds or in, you know, this investment, that investment? You know, it's um, you know, it's picking the commodity that we believe in the very, very most um, and aligning ourselves with that for the long term. Andrew, thank you very much for joining me. It must be a yeah, a whirlwind of a week for you. Um, as we come up Well, this this episode will be going out um as your company goes public. Did did you ever like let's rewind a little bit like when you started Smarter Web um back in 2009 did you ever imagine that this day would actually come?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:01:15) Yeah. So it's been a very busy week um well busy four months actually. um a sort of no is the short answer but when I set up the smarter web company I had left a company called Hargreaves Lansdown and and I worked there for 10 years and probably four years before I left HL we listed that on the stock market so I've been through the process before you know I'm very grateful of going through that process as well because you know I was a smaller shareholder there um so when I set up my business. I I had visions of how we could grow it and we've been, you know, fairly successful with that. You know, it's very profitable, reoccurring revenue, good number of websites, all the clients like us, all this sort of stuff. Um, so I thought we could make it successful, but I I don't think I ever thought that it would be a business that would list on a stock market. So, you know, fast forwarding, you know, 15 years after setting it up, it's it's well, it's really cool, but it's it's it's quite surreal um in in that regard. That said, you know, um you know, I do think that we've got all the elements right. We've got a great team. We've got a good strategy. You know, we're established because, you know, the business has been trading for 15 years. So you know when I look at a lot of smaller companies to me it seems you know quite exciting you know as an investor not as the CEO um but you know arguably you know if you believe in digital assets technology web design and so forth um you know not as risky as a lot of opportunities so um yeah it's it's pretty cool it's uh

**Host:**
(0:03:20) as I was like forming the questions I was I was looking and like doing a little digging and obviously I found that it was founded in 2009 and I was like that's quite fitting um that you founded your company 2009 and Bitcoin was also started in 2009.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:03:35) Yeah. I've got another good one for you actually on that regard. So everyone thinks that the birthday of the guy that invented Bitcoin so say um is the 5th of April um that's deemed you know to us Bitcoiners that's deemed to be the date. Um and my birthday is the 5th of April as well. So, um, there you go.

**Host:**
(0:03:50) Oh, wow. That is cool. Hey, it's also the the last day of the tax year as well.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:03:55) Yeah. Oh, wow. Yeah, that's everything's aligning. It's like everything on this journey so far, this last four months, you know, everything seems to have aligned quite nicely. And, you know, may maybe that tells you that everything's going to be okay. You know, I'm a big believer in fate. You know, doing good, then good things will happen to you and all that sort of stuff. And, you know, there's even in that little thing that we've just talked about there, there's a few things aligning, aren't there?

**Host:**
(0:04:20) Yeah. And it's such a and I think a lot of people listening um when this goes out will be feeling that it's such a nice feeling to have a UK company um actually adopting a Bitcoin strategy and going public with it. And it's because everyone's been looking at strategy and other companies out with I've had quite a few of them on the podcast and chatting. Um, but how you talked a little bit about the process there of getting to this point. I can imagine it's been quite a roller coaster um to to actually getting to where we are today um over the last four four months as you said.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:04:55) Yeah. So um you know I first invested in strategy you know formerly micro micro strategy you know four years ago and um you know obviously I've been investing for 25 years um you know because I started at HL investment company get interested in it and and all the rest of it. Um it's been um yeah it's been challenging the last few months in terms of making sure you've got all the elements right in your strategy. um you know but um you know we've just worked through all the things you know there's been some bumps you know um you know things have happened like the you know the the global markets becoming quite unsettled three weeks ago whenever it was um you know these sorts of things you know you can't control them at the end of the day um but if you zoom out and look at the long term of you know anything you know that you believe in um you know you just have to keep grinding away through the day you know what whatever you're doing. So, um, you know, it's definitely been been challenging. You know, a business like ours, you know, when we're public isn't really any different to when we're private, just on on a bigger scale, um, with with me not owning 100% and and multiple shareholders, I public company. So, you know, there's lots of businesses out there that believe in in in using certain assets for their capital, you know, whether that's gold, uh, property, um, you know, just equities, you know, whatever really, you know, other businesses. Um, it's just that, you know, we believe as a business that digital assets are where you should, um, you know, be be holding your excess capital. So, you know, in some ways it's not doing that much different to what we've done previously, but you know, just on a bigger scale and obviously when you're a public company, then you've got other strategies for growth. So, for example, you're more visible. um you know more interesting if that's the right word you know so it can help you grow that and and and obviously there's different ways that you can then raise capital you know so a private company you can go to your bank and you can say I want to borrow some money and they'll screw you on the interest rate and all of that whereas when you're a public company if if people believe in you you know they can invest in equity or obviously more complicated things in the future like the AKA strategy so you know there's there's There's lots of different things that have been challenging over the last few months, but we believe we've got a very good strategy in place. Um, we're very excited about the future, you know, with our core operating business and our treasury strategy. Um, and yeah, we're very much looking forward to it.

**Host:**
(0:07:30) Uh, for for people that don't know, um, because like I've been this is big news in Bitcoin world and especially in the UK. Um, so I've been telling a lot of people about this, but can you just like summarize what is the core business model? Um, and then we'll dive into the, uh, Bitcoin treasury strategy.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:07:50) So, the Smarter Web Company designs and builds websites for people. Um, but we do it in a different way to a traditional agency. Um so when I set up the business I wanted to build a content management system that I felt was one of the best content management systems in the world. Um so the whole business has been built around the system. You know the processes that we use to support our clients, how we sign people up, you know how we host the websites, literally everything is built around the system. Um so what that means to the client is that they get a professionally designed website at an affordable price. Uh what it means for us is that we can handle that business efficiently. We've got a good process to guide them through right from the start to going live. But then also once they're live, they can content manage the website. So basically change the text, images, ad pages, etc. Um we've got some clients that you do very little and we've got other clients that do loads and loads of things every single day with the system. It's entirely up to them. And then also from a business point of view, um it means that we get reoccurring revenue. Um so about 30% of our revenue is reoccurring. Um so people pay us basically like a hosting provider. So um so it's quite a good business model in that regard. We've got a large number of small clients rather than a small number of h of large clients. Um so so we do that and then in addition to that that's the sort of the core part of the core business. Um we also do other things like we're really good at SEO. we can help people with, you know, custom development projects and these things. So, um, you know, we've got 250 plus clients. Um, you know, they're they're in the most part very very happy, very loyal, very supportive and and we we offer them a genuinely a very very good service, you know. So, if people phone up, we pick up the phone within a couple of rings. If they email out of ours, we get back to them. So, you know, like nowadays, without wanting to sound like an old man, you know, where you don't always get the service that you expect, we try really hard on that side of things. Um, you know, and I'm I'm ever so proud of it. And funnily enough with what we're going to talk about in a bit with the treasury management, it almost unlocks capital to grow the core business that wouldn't be there without that other side of things. And you know obviously when you've got multiple aspects to what you do as a business yes it's harder for someone to understand but if you look at most businesses so for example Amazon's a good example started life as a bookshop then became you know basically a platform for selling everything not even their own stuff because most of it is in their warehouse owned by other people delivered but then you've got all the other services that they do you know like Amazon music Amazon TV you know all of these things so it's not actually that uncommon to have multiple elements within a business, you know, trying to deliver that value for for whoever owns that business. In our case, the the shareholders.

**Host:**
(0:11:20) Yeah. When you're talking about that, it reminds me of I did a presentation last year at some point and I was trying to explain Micro Strategy at the time. Um, I was trying to explain to people what was actually happening there and I used McDonald's as the example because it's such a great one to to look at because they've got almost a dual strategy of you've got your core business of burgers and chips, let's just say, and then you've got also got McDonald's is a real estate company and they've got I think it's about 45 billion ion um worth of property on their balance sheet. I was looking at um all of their accounts last year. And yeah, when you explain this that if you want your company to last centuries, not decades, then you need to be holding an asset that is going to last the leng that length. um and essentially building a a financial moat around your core product or your castle.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:12:05) Yeah, you're 100% right. But you you can look at businesses in all different spaces. So, you know, my one of my favorite examples, not that I know masses about them, but is, you know, the house builders, you know, those house builders, you know, sort of taking the way that they operate to one side because, you know, there's some issues there as well in terms of how they restrict the supply. But in, you know, they they buy land, they sit on that land for a long period of time, you know, 10, 20, 30 years before then developing that land. Um, and then also, how do they use their cash? do they use that? You know, I wouldn't do it like that personally, but as I understand it, they make an awful lot of money off not paying suppliers. And so, effectively, they're doing a treasury management business using, you know, a different asset, i.e. cash and land. Um, so it's exactly the same as McDonald's. And there's loads of businesses out there. You know, people, they think, you know, this business sells this, but then there's loads of other elements. You know, take my old company, Hargreaves Lansdown, you know, the biggest investment provider in the UK. You know, they make an awful lot of money off cash or off converting cash from dollars to pounds, pounds to dollars, you know, that side of things. You know, when people are buying and selling shares, it's a bit of a ripoff actually in all honesty. Um, but you know the you know businesses they make lots of money in lots of different ways and you know for us for the future you know that's that's why we believe in Bitcoin and because we think it's the very very best asset that the world's ever seen. So you know would we prefer to hold our spare cash in pounds or in you know this investment that investment you know it's um you know it's picking the commodity that we believe in the very very most um and aligning ourselves with that for the long term. So it isn't as different as people think you know and the McDonald's example is a great one because we all like McDonald's.

**Host:**
(0:13:50) Yeah. And a lot of people don't realize that as well. they just see the the front-facing stuff um rather than actually what's happening behind the scenes. Um and speaking of that, let's talk a little bit about that. So, when did Bitcoin come into the picture for your company? Um when did you start integrating? Because I can see that you can pay in Bitcoin as well. Um yeah, when did you start thinking about Bitcoin within your company?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:14:15) Yeah. So, um, so I, you know, I'll be completely honest with you here. Um, I've been interested in Bitcoin for almost 10 years now. Um, 2017, I think, was when I bought my first bit of Bitcoin. Um, and but as a company, I wanted to be more vocal about it, but I was a bit scared in all honesty, um, about how people that didn't understand it would think if we aligned ourselves with it because when you provide a service to, you know, small to mediumsiz businesses was what we we do. You don't really want to introduce things that are going to scare them. Um and then we got to about 22 23 something like that. Um and you know I was desperate. I was thinking well you know like you know people can pay us you know for example in in Bitcoin we can hold that you know and and and that's much better. It's actually not only better the money but it's also better for international people because it's quicker less fees etc. Um and and we got to that point so what's that two years ago something like that. Um, and I just thought, well, you know, whatever. I'm going to do that. So, I I I haven't ever had any bad backlash from it. Um, maybe I waited too long to to offer that. Um, you know, as a very visible thing on our website. Part of me wanted to do my own small little bit to, you know, support Bitcoin and to say, look, this is another thing to a lot of people that probably wouldn't see it. Um, so in the grander scale of things, it's not that long, two years. Um, but you know, it's it's something that, you know, obviously if we could all turn the clock back, we'd do many different things. Um, but you know, maybe we could have done it a little bit sooner if we were braver.

**Host:**
(0:16:10) Yeah. And you're right, it's I I remember like the narrative um was very different um a few years ago. It's it's changed completely with uh like the ETFs coming in America, Strategy doing what they're doing. Um and it just feels like it's a different landscape to what it was a couple years ago. Um so is for sure, you know, like nobody can argue in the last one year, but the last two years is when things have changed. And you know, I think when I first started thinking that we needed a company doing this, um, you know, round about two years ago, um, which is when I started thinking that you, the UK should have a company similar to us. Um, I think it probably would have been a lot harder to to get the support of people and, you know, it it was a long time ago in in the context of what we're talking about, whereas you know, now it's it's almost like everyone still can't believe that there aren't other people you know, doing it the way that we're doing it. Um, so, you know, I' I've I've got absolutely no doubt in my mind that it's, you know, it's a great time to be doing this. Um, you know, and and I think we'll look back at this in 5 years, 10 years time, and, you know, we'll say, well, you know, look how the company's grown from there. Was it an easy decision? So, you're saying like two years ago you were uh you you'd obviously been following Micro Strategy for a while and was it an easy decision for you to just be like, "Well, can I can I do it um with

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:17:30) Well, no. Um no, it wasn't. So, it's it was about a year and a half of me saying, well, who can I invest in? Who else is doing it? You know, I want to do this. Accepting that I can't couldn't do it myself. Um and you know just wanting someone else to do it you know um you know that literally was what I was looking for and then over that period of time you start thinking well you know why isn't anyone doing this you know and and then you start thinking well if no one else is going to do it you know why don't I do it you know like because you know this is one of the the sort of the the core ideas of all of this is I want a company that I can invest in that I think will be wellrun that will follow a suitable strategy for what I believe in, you know, and obviously without being too cheesy, you know, what better way of getting that thing to invest in other than you actually doing it, you know. So, but you know, as I've said to lots of people, you know, to to list the company on the stock market is, you know, a small company. Um, you know, it's it's quite a big deal and it's quite involved. Um, you know, they've been very very long days for quite a few months. And you know I I if I'm honest I didn't think that I could do it and then I spoke to somebody who said well actually that's a great idea you can do that like this you know and and and lo and behold you know here we are. So, um, yeah, it's it's a it's a it's a tricky one to sort of to do and, you know, but I think anyone that's prepared to work hard that believes in something, you know, it's what I tell my kids all the time, you know, you can do whatever you want as long as it's legal and you believe in it. Um, you know, so yeah, that's what's it been like? Um cuz I had this like when I first started this podcast of I didn't I was very like behind the scenes didn't want to be uh like have my face out there or um yeah and just be like as vocal as I am today. How's that been going from I Yeah, I can imagine just having like a company that you're just working away on to like you I'm seeing your face everywhere and I'm seeing the smarter web company everywhere and yeah, what's that what's that transition been like and are you I imagine this will it will just become more and more um as we go on.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:19:50) Yeah. So I'm I suppose I'm quite a private person. You know, I don't lead the most exciting life in the world. I spend most of my time programming in front of my computer. You know, I've got a lovely family and you know, but you know, I don't really do anything too exciting, you know. Um so it's it's a bit strange and it's slightly overwhelming. Um you know, when anyone with any business, you know, small or big, you know, they they put everything into it. um you know and so to see my company which obviously won't be 100% my company anymore you know go from that to that and then hopefully to there um you know is is is pretty cool really you know um you know we've got this saying my wife and I where you know if you do something because you believe in it and you're passionate about it and all of those things you know providing you work hard it normally you know works out quite well. And you know, this is very much one of those things um you know, it's it's it's a bit surreal. I tell you, one of the things that was weird as well was um you know, over the long bank holiday weekend that we've just had, you know, the number of emails that I had from people, you know, emails, messages on LinkedIn, you know, uh DMs on X and um you know, we've got our company WhatsApps on our website. to you know some of those as well you know all coming at me from all angles and and it was you know it was amazing to see the support you know from you know all these different people and I replied to every single one and I'll reply to every single one in the future you know it might take a bit longer if we get really really busy but I will go back to everyone who gets in touch with us and you know answer what I can um and it's it's it it's great but it is surreal when you think that you know something that you've put your life into is then more interesting to more people. Um, but that's a good thing, right?

**Host:**
(0:21:50) 100%. Um, that must be such a Yeah, such a nice feeling to have and it does feel like certainly the UK Bitcoin community is really grouped around um grouped around this. Um, so going moving on to the Bitcoin side of things. Um, how did you cuz I understand that, uh, Tyler Evans, um, and UTXO management are a big part of this. How did you first, how did it come about? Um, did you did you go to them or did they come to you?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:22:15) Yeah. So um you know you know how it is over the years you meet people and you know you you sort of get on with certain people and things and and I was speaking to somebody that I've known for a very very long time really great guy um and I said um you know would you believe it this thing that I've mentioned to you off and on the last two years I've actually managed to sort of progress it and and I was thinking what he would do is he turn around and say you know fair play Andrew you know would you like me to invest you know um and and um and but what he what he actually said to me was, "Yeah, Andrew, you need to speak to this guy." Um so so I spoke to somebody that he knew um who introduced me to his boss, which was Tyler. Um this is I don't know, let's say a week before Christmas, something like that. Um and um it was it was just one of those things where you know I'm doing something at one point in time, someone else on the other side of the world is trying to do something at the same point in time. Um and then because we had a chance encounter um you know it it was something that would work. So we we um you know we had a chat um you know we got on quite well. Um he said he'd like to you know support what we're trying to do in the UK. Um I think because you know obviously they were at the time trying to think right you know we would like a company that's doing this sort of thing in you know all these other parts of the world you know building on the success of you know Japan and so forth. Um and and and and then we just worked together and we made it happen really. And and over the last few months he's been you know a really supportive part of the team. Um, you know, he's got some great ideas. You know, he's got a lot of experience. You know, he's been there, seen it, done it. Um, and, you know, we've we've enjoyed working together so far.

**Host:**
(0:24:20) Yeah. It's so good to see that. I think just there's a graphic out there that's got four companies on it and it's just nice to see you amongst it. Must be quite surreal for you to see that it's like the smarter web company. You've got MetaPlanet, you've got Strategy, and the one in Hong Kong. Um where Hong Kong Asia being rebranded Moon Inc. Yeah, that's the one. Um it that must be so surreal when that came out just to see that.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:24:45) Yeah, it's it's it's it is sort of a bit daunting at times, you know, when you see things like that. Um, you know, but you know, all you've got to do is you've got to get up every single day, work as hard as you can. You know, try and be the best that you can be and and then, you know, sort of improve every single day, you know, where possible. You know, obviously you get the odd bump that comes up, but you know, you you you you take the compliment and and you you try and sort of deliver it really. Um, you know, it's exciting when you see it, you know, as well. Um, But yeah, it's it's it's pretty bold. There's been quite a few cool things that I've seen the last sort of, you know, couple of weeks and you think, "Oh, Christ," you know?

**Host:**
(0:25:20) Yeah, I can imagine that it's uh Yeah. And the thing is that you've got, and I think you've said this before, is you've got a really good business anyway. Uh whereas it happens quite a lot that companies like strategy will when they're just like their stocks kind of flatlining um they're not really going anywhere then they adopted a Bitcoin treasury um strategy and that save saved them essentially. But you're a little bit different that you've got you've got a really good business there.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:25:45) Yeah. So, it didn't um it didn't really hit home till this weekend when I was thinking, hang on a minute. There's not been that many companies globally that have IPOed with a strategy like mine because as you say, most of them are listed companies which then adopt something and they almost say, you know, yeah, forget about the core business. Um, you know, this is what we're doing and and and you know, I I have I've got shares in in quite a few companies like that. Um, and I think they're absolutely great. You know, obviously strategy, you know, right at the top of, you know, the the pyramid or, you know, in terms of, you know, respect and things, but we're inspired by these people, what they've done, but we're also trying to carve our own way. So, we're trying to say that, you know, we've got a good business, you know, it's profitable, it's got reoccurring revenue, very scalable, all of these things that we're trying to grow. And alongside that, we're trying to adopt our, you know, the treasury policy that we believe in. Um, you know, alongside that. So, um, you know, one of what somebody said to me is that, you know, you wouldn't unlock the capital to do that without that. So, you know, I think you have to like, you know, look at it in its entirety and understand what it is. you know, in lots of ways. Say, for example, you only care about us because of the treasury management and you're less interested in the web design side of things, then, you know, you probably do need to realize that the web design side of things contributes to the cost of running a business. You know, that's probably where you can then think, well, yeah, that's enough on the web design side of things. you know, um, you know, if that's what you as an individual decide you want to do when you're looking at our company, because obviously everyone looks at them differently. But then there'll be other people that will look at it and they'll say, well, yeah, you know, I obviously like digital assets, you know, I think, you know, what they're doing with Bitcoin is great, but I can see them doubling, tripling, quadrupling, etc., that side of the business, you know, and and that's what that person will see. So um you know it it's it's not saying that other people are doing anything wrong because they obviously aren't because take MetaPlanet for example the best performing global equity in the last 12 months. You know no one can can argue with that stat. Um you know but we're trying to do what we're trying to do within our country in our regulatory environment. Um and and and that's all we're trying to do. We believe in it. We think it will you know grow be very successful. Um, and you know, we're excited about everything for the future, you know. So, you know, that's not saying that something else is is is is better or worse. It's just saying this is what we're doing. And, you know, maybe long term, you know, um, by long-term in this context, I'm probably thinking 3 to five years. you know, maybe in three to five years, you know, the operating side of the business will be far more important in terms of this type of company that also has got a big treasury because, you know, people might deem that the um you know that that in addition to raising equity to do certain things or or however you do it, you know, that they want that money reinvested, you know, thus sort of compounding what we call the yield, you know. So, you know, I think everyone will look at it as they want to look at it. You know, we believe it's the right model. Um, and we're looking forward to, you know, cracking on with it.

**Host:**
(0:29:30) Yeah. I think the fact that you've caught a lot of people's I mean, putting Bitcoin on in any treasury of any company catches the eye of any Bitcoiner and they will they will pay attention to that. Um, and especially if it's a public company that, as you were saying, can access like the capital markets and that do clever I'm going to just say do clever things to um, accumulate more Bitcoin. Um, but then you've also got the operating side of things which can feed into that. Um, which is, as you said, quite unique and, um, makes you a little bit different. Um what you've got to remember if there was like um say there was a long period of a bad market you know um you know let's say a two-year period um you know a terrible market you know you if you're an operating business you know it may be it may be difficult to raise money at certain times but the operating business gives the comfort that we can carry on with our strategy you know because you know don't forget we've been doing it for 15 years you know you know with things like COVID and all these sorts of, you know, big volatile events that have come up and, you know, we've been profitable historically every single year for 15 years. So, I I think to me, you know, going back to this is a business that's structured as I want to do it, as I want to invest, etc., etc. Um, you know, it's sort of it's different, but I believe that it's the smart way of doing it. The smarter way of doing it. Haven't used one before, would you believe? 50 years. Oh, wow. I thought that would always be coming out. No, never. Probably shouldn't come out. Uh I did see somewhere on X someone was asking because your uh your brand is um black and like light blue. Someone was asking, "Do you plan to do you plan to make that orange?" Um kind of like what Strategy have done. Just they've just gone full whack. um with the Bitcoin even a Bitcoin logo in their in their name.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:31:30) Yeah, I I I don't know. You know, I I've I've you know, I wouldn't go as far as to say I've thought about these things um you know, at the current point because there's so many different things, but you know, I wouldn't rule it out in the future. Um you know, we'll just have to wait and see how we go on that one. Um so, you know, it certainly wouldn't be a difficult thing to do. you know, it's it's something that, you know, being designers ourselves, you know, we're quite uh quite able to change those sorts of things should we want to in the future.

**Host:**
(0:31:55) Yeah. Um, so I met I I heard on a X spaces and I don't know if you can or want to talk about this, but the I think it was Tyler saying someone asked what is what's the goal over the next like 6 12 couple of years when it comes to the accumulation strategy around that and are we able to are we able to touch on this a little bit?

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:32:15) Yeah, I suppose we can. Um so I want to build a company that is continuously growing. Um so by that I mean for the shareholders you know in terms of what they see i.e. share price growth. Um for the company as a whole in terms of you know it's it's its value you know however that's made up with all the different business units. Um you know I want to be better at what we're doing every single day. um you know and and and I I also slightly longer term I want to be something that the UK can be really proud of you know a really good company that's come out of the UK everyone saw it in front of them and then saw it grow and grow and hopefully over a fairly short time period as well um I I've sort of resisted the sort of the temptation to say you know like take MetaPlanet for example they went from zero to a thousand bitcoins in six months you know Tyler and I have had chats about you how it would be quite nice to beat that one. Um, you know, we'll we'll we'll see on that one. Um, you know, but I I I wouldn't want to sort of stick my neck out and say that, you know, within 6 months, 12 months, you know, we will have done X, Y, and Z. All I can promise people is that, you know, we're going to grow. We're ambitious. You know, you can see from elements of, you know, our our background, both Tyler and I, that, you know, we've done some quite good things in the past. um and you know sort of judges by our by our actions rather than what we we say above the fact that we're trying to push things forward.

**Host:**
(0:33:50) Yeah. I and what I really liked is I read an article um that was it money week or this is money um around this and it it quoted you and it said I'd like to be a Footsie 100 company. Uh people might laugh when I say that because when you're a small company that's just wait when you're a small company that's just listing it sound sounds I've written that down wrong. I well I know the quote that that you mean you know and and you know I I I I think that that's that's a perfectly reasonable thing to say because you know when I look at HL you know no one no one thought that would be a listed business then they didn't think it'd be in the 250 then the 100 you know then it became you know a private company again this year um because it got bought out um you know when I set up my business you know everyone said that's a very competitive space, you know, you're not, you know, you might not be able to make success of that. You know, lots of people at the time, they said to me, you know, sure you want to set up your own business. Why don't you just, you know, go and get a job working for someone else? You've got some great experience and get that all the time. But yeah, but you know, you you you know, things things are possible. Um, and you know, we 100% believe in in what we're doing. And you know you look at the examples of similarish companies in in in different countries and you can see the the growth has been incredible in them. So you know if everyone gets behind us if we execute well if we continue offering a good service to our clients you know I I believe it's all possible you know but I won't say the time scales you know you know I think well I I won't say the time but I don't think talking multi multi multi years you know. Yeah. Um, you know, we're talking years, you know, but, you know, everything's possible.

**Host:**
(0:35:50) Yeah. And I think it's just exciting to have this in the UK because it's always been This is why we So, we ran a conference in Edinburgh in 2022. Um, and that's why we did it was because we were looking at America. We were like, they're doing this, they're doing that, and we were like, what are we doing? So, we just not the same, but we just kind of had, we like to say, a [ __ ] it moment. And it was just like, well, nobody's doing it, so we'll do it. And it's so great to see that cuz I was looking for companies as well. Um, in the UK, I was like, who can I invest in that's doing this and is adopting the same strategy. Uh, so it's so nice to see that you've just you've just done it. And yeah, it it's such a I think yeah, it just makes it when the UK is very negative towards Bitcoin to have this story come out at this time is like such big news. And yeah, I'm just I'm very grateful that you've you've actually put the work in and and actually making this happen.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:36:45) Well, I I appreciate that, you know, like if you think that, you know, if everyone in the country did something big or small, you know, to make everything a bit better, things do get better, right? That's how it works. Yeah. You know, and you know, this is one of the things that I can try and do to sort of move things forward. You know, I have a joke with my American friends of, you know, we're going to get some, you know, like their Donald Trump hats, you know, but instead of make America great, we're going to get make the UK great again, you know, and and and and I I believe that, you know, if we all work together and we all try and, you know, then, you know, like I know things get tough for everyone in in different ways at different times and things aren't easy out there, but there is a lot of hope for the future and, you know, we are um you know, we're we're doing what we're doing and I genuinely hope that people can look back at us in the future and say that you know this was you know the birth and then the growth of you know one of the UK's better companies and you know you never know within a couple of years we'll be having this chat again and we would have just been admitted to the Footsie 100 Megan.

**Host:**
(0:38:00) Yeah, I will definitely have you on when that happens. I want exclusive to that one. No problem. Um, I got one last question before we wrap up, but do you think we will see this as more of a, so holding Bitcoin on your balance sheet, creating Bitcoin treasuries, do you think we'll see this as more of a trend going forward, not just amongst public companies, but it's already emerging amongst private companies as well. Um, and I think having this story um that you're you're directing, you're building um really adds to that and shows people like this is what they've done. Um, and because I would like to see a lot more businesses in the UK adopt that sort of strategy, private or public.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:38:35) Yeah. Yeah, for sure. And and and I would echo that. So whether it's other companies, you know, pivoting that already listed or other companies that decide to get listed and do similar things to what we we're doing or private companies, you know, the more the merrier. You know, I I think that the more companies that adopt this strategy, the better. Um I think it's better for the companies, it's better for whoever owns those companies. I think it's better for Bitcoin. Um you know, the more different companies are doing it, the more diversified it is, of course, as well, which I know is quite important to some people. um you know so you know if there's any companies out there that are thinking of doing it and they want a little bit of advice then you know just get in touch you know I'll help um you know I'm I'm more than happy to help if I can um you know and and you know why not you know like I I don't I don't think that um that cash has definitely been the kindest of of sort of assets for people over the last few years you know particularly older people for example um you know who who then can't generate new cash um you know so you know it's it's it's arguably um you know without sort of saying anything that the legal people wouldn't like arguably the best asset the world's ever seen um you know and obviously I believe it is um so um you know why why not align yourself with it yeah it's uh a good play and I'm very happy to see you taking action and actually doing this and yeah, it's a big week for you and yeah, this episode will be going out as soon as uh you go public. So yeah, I just want to say congrats to you for getting to this point and yeah, thank you for coming on and chatting to me.

**Andrew Webley:**
(0:40:30) Yeah, no worries. Thanks for talking and also um you know, we'll give you an update in a few weeks or months or something of how it's going and you know, until then just stay in touch. Anyway,
