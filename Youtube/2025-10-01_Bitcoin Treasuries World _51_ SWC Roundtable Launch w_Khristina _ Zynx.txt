**Anders:**
(0:00:02) Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Bitcoin Treasuries World number 51 with a launch of SWC roundtable which is three people who have invested in SWC. I'm excited about this stock and see a lot of upside and we just get together and talk about that and happily sharing that and none of it is financial advice. It's financial education information at best. That's what it is. Khristina and Zynx, good to see you guys here. Great conversation already in the green room the last 10 minutes here. How are you guys doing and welcome?

**Khristina:**
(0:00:41) Doing great. Happy to be here. Happy to chat Smarter Web and whatever else comes up.

**Zynx:**
(0:00:47) And yeah, I'm doing great. Thank you for having me. Extremely happy to talk about Smarter Web. It's a special story for you, isn't it? Since you were there from the beginning.

**Zynx:**
(0:00:55) Yeah, absolutely. Since IPO the 25th of April from a 3.7 million market cap all the way to the highs of over a billion pounds back down to 300 million pound market cap to watch the community grow from 10 members to over 4,400. Yeah, it's pretty much where I built sort of my platform really just by giving Smarter Web analysis. So many great guys in the community. But yeah, it's been a story for me for sure.

**Anders:**
(0:01:31) Awesome. And Khristina, what's your story with SWC, I guess?

**Khristina:**
(0:01:38) Yeah so I was later to the story because I was so focused on MetaPlanet in early May and then with the hype around all of the Bitcoin treasury companies, you know, I dove into Smarter Web. I actually looked back at my trading history before I caught up with James last week and noticed that like in a week period of time I had bought the stock and without having the numbers in front of me somewhere around $1.30 and then 9 or 10 days later sold it in the sixes and so just to think of the euphoria that we experienced back in that time frame. But then I did buy shares and I kept buying shares. And my average cost basis is much higher than where we are trading now. And so I've really gone through the process of okay, did I just jump into this without knowing what I owned? FOMO of missing out of not owning you know all of these Bitcoin treasury companies and it's become a pretty large position because I was averaging my cost down. And after, you know, diving in and doing more work, I was like, absolutely have conviction. Love the story, love the management team, happy I'm an investor and I'm in it for the long term.

**Anders:**
(0:03:03) Yeah. And similar with me obviously not being in it from the beginning. I do recall specifically walking somewhere in the evening listening to a podcast. It was the first time I heard Andrew and thinking like this guy sounds pretty reasonable and humble which is I think always a great sign and smart and thinking you know that's probably going to be good but I don't know how to get these stocks that are listed on some secondary exchange in UK but just checking now as we're speaking I bought MetaPlanet the 2nd of and SWC I bought tiny bit of in June the 17th and I haven't ever sold anything. I haven't been as smart as you, Khristina, taking chips off the table at a high MNAV, but I've been buying ever since and all my positions are below water, but I am still sitting here smiling because I am incredibly bullish and I see a lot of upside and look I've been looking forward to this conversation with you guys really ever since we did a round table on MetaPlanet which I thought was really good conversation. So, excited for the future here for SWC.

**Khristina:**
(0:04:23) Yeah, I just looked at my account and of the shares that I didn't trade and I just kind of have held, my first purchase of those was July 16th. So, $3.35 a share and then I was been buying it, you know, kind of all the way down into kind of mid and end of September. So, it's become a fairly large position as I've said, but it's one that, you know, and especially this time of year, I think a lot of people, at least in the US, I don't know how the tax situation is in other countries, but start to look at their portfolio and think, you know, okay, where may I possibly take tax losses to offset capital gains? And we have a wash sale rule here where if you sell a security, if I sold my Smarter Web today and took a big loss on it, I wouldn't be able to buy it back for 30 days or else that loss I can't realize. And so people do try to manage taxes starting in the fourth quarter. But after really digging in, I'm like, I'm not going to sell this. I'm just going to keep it. I like the story. I like the management. I believe in Bitcoin. So it's a hold slash add to on further weakness.

**Anders:**
(0:05:31) Totally. Zynx anything you want to add? I don't want to jump in on the mic all the time. I want to give you guys good ample opportunity to speak your thoughts.

**Zynx:**
(0:05:43) Yeah. So, when it comes to my position, obviously, you know, I've made a lot of money, you know, because I got in at the IPO, which, you know, is obviously very fortunate to be the case. I still have more shares than what I did have from IPO. So, you know what that tells me and you is that I'm incredibly bullish on the stock. So, I have plans to be with this company until we get to the top of the Footsie 100.

**Anders:**
(0:06:24) Excellent. And speaking of in terms of catalyst and I guess overall the sentiment that I have and I think but I won't speak for you one or two of you maybe share that that right now risk-reward of SWC to me could be the most appealing across the globe and all capital markets. And I'm not saying that there's not others that obviously are fantastic. I just think right now SWC to me is an absolute gem in terms of risk-reward. So, might as well jump into I did a few bullet points here that I wanted to cover also apart from I know you guys have some thoughts lined up but in terms of catalyst and the upside and I think also that's why it makes sense for you Khristina not necessarily to sell now and have to wait 30 days before you can buy it back because this thing could double if not triple if not more by that time right but there's a likely I think London Stock Exchange uplisting in Q4. So that would be within the next 3 months which will as we know from Andrew when he was on here last Wednesday that will unlock quite a bit of capital. So that will drive further Bitcoin purchases, yield for the existing shareholders more Bitcoin per share. Then there's the Footsie 250 which I think probably in terms of size could come very quickly after that and then the Footsie 100 maybe a little bit further on the horizon. I don't know how far if it's sometime next year or even later. But so that's some of the bullish catalyst I see right now. What about you guys? What did I miss?

**Khristina:**
(0:08:13) Well, Zynx we'll let him speak to it, but he had a post this morning with an incremental data point that helps with the LSE uplisting. So Zynx, why don't you share what you uncovered?

**Zynx:**
(0:08:26) Yeah. So today there was an appointment, an announcement of an appointment of a non-executive director and essentially an independent non-executive director. Essentially you need two of these to meet the criteria to uplist to the LSE. So we just need one more and you know from the hiring of the CFO. So there's been steps that are crystal clear to me that an LSE uplisting is coming in Q4. First we had the change of auditors to you know Footsie Standard top 10 in the UK. Then we had an appointment of the CFO who has come from a Footsie 250 company and then this independent non-executive director you know again from a Footsie 100 company. One more and all the criteria, the conditions would have been met and it's just a matter of doing the paperwork. We have precedent of another company that does Bitcoin mining, has Bitcoin in the balance sheet and they uplisted to the LSE main market at a 40 million pound market cap. So we are you know almost 10x that and you know things are clearly as per the RNS's an LSE uplisting is coming.

**Anders:**
(0:09:56) Nice and yeah I don't know how long time it will take but likely Q4 so that's good. And I think also when you look at comparing that to other treasury companies and there are some big catalysts also for MetaPlanet and everything, but it just seems like in terms of the relative weight and what it can do that what SWC is looking at with London Stock Exchange uplisting it looks very significant and strong, right?

**Khristina:**
(0:10:21) And I would say that I think Smarter Web's flywheel really seems to be working right now in terms of how they're raising capital and acquiring Bitcoin.

**Anders:**
(0:10:33) Yeah. And it's happening almost every day. There's a couple of the guys and sorry I don't remember all the names always but that have done some work at looking at the volume and the price movement and are able to pretty precisely I think figure out how many Bitcoin are mined.

**Zynx:**
(0:10:52) Shout out to you guys. John and Andy absolute legends. John Mahoney the legend. Yep. And Andy Smith.

**Anders:**
(0:11:03) And Andy Smith. Awesome. Thanks. Zynx and I think they have mined three Bitcoin so far today, SWC, and it all adds up.

**Khristina:**
(0:11:16) It absolutely adds up and I think you know one of the things that struck me when I was talking to Andrew at the unconference and we had a little bit of a one-on-one just asking him briefly about his operating business and his operating business generates cash flow, right? And it's incremental and you know it's not any big numbers by any means but he's able to purchase Bitcoin with the cash flow from his operating business and that's a positive, that's definitely a positive.

**Anders:**
(0:11:52) And shout out to John and Andy. So, one of the reasons that I right now see SWC as probably the best risk-reward globally of all equities is the amount of Bitcoin they have and their upside because there's no doubt a lot of these treasury companies will be buying a lot of Bitcoin. But going back, I did a I ran a few numbers and this is something I kind of started looking at when I did a keynote in Helsinki on investing in treasury companies. So I need to update that and make a specific show sharing that. But here's the situation or the part looking at SWC. They right now hold 2,525 Bitcoin with a diluted MNAV of 1.4. The market cap of SWC, the price of the company measured in Bitcoin, which is the only true denominator in my world, the market cap is only 3,535 Bitcoin, and they have a target of acquiring 210,000 Bitcoin. But if they acquire just half of that 105,000 Bitcoin, that is essentially a 30x outperformance of Bitcoin in terms of value growth. And so that's it's not just by investing in treasury companies, you know, over time you'll make 20% more or something. And I'm not saying that there's aspects where nothing can compete with Bitcoin and cold storage naturally, but in terms of investment and the part of your portfolio where you go further out on the risk curve, just to run those numbers. So, if Bitcoin goes to 25 million, which I believe is a matter of time, then $1,000 invested in Bitcoin will reach 200,000. But with this outperformance, $1,000 invested in SWC today would go to $6 million. And I think that's why we all like these treasury companies if they can perform well. And if they do reach their target, $1,000 invested goes to $12 million. So like my point is like do you see why this is relevant or interesting to say the least. Thoughts guys?

**Zynx:**
(0:14:12) So when it comes to the Bitcoin price who knows where it's going to be. I'm conservative and I say 2035 a million dollars a coin absolutely take it. Fits within the Bitcoin power law you know range. But essentially what you're talking about is compounding these Bitcoin treasury companies compounding your Bitcoin per share. And with Smarter Web, for example, I can give you since IPO, the SATs per share was just two. Now it's 900. So in the space of 5 months, they've 450x'd your Bitcoin exposure. Well, they've increased the SATs per share by 450x, which, you know, I don't need to say anymore. The numbers speak for themselves.

**Anders:**
(0:15:02) Absolutely. I mean, incredible journey. I wish I had been there since the beginning, but I'm still happy if they do 30 or 60x the Bitcoin exposure from here. You add that to your 450 and you'll be laughing. I think you're laughing already, Zynx.

**Zynx:**
(0:15:18) Well, yeah. And the thing is the craziest thing is because it IPO'd so low, this is still base level. This is still very very early. You know, we're talking about a company that's on the Aquis exchange. It's a 300 million pound market cap, you know.

**Khristina:**
(0:15:38) And Bitcoin really hasn't even moved, right? I mean, yes, we hit a new all-time high, but we're not even back to that yet. And we're in October. Maybe we'll hit a new all-time high this month. I mean, I think that's the expectation, but I actually thought we would be much higher today if you were to ask me, you know, in December of last year.

**Anders:**
(0:16:02) But it's coming. It's coming. I agree.

**Zynx:**
(0:16:08) I did hear October, right, Khristina? October. Yes. It's been a good day today.

**Khristina:**
(0:16:16) Yeah. I don't even recall 118. I mean 118 is really kind of the breakout level that I think we need to get over because we've been in this narrow band of kind of 112 to 118. So I think if we're able to move above 118 and kind of sustain that to some extent, we will reach a new leg higher.

**Zynx:**
(0:16:40) I'm of the opinion that the bull run doesn't really count until we get over $151,000. And that is the all-time high for the current gold price. Bitcoin denominated in gold ounces. So, you know, I think Bitcoin's just been lagging, but all the factors are there for an incredible next six months in my opinion.

**Anders:**
(0:17:05) I'm writing that down Zynx. So, I think a data point. We'll take it. So, another thing that we spoke about in the green room before we got started and we've spoken about it before is the SWC community. I mean, one thing is management. We'll get to management as well, but the SWC community, despite the entire downturn and the stocks being suppressed across the board in this industry, is just like we're still having fun. People are still here to a large extent and we're just drooling over the upside here. And like I'm in daily communication with the SWC, you know, fellow investors on X, which I don't have really to the same extent in other communities. I just the feeling I'm getting is like very positive on the SWC community and the like stuff going on like Andy and John figuring out how to calculate all right today how many Bitcoin did we mine right and tomorrow we'll get new reports like several during the days it's a very strong community the strongest I can see in my opinion.

**Zynx:**
(0:18:11) Can I just give you a story about why and talk you through why it is the best community because it matters and it's important. So to begin with, remember it IPO'd at £3.7 million market cap. It was open to British investors. So, you know, there was a lot of British people that were able to get involved and make a lot of money in the community. People have, you know, had good weddings. They've bought houses. They've retired already, you know, from this company. And other things like there being no discounted raises is very important. We also have, you know, in the UK we haven't had a British company to get behind since maybe there was a company that wasn't even public. It was called DeepMind and it was an AI play that got acquired by Google back in 2010 I think.

**Anders:**
(0:19:15) And since then the Footsie 100, you know, as I told you guys before, over the last 10 years, the CAGR has been 5%.

**Zynx:**
(0:19:27) Look, Scottish Mick said the community has changed his life. You see, you know, people are willing to get behind this company. Very, very strong home support. And yeah, it's just been building naturally. You know, Andrew goes to these conferences in the UK. He's willing to speak to the community. He comes to the front even when the stock is down. And it's hard to, you know, explain how much people are behind Andrew, how the British investors are behind Andrew and Smarter Web. So yeah.

**Khristina:**
(0:20:06) Yeah, I think that's incredible. And you know I think if you contrast that with the MetaPlanet community which I'm very involved in and I love and I think it's a great community. I think what happened there is you had a lot of investors buy all the way up with the huge momentum and people were just you know following posts and not forming their own conviction and not really sure what they were buying. And the stock ran what up over $15 and now here we are down in the threes and so people lost a lot of money very quickly and I think that really without having their own conviction and maybe not sizing their position appropriately and I think it really you know hurt sentiment for that particular group on the back of you know the Japanese component of it where the Japanese investors I've described as being a bit more timid. When I spoke to James last week on his podcast, someone shared a data point and I had just kind of pulled it up that said 65% of Americans invest, 50% of Canadians, 35% of British, and only 15% Japanese. And so from the Japanese side, timid investors that maybe weren't so used to investing potentially getting big losses. I think UK is somewhere in the middle between US and MetaPlanet, but it's just a different, it just feels different right now in terms of the sentiment.

**Anders:**
(0:21:52) I think one point with that. So definitely it says like if there's less people investing I guess part of your point is that the upside is maybe bigger in terms of or I'm not sure what you're getting at there but in terms of Japan I know that a lot of the money not going into stocks is because Japanese love to have half their money in cash like either under the mattress or seven and a half trillion in savings per the presentation that MetaPlanet released last night.

**Khristina:**
(0:22:30) Nice. And for MetaPlanet that bodes well for products that yes will still be an investment for people. So, will they be willing to go from cash to a cash yielding pretty secured like principal investment like basically an account where you deposit your cash and you can get potentially a very high return compared to you don't get any returns on anything short term in Japan. Right.

**Zynx:**
(0:23:02) But Zynx made a good point which he can speak to just in terms of the income on the Footsie versus the CAGR unless you already brought it up here.

**Zynx:**
(0:23:14) No, I just I'll touch on that because I actually think the UK is actually pretty well primed for, you know, press and I'll tell you why. But just going back to the community quickly, yes, it IPO'd and it was open to retail investors, but for the first four, five, 6 weeks, there was also retail reps which allowed the company to raise money alongside something called an accelerated book build. So what you would do is he would raise capital, get the institutions and retail were allowed to partake. So what you had was week after week retail investors were able to get on board at the same price as the institutions and this happened you know multiple weeks in a row and this is why the sentiment was so built the foundations were so solid and by that point we had people creating websites and you mention about the statistics about the Bitcoin mining that John and Andy post about every morning these guys give me an email that tracks... This is for free. These guys love the company. Every morning I get an email that tracks community members, you know, the location of the community members, trading volume, weekly, daily, treasuries community ranking. They even track Andrew's Bitcoin following, sorry, X followers, you know, like they track all the data points. You've got a lot of people spending hours just free time, obviously Jamie that created the community, hours, sorry, James, hours just building this thing. So yeah, that's that point.

**Zynx:**
(0:24:58) Just going on to the fixed income bit, the UK is extremely unique in the sense that our premier index, the Footsie 100, is well known for having, you know, low growth but high dividends. You know the Footsie 100 you can expect to get around 3% every year. So people are primed to receiving you know income from their shareholdings. The CAGR for the last 10 years has been 5% extremely low but you know the dividends is higher than let's say the S&P 500 but also more importantly and this is key when it comes to the distribution of fixed income products we have two main brokers HL and AJ Bell whereas Strategy they struggle with their distribution they've got to talk to a lot of... Andrew has to talk to two companies and that will cover 60% of the UK market. And guess who was the head of online at the largest UK broker who built their online platform? Andrew, the way it's gone full circle is absolutely crazy. So he will be able to distribute these Smarter Preferreds when the time is right through these platforms. And I suspect uptake when you see 8% 9% is going to be fabulous because they non-stop harass me these companies with UK government treasuries by you know 30-year gilt we call our bonds gilts you know at 5% no thank you I don't want that insolvent you know getting debased whereas imagine they're doing an email now buy your Smarter Preferred yielding 60% of the... That's like an enormous incremental positive for Smarter Web.

**Khristina:**
(0:26:47) Because I absolutely agree that Strategy in the US has struggled with the right distribution and I think that you know leans into that regulations in the US as it relates to Bitcoin and Bitcoin related investments have only recently eased and so educating the banks on Bitcoin let alone a Bitcoin backed preferred and which bankers are on the deals and you know, we have so many firms, you know, large institutional primarily with high net worth departments and then you have the smaller brokers and then the... it's just it's scattered absolutely everywhere and I think we...

**Anders:**
(0:27:31) Oh, she froze. Yeah. There's been I think the heavy trading activity going on in the household of Khristina sometime takes a little bit of the internet. We just lost you Khristina for the last 10 seconds if you don't mind repeating.

**Khristina:**
(0:27:49) Oh what was I saying? It froze. Where did I leave off?

**Anders:**
(0:27:55) You were talking about the distribution of the Strategy preferreds.

**Khristina:**
(0:27:55) I was just saying that the distribution of the Strategy preferred in the US I think has been a real hindrance just the way that the US is structured across you know large institutional banks high net worth clients small brokerages you know smaller wealth managers and I don't think there's been any type of concentrated or dedicated effort to actually proactively put these products in front of investors especially because you know banking regulations here have only recently eased as it relates to Bitcoin Bitcoin related investments and so I think it's going to take some time. So, it sounds like what Zynx has just said with respect to the Smarter Web, I mean that's huge. That's really important.

**Zynx:**
(0:28:41) So really important. That will be a strength when the preferreds come. Speaking of preferreds from Strategy, they increased the STRK dividend from 10 to 10 and a quarter%. So hopefully for Strategy we can start getting closer to $100 for that equity. Otherwise they have to keep increasing it as per the guidelines.

**Anders:**
(0:29:08) Right. Which hopefully won't change.

**Khristina:**
(0:29:14) Hopefully it stimulates demand. You know maybe they're going to have to raise it probably a bit higher. But I also think you know raising it might not stimulate demand because I don't think demand is lacking because the products are lacking. I think demand is lacking because the distribution is lacking. And so until they are able to identify a better distribution channel they can continue to raise the dividend. And the only people that are really knowing about these products are those of us who follow Saylor and are on X. Like I really don't think there's this like broad-based effort to educate people outside who are focused on, you know, stable, you know, pristinely backed asset, high yielding products. There's just I don't I doubt that's happening.

**Anders:**
(0:30:06) And that's why it was a shame. I mean, that's one of the reasons it was a shame that they were not included in S&P 500 this first time around. That would automatically have increased the creditworthiness credit rating of Strategy and as I understand it would also automatically spill over to the credit rating of any fixed income product they put out there. Hopefully we'll see it in December if not December likely next year. It will happen. It will happen.

**Zynx:**
(0:30:37) Yeah, it's a matter of time. And just to relate that back to Smarter Web in the UK we don't have that political process. If we reach the market cap, we will be automatically included into the Footsie 250 and then the Footsie 100. So, as soon as you qualify, Smarter Web will be, you know, progressed into the next index.

**Khristina:**
(0:31:01) I love that it's a rules-based approach and it's not open to subjectivity by a committee that you don't even know who's on the committee or what their views are, if they're politically biased one way or the other. I mean it just again another reason that Smarter Web is in a very good position in terms of incremental catalysts and next steps.

**Anders:**
(0:31:20) Absolutely. Not sure if you know this, Zynx, you're the only one of us actually present in UK if you know the market size but I think trillions...

**Zynx:**
(0:31:33) I did a post very early on. I probably should start reposting them because at the beginning of the IPO I just made a lot of posts analyzing the UK market but the UK fixed income market is well over 3-4-5 trillion pounds. That's not the issue. You know we're well primed for these fixed income products. I just wanted to quickly address a lot of the comments tend to be people that are scared about the UK situation right now. I think some people, oh, well, the UK, they see on the news. I just want to say a couple of things to that.

**Anders:**
(0:32:08) Number one, the current government that is in power, they are very unlikely to win the next election.

**Zynx:**
(0:32:14) Number two, on the 8th of October, the FCA have now allowed the crypto ETNs. So, you know, there's a slight warming towards Bitcoin and crypto in general. And that was actually stimulated by Smarter Web because the regulators were like well they you know they found a roundabout way to invest into Bitcoin through Smarter Web so we have no choice but to allow these ETNs. Obviously the ETNs are not the ETFs. So it's still you know I don't know who would buy in to be honest but in our tax privileged accounts ISAs and SIPPs which has again you know over a trillion pounds in them our only way to get exposure to Bitcoin up until the 8th of October was MSTR and then Smarter Web you know these Bitcoin treasury companies so even still we don't have Bitcoin ETFs and the third final point is if things ever got so bad, the Brits have a lots of overseas territories where tax is zero. British Virgin Islands. Andrew can pick up and take his family and go to Gibraltar. You know, with a masters at hiding money, we still got all our territories in the Caribbean and it wouldn't be a problem. You know, worst case scenario if there was a weird environment in the UK. These territories are autonomous and that's what people with wealth do anyways. Just headquarter the company here, still be listed in the Footsie, no problem. So, when it comes to political risk and anything like that, please do not worry.

**Khristina:**
(0:33:57) I'm curious if I can ask you Zynx, just being in the UK, like what's the sentiment or investor sentiment or awareness around just Bitcoin as an asset?

**Zynx:**
(0:34:04) It's growing. It's definitely growing. We had, you know, the party that's currently leading the polls, the leader, Nigel Farage, was at the Bitcoin conference in Vegas and he spoke about lowering tax to 10% if he wins. We also have now plenty of UK Bitcoin Treasury companies. We've got Bitcoin Policy UK, you know, with Freddy. They're doing great work. We've also got the Bitcoin Collective which is a grassroots movement and we're starting to get more and more events and you know I think it is slowly expanding and it's definitely on the up. It's probably not it's not probably it's definitely not as advanced in the US.

**Khristina:**
(0:34:57) But the US doesn't feel advanced just as a person being here. I mean, yes, I guess we are on a relative basis, but you know, sharing a story, I went to my son's back to school night last night at his high school, and I've never been there before because he transferred in from his freshman year. He's now a sophomore going to a new school, and I don't live in the town that the school's in. His dad lives in that town. So, I wore a Bitcoin hat thinking, "Okay, I'm going to go in I'm going to see if there's any Bitcoiners here and you know, just to check it out." So, I wore a hat. I was actually the only parent, even the men, that had a trucker hat on. So maybe I didn't get the memo and the dress code, but it was only and there and my son's has over a thousand kids at this school and over a hundred like staff members. And then if you think about parents, of course, not every parent came, but there were a ton of people there. The auditorium was filled. And then you went and you followed your child's schedule into each classroom to meet the teachers. It was only the very last class at 9:00 at night and the second teacher was like, "Oh, is that a, you know, a Boston Red Sox hat or Bitcoin? Is that a Bitcoin hat?" I was like, "You're the only person, you know, who brought it up." And it was kind of a test because I think everyone should know about Bitcoin. And he's like, "Oh, until it crash." You know, the sentiment is just so negative. But it was literally one person at the very end and not anyone else made a comment.

**Zynx:**
(0:36:20) You see, I mean, and that's in the US, right, where you have a president going to the Bitcoin conference. Unfortunately, it's like that, but squared in the UK, and that's why we all spend so much time online, right? Because you come off X...

**Khristina:**
(0:36:39) I almost wonder if, and I haven't checked out other channels, but I, you know, I do wear a Bitcoin hat a lot. You know, if I go to a concert, I'll like wear it in the parking lot when I tailgate, and we'll like walk around and I'll be like, "Do you know what this means? Can I tell you?" And then I like try to orange pill people just as for fun. But I was getting my nails done in New York City actually before the unconference and I was talking to the manicurist who is from the Ukraine and I was asking her if she has to send money to her family. And she said she did and I was like, "Well, how do you send it?" and you know, do you know about Bitcoin and it's so simple and there's like no middleman and the fees versus, you know, no fees. And she's like, oh well, you know, do you write a blog? Do you post about it? I said, oh, I'm on, you know, Twitter. There's a great community. She's like, oh. She's like, everyone's only on, you know, YouTube and TikTok. She's like, I'm not gonna, you know, download Twitter. But I don't know if there is a community of people who talk about Bitcoin on these other social media platforms, but it does feel like there's a huge opportunity to educate people if someone had the energy to do that, which I do not.

**Zynx:**
(0:37:55) Yeah, this definitely it goes back to my understanding of things is that you know in the West because our currencies are still terrible but it's not as bad. It's not a necessity in the sense well it is a necessity if you don't want to get poor but in the sense that people can live their day-to-day lives and inflation is not 20% every month. So if you go to places like Turkey, Nigeria, Argentina, they all know about Bitcoin, the general population, whereas in America and in the UK, it's reserved to, you know, the nerds and the financially astute individuals. So, you know, it's definitely going to take another 10x in Bitcoin price before, you know, perhaps it's something that people would consider on the street and they like, "Oh, Bitcoin." But yeah, unfortunately there's always a big percent of the population that just have no idea about investing and it's quite sad really.

**Anders:**
(0:38:58) But yeah, it's the same with when I'm in Denmark. I spent about two months in Denmark this summer and wearing this cap MicroStrategy. Nobody knows that what MicroStrategy is that they have a Bitcoin strategy of acquiring more Bitcoin. No, no one knows. Like it's still so early. It's really so anyone's here watching this have been exposed to Bitcoin and treasury companies. You are pre-rich likely, but it won't go up in a straight line. We have volatility and you're experiencing it right now. But the three of us are sitting here laughing because the upside from here looks ridiculous.

**Khristina:**
(0:39:38) I know. We should get the CEO of Bitcoin to do some like TV commercials. Yeah, we should. And donate to political parties, etc.

**Anders:**
(0:39:50) One thing we've already spoken about before, how we're happy with management. It really has been flawless, flawless execution from day one at the IPO from Andrew and whoever he hired, Jesse, etc. And he was really bold in his commitment to doing no discounts.

**Khristina:**
(0:40:10) You know, that was such a great statement by him and on a podcast that I watched that he did recently. You know, he's very right like if you give the discount, then the next person wants a discount, maybe they want more of a discount and it just, you know, sets this precedence that if you just draw a line in the sand from the beginning and that's your policy...

**Anders:**
(0:40:36) Damn. Yeah, she'll come back though. Company should do it. I know Zynx, you feel very taken in the right capital at the right time and he's proven that's the best model.

**Zynx:**
(0:40:43) He's already been talking about rejecting 200 million pounds worth of capital because it's not on the right terms. You see, I'm, you know, with these Bitcoin treasury companies, some people are having the traditional financial, you know, TradFi mindset of this is how things always work. This is a capital market. But if you know what you have and you've got value, they will have to move to your position. And I think Smarter Web having this distinctly, you know, out of all the outside of, you know, the newer Bitcoin treasury companies having no discounts, you know, as a shareholder, you're going to be protected and looked after. And how the ATM works is, you know, it only works on up days. So if the stock's going down, you know, it's not the ATM. And I think these conditions build so much trust and when things like MNAV relies on sentiment so much, it's just super important. You know, perhaps you may miss out on some capital, but like you said, he's got the policy from the beginning. If you want to deal with Smarter Web, there's no foolishness. You know, you can't ask for these discounts. And it's become his strength. It's become his anchor.

**Anders:**
(0:41:48) And look what's happened with the community now. He's stronger than ever before. And in this down period, no one has complained about Andrew. Nobody's complained. You know, the whining in the Smarter Web community is non-existent because every week we've got the proof of work. DoctoCoin MD, he posts, you know, he's got beautiful graphic that shows what we've done every week. You know, he set trends, Andrew. He started doing the weekly updates. You see, now everyone's doing them. That's all come from Andrew.

**Khristina:**
(0:42:26) Yep. And I think that you know policy from the beginning just really set the tone in terms of you know a strong moral compass and his ethics just as it relates to really you can expand that beyond no discounts just in terms of how he approaches the business and he's doing what's in the best interest of the shareholders.

**Anders:**
(0:42:49) Absolutely. Yeah, we agreed on that. All right. So, as I said early on, I see SWC right now as the best risk-reward globally, among all equities. As it is a round table we're doing, let's take it around the table. Starting with you, Khristina. Do you see it the same way? What's your thoughts?

**Khristina:**
(0:43:18) I mean, I really like the risk-reward of Smarter Web here. And I'll just speak to my own position and I think that's probably the fairest way to do it. I can say that if I were allocating more money to any company, any BTC right now, it would be Smarter Web. I would caveat that by saying that MetaPlanet is my single largest Bitcoin treasury company and that I wouldn't be allocating money to it right now only because it's significantly larger than my Smarter Web position. MetaPlanet stock is down significantly. And I do think they have, you know, a real opportunity with the preferreds in the Japanese market which are in the pipeline. But I do think that they have to get these preferreds to market in order to see the stock, you know, move higher and continue to work. And I don't think we have clarity right now on what the timeline is for those products. And so a dollar today would probably go into Smarter Web just because I do think there's more clarity. Their capital raise situation is working. You have the potential catalyst with the uplist and then the Footsie inclusions and there's not a lot of question marks. Whereas with MetaPlanet although there's a significant opportunity and the valuation is very compelling the catalyst for MetaPlanet right now aren't as clear because we don't have you know real clarity on the timing of the preferreds which everyone is waiting for. So, I think that's as balanced of an opinion as I can give.

**Anders:**
(0:45:06) No, I love it. Thank you, Khristina. Before jumping to you, Zynx, I just want to comment on that. And part of that lack of clarity is like we expect the preferred to kill it for MetaPlanet, but we've also seen with Strategy where they haven't really broken through and had that true iPhone moment that Saylor is talking about because the sale is not massive yet in terms of what their market is demanding and we don't know how that will also with respect to MetaPlanet's process, right?

**Khristina:**
(0:45:49) Like the fine print disclaimer in their presentation last night, you know, alluded to the process, which is in motion, but there's definitely steps of the process if they intend to list these products that have not commenced. And so, you don't know how long that process takes. So, even before we get to the distribution stage and can get these products sold, it's like, can they get these products listed? And so it's just a matter of a little bit of uncertainty in terms of the time frame, but I am confident that you know there's nothing Simon and Dylan are probably focused on nothing you know more important than this.

**Anders:**
(0:46:31) Yeah, absolutely. Zynx, SWC is it in your opinion the best risk-reward right now or top 10? What are we doing? What's your thoughts?

**Zynx:**
(0:46:38) That's top 10. That's very easy. So when it comes to you know what I'm I'm biased so I'll just put that out there and I think I have a good understanding of UK capital markets. So my insight is probably better than most especially compared to international investors. I'm very bullish on Smarter Web and the trajectory is clear. Like in my head, the vision to Footsie 250 is all but guaranteed and it's only a matter of time before it gets to Footsie 100. When he gets onto the Footsie 250, so much capital is going to come in. The stock is going to be tradable on, you know, a platform called Trading 212, which is where all the retail dens are on. And we've got the community for, you know, a real, you know, a real bubble here, but not in a bad way, but like, you know, for MNAV expansion to happen, there's lots of factors. With that being said, how I manage my portfolio, I limit, you know, when it comes to risk and when it comes to sizing, if you're dealing with, you know, decent amount of capital, I think risk adjusted because MetaPlanet is 10x the size of Smarter Web. You would have to say risk adjusted that MetaPlanet is less likely to go to zero. They've reached sort of an escape velocity where they've got to 25,000 Bitcoin and beyond where they're at 30,000 now and they've got the preferred the route is clear.

**Zynx:**
(0:48:13) With Smarter Web I'd say the risk comes it's decreasing by the day but it's getting to 25,000 Bitcoin to then get into the preferred which again I expect them to perform very very well in the UK especially with the distribution so and another company I like as well is Capital B. And outside of Strategy, these three companies I would say are the golden trio. With just how they're operating and so when it comes to risk adjusted, you know, it's hard. I'd probably say I would choose if you're dealing with a sizable portfolio, you wouldn't just when it comes to liquidity and stuff and trading volumes, you have to manage that. But if you asked me who would outperform in the stock price, 100% I'm choosing Smarter Web simply because of the size and scale and you know the path to the Footsie 250, Footsie 100. So if I've got £100,000 and I'm going for a punt, I'm putting that one in Smarter Web. But let's say if you're managing, you know, £10 million, it's a bit harder because of the size of the market cap, trading volume, liquidity. But yes, long story short, I like both. Smarter Web, not this is not financial advice. If I had to pick who will outperform between now and the end of the year, I definitely choose Smarter Web.

**Anders:**
(0:49:45) So speaking of risks if MNAV goes to one they're not big enough yet to launch the preferreds maybe or at least we know from Andrew and Jesse that it's expensive to launch the preferreds. It's a separate IPO in UK. What should SWC do if MNAV goes to one? How are they going to defend it at this time when they do not have preferreds? That's the only risk really I can see. I spoke with Ragna yesterday and it's like I've been saying the same thing that SWC is a little bit further out on the risk curve than MetaPlanet. It also has the higher reward there. But what risks are there? I can't see anything else then. What will they do when if MNAV goes to one?

**Zynx:**
(0:50:41) Good question. I say there's multiple things that the company can do. The first thing they can do, they can just sit and wait still because they have the benefit of having a profitable operating business. Of course, as expenses has increased, you know, they're going to need to expand that to keep up. But they've also got Smarter Convert, which again is a Bitcoin denominated bond. We've only seen this in the UK and in Europe where even if MNAV is at 0.8 what they can do is they can issue a Smarter Convert at a 30% premium which is again above a 1 MNAV. So they can take on leverage at an MNAV below one and still make it accretive to shareholders. Yeah, so they've got that in their locker. And I also think if MNAV did, you know, go below one for a sustained period of time, I'm sure, you know, I've said maybe run a CSP strategy that MetaPlanet have done, but they're still thinking about it. They're on the fence of that about it. You know, there's certain tax reasons. MetaPlanet had other catalysts to do, you know, Bitcoin cash secured puts. So, it's a difficult one. But definitely I'd say number one would be the Smarter Converts which allows them to accumulate Bitcoin accretively even if MNAV is trading below one.

**Anders:**
(0:52:10) Right? So let me ask you Zynx because I was thinking about that as well and then I was thinking well these Smarter Converts convert currently the existing one only 5% above the existing stock price. So I was thinking well it's like selling stock almost at MNAV 1 which is not very accretive but I guess what you're saying is that it is it's taking on leverage at a point where Bitcoin and the stock both likely are very suppressed and taking on leverage just means you have more upside. You move faster to the upside both directions.

**Zynx:**
(0:52:52) The worst thing no there's no downside. This is the beautiful thing about the Bitcoin denominated bonds. If they don't convert, they just give the Bitcoin back. Again, it's something I'm absolutely bewildered why we've not seen this in the US. We've not seen this around the world. Capital B deserve big props for this. It's honestly the best piece of financial engineering that I've seen in the space since Strategy. And yeah, so essentially the low premium at 5% and shorter duration was probably because Tobam got away with an amazing deal. You know, it was the first one for Smarter Web. But if you look at Capital B, they managed to have longer duration, you know, 5 years, 30% premium. And Andrew has already spoken that yeah when they plan to do another Smarter Convert they're going to perhaps look at extending the duration but also increasing the premium. So if MNAV was to go to 0.8 it's no problem they can still raise and buy Bitcoin you know accretively through Smarter Convert which again absolutely banging product in my opinion.

**Anders:**
(0:54:04) Great. And also, let's not forget that SWC in the quarter that just finished, SWC yielded according to their own numbers, 278%. So, it's almost a quadrupling of the SATs per stock. And I don't think that there's any treasury company that existed prior to Q3, came into Q3 with a base level of Bitcoin that have yielded that much. H100 is very close. I know Ragna has done some calculations where he's taking other things into account. There's warrants and I don't know which one is the 100% correct way of doing it, but it's that ballpark regardless, right? Like significantly above 200%. I could there's been no other treasury company yielding that much, right? Again, H100 very close in the most recent quarter. No.

**Zynx:**
(0:55:06) Yeah. And again, that says something about Andrew's I think execution and the demand in the local market, the community, right, Zynx?

**Zynx:**
(0:55:19) Yeah. And if you just look at the, you know, Bitcoin B Nick, he's got a website, you know, tracking all these things and he's got something called the Bitcoin accumulation race and it just shows you how much Bitcoin each company has gotten to after a certain amount of days. Smarter Web is by far the fastest. You know, it took them less than 3 months to get to 1,000 Bitcoin. It took MetaPlanet 6 months. Obviously, you know, conditions have changed and things are different now, but it just goes to show you that when the conditions are right, the team know how to strike and take advantage of the opportunity. When the IPO happened at the end of April, there was a raise week after week after week getting progressively bigger. 3 million, 6 million, 12 million, 21 million, 44 million. It was a remarkable 6 weeks. And you know if sentiment returns and trading volume returns with that ATM and you know LSE uplisting these guys will execute. Andrew will execute. I have the guy works harder than almost anyone in the space. If you call him he will chat to you. He'll email him. He will reply to you. You know he'll be up at midnight 1:00 a.m. He came back from an event. What event was it? Unconference in New York. And he went straight to a UK event on no sleep.

**Anders:**
(0:56:54) So Saylor said, didn't he that buying these equities, you're betting on people at the end of the day, you know, 100%. And you know, the similarities between... It's funny because Andrew's story needs to be more well known. You know, remember he was the head of online at HL, which is the UK's biggest, you know, broker, which is where he will then distribute his preferred, which is it's a beautiful story. But he created Smarter Web in 2009. This is his life's work. This is his legacy. This is where his wealth is tied up into. So, it's not just another payday. It's not just another opportunity. This is him now. And he's going to live and die by, you know, Smarter Web and it's his baby.

**Zynx:**
(0:57:36) So the energy is just different. How he cares about it in a way is similar to how Saylor cares about Strategy. They've been with their companies. They built it themselves. And you know that's why people are willing to get behind them.

**Anders:**
(0:58:01) Yeah. So with the yield, to me, what I actually I was excited going into Q3 because I want to see MetaPlanet yield compared to Capital B, compared to SWC. I guess at the time when we entered Q2, I mean, things are so rapid. I did not at the entry of Q3 hold SWC or H100. That was the 17th of June. I bought SWC. But for me entering again a new quarter, very excited to see how SWC will perform. H100, MetaPlanet and then Orange BDC that full disclaimer I'm advising will start trading mid next week in Brazil. They have 3,600 Bitcoin. Very excited obviously to see what can that market support there. So I think that those are probably the three that I expect the highest yield from having crossed a thousand Bitcoin or even 500 or maybe even 100 SWC, H100 and Orange BDC. Yeah, exciting exciting quarter. It's fun to be invested in this space despite the downturn. I think it's fun.

**Zynx:**
(0:59:26) It's amazing. When we talking about companies likely to reach 100,000 Bitcoin, if you think outside of the US and you look at the best capital markets, the UK is next, right? You know, London, you know, maybe not it's a, you know, it's not quite as high as it used to be, but it's still outside of New York. You know, maybe you got and then you've got Tokyo as well and Hong Kong. So, if you're going to bet on, you know, a capital market outside of the US, I think the route is clear and I you know, I'm totally backing Smarter Web to reach 100,000 Bitcoin and I think it's very very possible.

**Anders:**
(1:00:15) So, I think they will. Yeah, I agree. Like, in the bullish case I laid out early on on this stream and a lot of people have joined since then. Thank you to about 380 live viewers across X and YouTube. While Bitcoin can do a 200x, I see Smarter Web doing essentially a 6,000x in fiat terms from here to when Bitcoin reaches 200x from here around $25 million. If they reach half their target, if they reach their full target of 210,000 Bitcoin, that's a 12,000x. It's not every day you pass opportunities like that. It's probably worth a little bit of exposure, not financial advice, and everything can go to zero, right?

**Khristina:**
(1:01:06) But I do think too like as investors, you know, and you look across like the landscape of Bitcoin treasury companies, you know, there's definitely, you know, the narrative that there should be a Bitcoin treasury company in, you know, every region or multiple Bitcoin treasury companies in every region. But from an investor perspective, like it's my personal opinion that I don't need to own all of them, right? I'm going to own one, two, maybe three, the best. And over time maybe that concentrates further. But I do think having Bitcoin treasuries in different regions is important to help further educate and promote Bitcoin around the world, but I don't think you have to necessarily own everyone.

**Zynx:**
(1:02:00) Oh, agree. Avoid Canada. Sorry, guys. The Canadian equities do not touch.

**Khristina:**
(1:02:07) You know what? I've heard that before and outside of the Bitcoin treasury space so that's feedback that I have heard from other people in other sectors with respect to that particular market.

**Zynx:**
(1:02:24) I'm sorry, guys. That was unnecessary. But I just I've never touched a Canadian equity until this Bitcoin treasury thing and I just don't want to do it ever again.

**Anders:**
(1:02:38) Yeah, you got burned a little bit there and I know. Yeah.

**Zynx:**
(1:02:44) And also I think it's very important to when you're just not Canada but everywhere else is the in a way you want a jurisdiction that has mandated capital for that country so that it can't escape otherwise everyone would just you know flee to America right because you guys have the best companies and these sort of things whereas when I done my research into Canada is that the Canadian pension funds one of the largest ones had most of their investments in America so it's just like I don't think that sort of thing would run fully in the UK. There's a certain level of protectionism. We do have a lot of investments of course in the US but there is mandated funds which is very very important because that's the trapped pool of capital that these companies can...

**Anders:**
(1:03:35) You see he said can't buy SWC on Trading 212. Now when SWC uplists to the London Stock Exchange then the stock will be available to buy on Trading 212 and this is the most popular sort of new school 20s and 30s would be using that platform. The only thing with that is so what I wrote in the chat when I saw that open a new account somewhere else maybe I mean if you want to buy now because between here and the uplisting not financial advice and it may not happen but it is on the in within the realms of possibilities that SWC does 3x 4x before that happens right not saying it will. But I'm such a FOMO investor. Once I see something, I can't sit on the sidelines. I need to own it ASAP. And dollar cost averaging is very hard for me. So yeah, what else should we... We've been going for a little bit more than an hour. I'm loving this. I'm having fun. We have covered all the points that I had written up beforehand but take it away with if there's further points you guys want to get across Khristina and Zynx.

**Khristina:**
(1:04:54) I think we covered it from my perspective.

**Zynx:**
(1:05:00) Yeah, I'd say that's pretty much everything. Just don't underestimate how much of a local champion SWC is, how, you know, well regarded Andrew is, how well regarded Jesse is, how people appreciate the execution, the commitment to Smarter Web, how strong the community is. Strongest on X. So much goodwill is there and also don't fade the eventual preferred in the long run the UK is primed for a Bitcoin-backed fixed income product and for those concerned about the UK political situation like I said this will not affect Smarter Web whatsoever worst case scenario the company will just go to one of our autonomous overseas territories and headquarter there and pay no tax. So overall things are looking good for Smarter Web.

**Anders:**
(1:06:02) Absolutely. And can I I'm going to plug my... Yes. And I'm gonna do it by saying what do you guys want to share here as a final comments and thoughts and I want you Zynx to talk about your new initiative. But let's go ladies first and then stick around for what Zynx is working on. How about that?

**Khristina:**
(1:06:28) Would just say have conviction in what you own. Be patient. V feels great on the way up, super painful on the way down. But I don't think, you know, the good times are over for good. I think, we're definitely going to have, days where things start to look a lot better across the sector.

**Zynx:**
(1:06:54) Yeah, I agree completely. Just renew your conviction every so often and no crying at the casino.

**Anders:**
(1:07:01) Love it. I love that one. Stefan Lea told me that in Prague. I never heard it before, but I love it. No crying in the casino.

**Zynx:**
(1:07:07) Yeah, just leverage Bitcoin equity. You get the volatility, the price you pay for the outsized returns, right?

**Anders:**
(1:07:19) Yeah. All right. Zynx. What are you working on? Exciting. Both me and Khristina, I love the idea of what you're what you started just within a few days ago and we spoke about it in the Saturday. Tell us.

**Zynx:**
(1:07:32) So, I launched Sovereign 21, which is a play of, you know, being a sovereign individual. I'm not sure if you guys read that book, but it's a famous British book. All Bitcoiners would love it. And initially the idea came up from these Bitcoin denominated bonds. Actually, I wanted to do one and put in a couple, you know, not too much, but like a couple million into a Smarter Convert or into Capital B. But the problem was that for these companies, it wouldn't have been worth it. So my idea was, okay, well, we need to get some Bitcoiners together. Let's say if there's 10 of us, okay, that's $20 million or $10 million, then it becomes worth it for the company. And then that snowballed into a wider thing. I started talking with other Bitcoiners quite prominent you know people on X and came to the idea that actually there's no private you know investor network for Bitcoiners in the world that's focused on Bitcoin treasury companies native Bitcoin businesses and you know or simply just profitable businesses that put Bitcoin on the balance sheet and there was a real demand for you know that community with you know motivated individuals let's just say motivated Bitcoiners to create this and yeah you know it's currently got I think 54 members now very you know names that you would all know we've got doctors hedge fund owners head of Bitcoin strategy for one of the companies we've got high net worth individuals just lots of prominent people in the space and the goal is eventually you know, if it's a thousand people, 5,000 people, get a Saylor involved, president of El Salvador involved, it would turn into some sort of decentralized VC where companies can come and just pitch themselves to the group. You as a sovereign individual, if you want to get involved or not, it's up to you. And more importantly, over the next 10 years, a lot of wealth is going to be created. You know, if you're rich now, you're going to be super rich in 10 years. If you're involved as a Bitcoiner in the Bitcoin treasury space, if you're pre-rich, you're going to be rich. Simply, you know, just a lot of wealth is going to be created. So, a part of it is also philanthropy. You know, if there's a thousand, 2,000, 3,000 well motivated Bitcoiners with a lot of capital. Current net worth assets under management is roughly, you know, well over $300 million. Now in 10 years time in a bigger network with a 10x on Bitcoin that could be what $100 billion worth of net worth between you know a thousand people 2,000 people and the good that we can change in the world with that it's you know it sounds pretty cool to me a lot of people liked it so I was like you know what let's just do it and it's called Sovereign 21 you can I think it's fantastic.

**Khristina:**
(1:10:46) I think it sounds like since you're going to have to dox yourself at some point.

**Zynx:**
(1:10:51) No, I don't want to do that. That's the thing. If you're like starting this whole business with all of these people, you're going to probably have to like, you know, anyone who wants to lead the in-person stuff and wants to do that, you can do it and you'll get paid for it. I don't want to. I'm good. I just wanted to build the network and be the admin. There is a 50% affiliate link for everyone that if you join and you got a friend to join, you can you know it's it's this is not going to make a dent in humbly in my net worth. But I'm thinking in the long term collectively if there's a thousand 2,000 3,000 people and you know Bitcoin's at a million a coin then in a sense it's almost like a virtual network state of well motivated Bitcoiners and you know who knows maybe we'll fund new businesses together start new ones the community is already active people are meeting each other new initiatives maybe we'll fund a coffee shop that runs on Bitcoin in Indonesia or a new treasury company in South Africa. There's lots of possibilities with a well motivated network of like-minded people. So yeah, read my pinned post if you're interested.

**Anders:**
(1:12:19) And if people want to go sign up, what's the domain name?

**Zynx:**
(1:12:25) So currently it's on School platform. We're currently building our website but currently if School so skool.com/sovereign21 and it should come up. Or you can just go to my Twitter bio. It's in there. Again demand has been you know I wasn't expecting it to be like this. And a lot of people, a lot of Bitcoiners have a lot of wealth already. And I think they're just looking to do something with it. And you can only imagine over the next 10 years, you know, the future is ours. The future belongs to Bitcoiners. So that's the purpose.

**Anders:**
(1:13:10) Amen. Yeah. Excited for that. I may have to join your club there.

**Zynx:**
(1:13:20) Honestly, everyone's welcome. You'll love it for sure.

**Anders:**
(1:13:26) Oh, it's 79 bucks per month. There is other perks as well. It's not just a network, of course, that is the main value proposition, but I will be producing like a monthly Bitcoin treasury report. I'm going to make it the best in the world. Have macro analysis and also there will be like a spotlight section at the end for any members in the community. If you got any interesting business proposals or initiatives, you know, I can put that in there. There's so many things with having a well motivated network. But yeah, I'll stop shilling now. Sorry guys, had to be done.

**Anders:**
(1:13:59) No, it's fantastic. Fantastic. I love the potential end game or part of the game being charity.

**Zynx:**
(1:14:12) Yeah, that's definitely will be a big part of it. So yeah, appreciate that.

**Anders:**
(1:14:19) So, yeah, no, thank you very much both, Khristina and Zynx. Another great show, I think we did together here, a quick shout out to John Harpur that I learned in the chat today has ancestors from Denmark. So shout out to you, John. Thank you guys. And thank you for the what are we at more than 400 live viewers across X and YouTube. Thank you for joining. There'll be more content likely I guess this week in the treasury space from my account but definitely next week. So thank you for tuning in. Thank you for participating in the chat. Also, special shout out to the wonderful community of SWC, which we all love here. And yeah, see you soon.

**Khristina:**
