**Host (Charles):**
(0:00:00) Intro & Year-End Price Targets for Top 3 BTC Treasury Companies. Zynx, welcome to Proof of Thought podcast. Very happy to have you here with us today.

**Zynx:**
(0:00:08) Thank you very much for having me on, Charles.

**Host:**
(0:00:15) Wonderful. Well, let's dive right into it. What are your year-end price targets for your top three Bitcoin Treasury picks and what makes you believe they can reach those targets?

**Zynx:**
(0:00:27) So, the thing with these price targets is it's very hard to pick a number because it depends on what MNAV premium you're giving them. So, if they're trading at two MNAV, 3x MNAV, 5x MNAV, um, and of course, how much Bitcoin that they stack as well, and then also the Bitcoin price at the end of year. So, it's it's actually very complicated to give a specific price target. Um, but I would give an example. So, my top three picks would be strategy, MetaPlanet, and Smarter Web/CapitalB. Um, those four, I know you said three, but those four are definitely the best players right now in my opinion that, you know, I have my larger positions in. Um, but MetaPlanet, I'll give a price target for MetaPlanet with all those things taken into consideration. um you know, let's say if Bitcoin gets to around $200,000, um and it's trading between, you know, three to five MNAV, you know, potentially we could see MetaPlanet trade anything from, you know, 60 to to $80. Um obviously that's really really high from where it is now. You know, just over a 10x, but you know, it's hard to formulate a price prediction. Like I said it, so many different things play into, you know, what the price is going to be. But yeah, that's how I answer that question.

**Host:**
(0:02:00) Okay, so you're factoring in what the multiple to NAV would be, your price prediction for Bitcoin itself, which is the underlying underlying asset that they hold. Um, and then would a third factor as well be the amount they are actually holding. So what you think their growth rate will be in terms of uh how much Bitcoin they actually hold?

**Zynx:**
(0:02:16) Yeah, definitely. So obviously the BTC yield and then you also got to take into consideration the share dilution as well. Um because obviously you know if they're diluting at a 5 mnav for the rest of the year that's obviously going to be highly accretive and it's going to be you know even better for the share price but if that if it's at 2 mnav then it's going to be different. So there's so many moving parts towards this that you know I can definitely say I'm confident that the price is going to be a lot higher than it is today. Um you know assuming they continue to stack Bitcoin and that the Bitcoin price continue to goes up. Uh every Bitcoin purchase the NAV of these companies increases. So the floor rises after every purchase and these companies that I mentioned they're buying Bitcoin every week. So the floor for these companies, you know, is rising every single day. Well, not every single day, but every single week. So yeah, that's pretty much hard answer that question.

**Host:**
(0:03:20) That makes sense. And do you think um you know, on a relative basis, I guess, relative to how much Bitcoin they already hold, um one of these companies will be able to accumulate more on their own. So have a faster growth rate, right? probably not strategy, right? Because it's already so large on a relative basis, it probably won't accumulate as as much. But it seems like you think MetaPlanet with those price targets you gave uh will acquire very quickly through the end of the year. Um but how about Smarter Web and the blockchain group? How do you think those stack up against each each other?

**Zynx:**
(0:04:02) Yeah. So the you know this is still being debated as to what is more desirable but obviously the smaller companies their BTC yield every quarter can be far higher because they're starting off with less Bitcoin. Obviously if you go from two Bitcoin to say 10 Bitcoin that's a 400% BTC yield but then other people will say well that's just you know base effect you know maths bias absolute numbers mean something. So even though strategy have, you know, their massive amount of Bitcoin, if they're accumulating, let's say, a thousand Bitcoin every week, that's still far more in absolute terms than a company that's accumulating far less, but their BTC yield will look better. So with MetaPlanet, I think they're in, you know, escape velocity. They're in that zone where they've accumulated a decent amount of Bitcoin, but they're very much on the exponential curve now where, you know, they're accumulating Bitcoin faster and faster, especially um with the moving strike warrants that they've that they're currently doing. Uh Smarter Web, they're just an earlier stage MetaPlanet for me. um they went from, you know, having no Bitcoin to just over 2,100 uh in the space of just over 3 months. Um from 0 on the balance sheet to over 200 million. Um so things are moving really quickly. And in CapitalB as well, they've been buying Bitcoin every week. And so it depends because the market is still figuring it out. But I would say that you know the smaller the smaller companies that are stacking Bitcoin on a regular basis and their BTC yield is attractive. Um I would suggest or in my opinion that they will probably have bigger gains but at some point I don't know when the market will have to you know recognize that you know strategy you know in this finite game in this zero sum game that strategy do have you know the most amount of bitcoin and every thousand dollar increase you know the amount of money that is accumulating on their balance sheet is far more significant than all these other companies put together. Um, so if you if you're interested in Bitcoin treasury companies and you want to spread your bet, you know, it depends on your risk tolerance. But for me personally, you know, strategy is my base and then MetaPlanet and then you're moving along the risk curve with each of these companies. I wouldn't go beyond these companies. Um, because you don't know if their flywheel is going to actually continue or get off the ground. Um, but you know, it depends on what your risk tolerance is and you know, how you see things.

**Host:**
(0:06:44) Yeah. Uh yeah. No. Uh great great perspective there. Um and yes, the blockchain group is now uh capital. That's that's correct. Um but let's let's fast forward a little bit here. You know, let's say we get through the end of the year. You know, Bitcoin somewhere between pretty large range here, but I'm just going to say 150 to 250,000. We know these companies are going to continue to stack. they're going to um you know expand their Bitcoin holdings um and produce uh a Bitcoin yield. Um but what's your plan during and just you know scenario planning here. What's your plan during a Bitcoin and crypto bear market where a 20 to 40% draw down in Bitcoin could potentially lead to a 40 to 80% draw down in any of these treasury companies.

**Zynx:**
(0:07:36) So I would say that for me personally I don't really like to trade too much. Um when I invest you know I'm investing for a time horizon of you know 5 years plus. So if there is you know a 20 to 40% draw down and these companies do see MNAV contraction which they have done in you know the last couple of months especially in the last months then I will just continue to add more to my positions um with the companies that I believe will survive and continue to add bitcoin to their balance sheet. So the beautiful thing about these sort of companies is that they are not uh adding leverage to their balance sheet. Um they sorry really low levels of leverage to their balance sheet. You know they don't have debt per se or high levels of debt. So it's not what we've seen in previous cycles where you know all these companies all these altcoins and all these other associated cryptocurrency companies have you know a ton of leverage built in and you know it's a house of cards once it collapses and that's it. It's never coming back. These companies are very robust um the ones that I've mentioned and so if there is a draw down I will just add to my positions and wait for it to come back. That's simply how I do it. I don't trade my Bitcoin either. You know, only add, only buy. And, you know, I've I've experienced the volatility with Bitcoin. So, you know, over these last 10 plus years, and it doesn't phase me anymore. So, I I some people would try to time it. You can, you know, sell if the market uh these um if you see Bitcoin going down and you think, you know, we're about to enter a bear market, then if you can time it and you can trade it, good for you. Um, but yeah, I I I personally I'm I'm not doing that.

**Host:**
(0:09:27) Yeah, you you personally, you're an investor, not a trader, have at least a 5-year time horizon, and like you said, if you you've experienced Bitcoin over the past 10 years, uh, you're you're used to these draw downs, and it sounds like you you have a good plan to to deal with that. Um, great. Well, well, let's move on a bit here. I've talked about this before on the podcast in terms of uh these BTC treasury companies actually instead of uh them being you know direct competitors um like you would traditionally think of uh different businesses that are in the same industry um there are a lot of synergies there as well right if you know more of these companies are buying Bitcoin price of Bitcoin's going up the value of that Bitcoin on strategy's balance sheet on MetaPlanet's balance sheet will also go up uh but I could see um you know why there potentially be a conflict of interest there um with having multiple of uh these companies um in the same region. Uh for the reason that you know um the having these companies in these regions often gives access to certain investors in that region who may not be able to you know invest in Bitcoin in traditional ways and so these companies are their only way to to onboard it. Um, but at a higher level though, I do still see this this overall synergy of having multiple companies. So, I'm wondering if maybe they initially had thought about it in that way and they didn't necessarily see it as direct competition. Um, but maybe once you and some others raise those points, you know, they're like, hey, maybe maybe uh, you know, in terms of regional BTC treasury companies, at least to start, um, we it's better to just back one that can help onboard folks in that region, right?

**Zynx:**
(0:11:09) So, Smarter Web and MetaPlanet, they're not competitors. It's a competition where, like you said, it's the synergy. They're both buying Bitcoin. They're helping each other's bags, but they're drawing from two completely different capital pools. So, smarter web is not competing with strategy in the US or, you know, and and we're not competing as say we as a shareholder. I have a I'm a shareholder in smart web, meta planet, and strategy. Um, Smart Web is not competing with MetaPlanet. You know, we we're not smarter web is not accessing, you know, the same pools of capital that MetaPlanet are doing in Japan. Um, but the problem is within the same market, you know, within London, um, obviously it's the same capital that ultimately they're competing for. And then when you've got things like the, uh, preferred, they're going to be tackling the same fixed income market. And then there's also things like you know certain ideas you know IP that the companies will have and obviously it gets a bit it gets a bit messy when it's you know conflated and also this Satsuma company are now marketing themselves in a way that is potentially disparaging of smart web. So you know they're considering themselves to be okay smarter web have done well with the retail investors but we're here for the institutions and now it's just like okay so now it's a competition and people are talking spicy so it's just like and the reason why UTXO are doing these deals by the way is because how they are structured they get in at the very very base level. So, for example, in in this Satsuma deal, they invested, you know, I think a couple million of dollars or whatever at 0.2. Okay. 0.2 P. Then they did this big institutional raise at one pence. So, they're already 5x on their position. The current stock price, the last time I checked it, for this company where it's trading at is at 3 p. So, they're already up 15x before anything's even happened. And that's how, you know, this is why they they do these deals. If you look into it, you know, that's how the money is made. The money isn't made joining these companies now. It's when before, you know, they even bought their their Bitcoin, you see. So, yeah.

**Host:**
(0:13:45) Well, at least at least the big money some money can be made after the factor, right? We know strategy shareholders have done MetaPlanet shareholders did phenomenally um even after the initial raise. But you did mention something very interesting that I wanted to uh ask you just two questions about. You mentioned I believe you were an early private investor in smarter web company. Um first question is like how do you get access to a deal like that if you're comfortable sharing and then second one is around um you did also mentioned that you don't like to get into deals early that aren't at the same um level as uh what retail would have access to. So how was that deal structured um so that you didn't have a fair advantage or an unfair advantage um over retail?

**Zynx:**
(0:14:31) So the smarter web IPO was not private, it was public but what it was obviously limited to investors in the UK and it was given and announced on like three brokers I think the largest in the UK uh HL AJ Bell and I think it was available on Interactive Investors. So these were the biggest like brokerage companies in the UK and what they did was they announced it in advance you know the IPO is happening and every anyone if they wanted to in the UK or even I don't know outside the UK but in the UK you could have got involved. So but at that point the price was 2.5p and this was the price that UTXO got in at as well. um that's what the price that their warrants are at as well. So that's more fair. I think over time obviously they have seen the success and I don't want to say it's greed but let's just say there's less piece of the cake for everyone else to get involved. Um and I'm not you know criticizing them. I don't mind them making money or whatever. The Smarter Web IPO is very different to all these other deals because we could, you know, get involved. Um, retail investors could get involved and it wasn't just limited to, you know, high net worth individuals. I'm sorry, what was the second question?

**Host:**
(0:16:02) No, you you answered it. How'd you get access, right? And then what made it uh the same level playing field for um you know institutions and and retail which you you hit on which is awesome and smarter web company went on to be one of the best performing treasury companies. So like you'd wonder why more companies don't do it this way. I mean it probably really ignited the retail base behind this company.

**Zynx:**
(0:16:28) Yeah. you see with these SPACs and these companies um like Sequins for example um what happened was obviously the share price ran up but then there was a huge unlocking of this you know of these shares and it just causes the share price to just cuz they all get out um and that's the problem people just dump their shares because they've already bought in really really low and and that's why me personally I like uh these deals or buying companies once I know all the information all these SPACs to be honest this is why they don't trade at high MNAVs because the MNAV premium is given to these companies by retail investors really you know it's all about sentiment the reason why smart web does really well is because Andrew the CEO has a policy of no discounted raises so as an investor and you know for the little guys for retail they're like you know what that's cool that you can trust him and he's building a base around him. Outside of strategy and meta planet, Smart Web have the largest X community. Um, you know, he he's almost become a local cult hero, you know, for a lot of these people. Um, and that's how obviously you get the high MN navs and then that's even more accretive for these companies. And yeah, I'm still unsure about these big SPAC deals that going on in the US. And I don't know if, you know, they're going to get the MNAVs that they want. Uh, we've seen ProCap, we've seen a few others, and right now they I don't think any of them are trading at MNAV above two, but don't quote me on that.

**Host:**
(0:18:08) Yeah. Yeah. I think uh they've they've been very volatile as they've been in this waiting period to have their SPACs um approved um so that they can move forward with the strategy. But I think um in the most recent weeks, a lot of them have uh sort of reverted back to that initial $10 uh or closer to that $10 um SPAC price. Um you you were kind of hitting on this a bit, but are there other ways you think that um incentives can be better aligned so that these initial early investors don't just dump their shares on retail? Or what would you like to, you know, if you if you could kind of design the world, what would you like to um see going forward um to have incentives be better aligned?

**Zynx:**
(0:18:55) You know what, it's it is hard because it depends. I'm aware that my opinion doesn't necessarily mean it's the best way forward and I know that people are okay with different things. Some would argue well as long as the capital is here that's all that matters that's going into Bitcoin. Um for me personally and perhaps this is just because this is how it's I've seen it happen in the UK and and it's worked for smart web is that you can offer these deals but as long as retail can get involved with them as well. So then it's not unequal access to already rich individuals and institutions. Then I'm okay with whatever you want to do as long as retail get access to that. But then you know some would say that maybe I'm being too idealistic and this is just the reality of you know capital markets. But I'm all about breaking rules and I you know we're bitcoiners at the end of the day. Um so me personally you know I've been offered these sort of type of deals. Um, and I just rather buy my shares at, you know, if it's a placing that is at the market closed price, then yes. Um, there was actually um a company called H100 with uh a CEO, you know, Anderson. He did a private placing that was 10% or something around that below the market close price. And I actually, you know, called him out on it on X. I said, "Why are you guys doing this? You're already a premium company. H100." At that point, they had already been mentioned in a keynote speech by Saylor himself and, you know, so much going for themselves. Adam Backs involved and um and but he was actually really receptive and you know messaged me and he in the end what he done was going forward instead of doing these discounted raises he made it either an average of the last five trading days or at the market close price and if you actually see what's happened to their community now on X the shareholder base is far more enthused you know it's far more respectable way of doing business. And I I now think they're going to do amazingly well and I am a shareholder now in that company because a lot of this is betting on the people. And trust me, just because all these Bitcoin treasury companies are coming about, they're they're not all the same. Saylor will will die on this hill, you know, for for for Bitcoin and for his company. To others, it's just opportunity. And trust me, that's that's a big difference. And it's important to look out for that.

**Host:**
(0:21:31) Absolutely. No, it seems so obvious to me to just put your shareholders first, you know, and you the number of companies that have done that. Um, they've managed to perform the best. They've managed to build the most engaged and active community. Exactly. So, um, it seems like a no-brainer. All right. And I'm wondering there with the Nakamoto company that David Bailey is now running publicly that's doing uh very similar work to what he did at UTXO Management, the private hedge fund, if that will now if if that will now essentially be a vehicle for in a way for um retail investors or folks who want to invest um in these various deals across these different regions if that's a way for them to gain access to it. probably not at the same discounted level because Nakamoto is already traded at a pretty big premium. Uh but if the stock were to ever reverse or be undervalued, could be a good opportunity um to pick up shares in a company that's going to continue to seed.

**Zynx:**
(0:22:29) Listen, listen, listen, listen to it. Let's do it. Yeah. If David, Tyler, you're listening to this, listen. I don't hate you guys. We're all cool. We're all good. But me personally, this is not financial advice, but definitely wait until these unlocks and these, you know, PIPE investors get their shares. That's just my advice because inevitably you're going to get an unlocking and you're going to get people selling their shares at premium. And I do not touch any company that has these big PIPE investors and investments. You you saw what happened with Sequins, you know. Um I you know I I yeah I just wouldn't get involved right now. But I do believe that Nakamoto their business structure of seeding. So, it looks like they're going to inherit the UTXO playbook, seeding all these companies and then rotating a lot of that into Bitcoin, selling these shares when these BTC treasuries, you know, eat up their local fixed income markets. Sounds like a good idea for sure. Um, but just be careful and read the details and your timings because

**Host:**
(0:23:52) Yeah, absolutely. No, great point. uh definitely have to pay attention to the details, the fine print. Um and you definitely don't uh not not definitely but you know you probably don't want to be in the way of uh unlocks from investors who uh invested at a huge discount to what the price is currently trading on. So um very important point there uh for folks to do their research and be careful about that. Uh but Zynx, this is this has been great. you you know you publicly have called out uh uh various Treasury company leaders on X like you've talked about uh in a very uh substantive way uh when you've seen or sensed that they weren't playing fair uh which led to some real change being made at those companies benefiting um uh you know variety of shareholders. Um what are some of your key takeaways uh from these experiences and and what have you learned?

**Zynx:**
(0:24:46) Um, I've learned that I'm very passionate about upholding the Bitcoin values, uh, and and the principles of the Bitcoin network. I've also learned that as ever, there's always going to be a lot of shady characters and chancers. you know, we we seen it with, you know, the ICOs in 2017 and then you've got all these altcoins, you've got, you know, NFTs and all there's always every cycle there's always always something new. Exactly. And um you know whilst it's great and I believe that it's just a natural progression of hyper bitcoinization that these bitcoin treasury companies you know coming about. Not all of they're not all the same and there's some that are definitely far better than others. So yeah, I think I just want to see what I call best practices. And um I've, you know, if I see wrong, I want to try to correct it. And to be fair, a lot of these CEOs and executives have been receptive. And like I said, I mentioned Anderson from H100. He changed it and and he benefits from it. It's funny because um a lot of these people are trying to copy the Saylor flywheel, but it relies heavily on the retail investors to give you this MNAV premium. If you go below one MNAV, how are you going to defend your MNAV if your operating business makes no money? What are you going to do? You're going to you're going to be in trouble. And you know, unless you can figure it out and unless you know, investors are happy with you, you know, and it's it's free marketing. If you treat your base well, they will spread the word on X. They will create all this content. Some of these X community groups, so much alpha, more than any hedge fund, you know, private equity firm, you know, you've had Climber on here. He does phenomenal work and that's he is in well, he's, you know, the MetaPlanet Dojo community. You know, you've got other contributors, you know, Hyoko. Look at the MSTR True North guys. you know, that's all all comes from the community that drives, you know, sentiment and all this comes from is by being right to your shareholders and and not doing them dirty. And but there unfortunately there is some that you know are like that. And yeah, so if I see it and I have knowledge of it, I'll I'll call it out.

**Host:**
(0:27:18) Yeah, that's that's wonderful. Um and you mentioned you you learned that you're really passionate about this work. um what do you see as your plan to keep this up going forward or how do you see your activism work um and what you're doing evolving over time and also how can others support your initiative here to help benefit all other shareholders?

**Zynx:**
(0:27:37) I I would just say to if you see anything wrong or you know just remember the values of the Bitcoin network and you know remember why we do all of this. Um you know keep that at the core of your mission and you should be okay. As for me um I have only recently started to post on X. I've had an account since like 2016. I've been in the Bitcoin space since like 2015. Um, I've been a Bitcoiner since 2015, but it's only recently that I've decided to step into the light. At some point, I probably will um dox myself and, you know, come out because I I'm a found I'm the founder of Bitcoin Vote UK, which is an initiative that I set up to, you know, put Bitcoin on the ballot box at the next general election in the UK. right now. Unfortunately, we're we're we're a cycle behind you guys. Um the politicians are very comfortable disrespecting Bitcoin, dismissing it. And the point of Bitcoin Vote UK is to, you know, really, you know, change that. And, you know, if these politicians want to continue to take such a hostile stance, then we will set up and we will organize and campaign against you. You know, the Bitcoin lobby is only getting stronger and stronger. We're just getting wealthier and wealthier, you know, and we're very dogmatic. We're very we will we we will be one issue voters and you know you will pay the price really. So you either get on board and understand that Bitcoin is the best for society and it's the best asset ever created or we will compel you to that position regardless because these politicians only serve themselves anyways. So that's what I'm working on. Bitcoin Vote UK. We've got seven key policy demands and yeah, it's part of my wider activism. I'm also obviously interested in Bitcoin itself and you know the Bitcoin treasury space. So yeah, my content should only continue an increase in output.

**Host:**
(0:29:53) Interesting. Well, when you do finally reveal yourself, uh you know, you're you're always uh you'll be welcomed back on on this show. Um so um that that'll be great. But let's uh let's circle back to these BTC treasury companies uh you know and and close with that. Um I'm curious what uh idiosyncratic risk uh do these companies have and what risk are you paying attention to when it comes to the broader uh BTC treasury market?

**Zynx:**
(0:30:24) So I would say the risks when it comes to these BTC treasury companies is just you know are they overleveraging themselves if they are leveraging themselves are they using you know smart leverage are they doing it in the correct way we just seen you know in Europe actually I've not seen this anywhere else but we've had Bitcoin convertible bonds where uh it's denominated in BTC and these are very very interesting. I've not seen this anywhere else. First it was with CapitalB formerly known as the blockchain group. Then we seen it with H100, you know, Swedish company and now we've seen it in the UK with smarter converts, smart web. And that's a form of in, you know, intelligent leverage and yeah, make sure they they have operating businesses that are profitable so that if there is a bear market and they, you know, for whatever reason they can survive, they don't have to rely on selling their Bitcoin. And then, you know, the team, you have to believe in the team, the CEOs, you know, are they Bitcoin maxis? Is it just an opportunity for them or do they actually believe in the long-term vision of Bitcoin? Um, and I like to stick to rich capital markets just because, you know, the local fixed income market is big enough for them to, you know, eat up. So, the total addressable market um has to be of a good size. And yeah, the these are just the sort of things. It's hard because the space is still developing, but if you do your research, you look at the warrants, you look at the share options, you look at, you know, the seed funding, the PIPE investments, these sort of things you have to take into consideration. Um, I like to read a lot of documents and yeah, I just say do your due diligence because they're not all like each other and there's definitely some scams out there.

**Host:**
(0:32:20) Yeah. Well, I appreciate you talking about the risk you see and some of the other factors uh that you pay attention to. Um I'm curious a little bit more about the qualitative features of these uh companies and and what you look uh you look for as you're evaluating them. Um I know you talked about for example with the smarter web company. You know they have a very large X community as well as some of these other uh treasury plays. Um but you've also talked about the um you know the importance of having a really strong team and one that will will do right for shareholders. Um what other factors do you look for though uh from a qualitative perspective?

**Zynx:**
(0:32:59) Good marketing. Is there anything else? Um not really because I think it's just the proof is in the pudding. You know the proof of work is is is is just there. Are they buying Bitcoin? Are they doing it at an acceptable pace? Is the BTC yield good? You know, are they able to raise capital? Because it's very easy to buy Bitcoin, you know, can you raise money? You know, um so it's just these sort of things. I don't think it has to be too complicated, you know, is their flywheel actually turning spinning because some of these companies will raise capital and then you won't hear from them for another 2 3 months. look at trading volumes and you know it's a winner takes most market in my opinion. So I don't invest in multiple Bitcoin treasury companies in the same market. Perhaps the US has room for this because obviously the capital markets is far deeper there. But that's it really. I I I don't really assess for anything else um than what I what I've said really.

**Host:**
(0:34:02) Yeah. And that's interesting um about only investing. you're only investing in one company in those markets because someone else might look at it and say, "Okay, if I know there's only going to be one winner, maybe I'll just diversify my bets." You know, maybe so your your risk comes down. Um uh you know, the reward also won't be as big. Um but at least you're not putting all of your eggs in one basket. But I guess from your perspective, um it sounds like you're really big on doing your uh due diligence research um really thoroughly upfront um and and wanting to make uh uh a big wager on, you know, who might win in that specific market. It seems like you've been right choosing a smart web company uh in the UK and a plan in Japan. So,

**Zynx:**
(0:34:46) well, yeah, that's you can spread your risk and you can diversify, but I'm doing that over different jurisdictions. So fine, if I chose a wrong winner in in in the UK, well, I've chose the winner in Japan. I've chose the winner in the US. I've chose the winner in France. So, you know, and and you know, if I do miss the winner, well, they're buying Bitcoin anyways, and I've got Bitcoin in cold storage, so they're buying up my bags. They they're putting capital into the uh Bitcoin network anyways. So, you know, you're not going to catch every horse and you know, spread it over jurisdictions. With that being said though, really and truly, you can just stick to strategy meta planet and you'll be good to go. Um, stick stick with just Bitcoin and you'll be good to go. So, it all just depends really how

**Host:**
(0:35:33) Sorry, what was the last part there you said?

**Zynx:**
(0:35:38) Oh, oh, I said or just stick to Bitcoin if you if you Yeah, exactly. don't want to do, you know. So, makes sense. Sometimes, uh, you know, just keeping it simple is the best way to go. Um but yeah, as we wrap here, you know, you mentioned earlier you dislike that some companies had offered discounted uh fundraising. Um you've also mentioned some other things that um you look to avoid and uh others should think about avoiding as well. Um are there any other red flags um that um we should be paying attention to here as uh these uh more and more of these uh BTC treasury companies come to market?

**Zynx:**
(0:36:12) um look into the history of the people that are leading these companies. Um I don't know if it's similar in the US or other jurisdictions but in the UK we've got this thing called companies house which is like a government record of all the companies someone has been a part of you know as directors or CEOs or registered companies and um we've actually got over 20 Bitcoin treasury companies announced in the UK now. Um there was a flurry after seeing the success of smarter web and literally a lot of these companies like you you just click through the people who are running it. Oh you've got 40 companies that are now dissolved. Um you know so just do your due diligence man and and be sensible with your allocations. You don't have to win tomorrow you know just expand your time horizon. You can win over the next 5 10 years. If you're here and if you're listening to this, you're going to win anyways if you're sensible. You know, I always say that within the next 5 years, by 2030, if you're here today and you're not rich or you you're not at least having the option to choose the work that you want to do, then then you know, you've effed up. You've you've you've made bad choices. So, yeah.

**Host:**
(0:37:39) I love it. I love it. Let's let's let's end with that. Uh, Zynx, where can uh the the good people go to find you and uh keep up with uh your work?

**Zynx:**
(0:37:46) I appreciate it, Charles. I appreciate you having me on. And they can just find me on X at Zynx BTC. And yeah, that that will be where I'm at for now. Soon I'm going to expand. I have a little YouTube channel, but I haven't posted in like 3 years. It's funny because I did a price prediction video in 2022 and it's tracked pretty well. Um, but I I I plan to expand my content there on YouTube, Zynx BTC X, Twitter, Zynx BTC, and I'm going to probably create a substack too at some point. Um, but yeah, that's where you can find me. Um, appreciate you having me on and yeah, you keep up the good work, too.

**Host:**
(0:38:26) Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it. And just curious, what uh what year was that price target for? Was it for 2024, 2025? So, it actually went out to 2030.

**Zynx:**
(0:38:39) Oh, wow. Um, and I I'll give you some of the numbers here actually, if you bear with me. So, yeah. So, it 2022, this was made 2022, February the 19th. Uh, I'll give it in USD bear market. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. In a bear market. So for my 2024 prediction, so 2022 I predicted 54K, 2023 just under 74K, 2024 100K, 2025 136,000. um the 20 it's it's been pretty accurate and my calculation was a 36% CAGR all the way up to 2030 and um you know at 2030 the last price prediction is at 636,000 USD but I think at the time I was mainly basing it off the GBP price the British pound and I think the US dollar has definitely weakened so you can put that to around 700 to 750K USD, I think. But a lot of people be like, "That's bearish." But I like to be I like to be conservative.

**Host:**
(0:39:54) Exactly. When you're dealing with I mean, if you go from 100,000 to 700,000 within five years, I mean, like you said, so um we'll check back in on those numbers in a couple years. Um, but again, great having you on and I think like you said, anyone who's listening already and who's sensible about what they'll go ahead and do, um, uh, is already a winner. Um, so thanks for, uh, sharing your insights with us today. Really appreciate having you on with us. Cheers.

**Zynx:**
(0:40:19) Thank you, man. Appreciate it. All right. Cheers. Take care. Thank you. You as well.
