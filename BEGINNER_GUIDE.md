## How to Write Good Questions

The better your question, the better the answer! Here are some tips:

### ✅ DO:

- **Be specific:** "What did Andrew Webley say about Bitcoin in November 2025?" (better than "What did he say?")
- **Include dates when relevant:** "What was SWC's share price on IPO day?"
- **Ask for sources:** "What are the key risks mentioned in the prospectus? Please cite the source."
- **Use clear language:** Write as if you're asking a friend

### ❌ DON'T:

- **Don't be too vague:** "Tell me about SWC" (too broad - what specifically?)
- **Don't use jargon you don't understand:** The AI will understand plain English!
- **Don't ask for predictions without context:** Instead of "Will the price go up?", ask "Based on historical trends, what factors have influenced SWC's share price?"

### Examples of Good Questions:

✅ "What is the current sats per share and how has it changed since IPO?"

✅ "Summarize Andrew Webley's view on Bitcoin treasury risks from his latest YouTube appearances."

✅ "What are the key risk factors mentioned in SWC's latest prospectus?"

✅ "How many Bitcoin purchases has SWC made since going public?"

✅ "What did the CEO tweet about on January 15, 2026?"

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "I can't find the download button on GitHub"

**Solution:**
- Make sure you're on: https://github.com/Jaakuice/SWC_Big_Brain_Ai
- The green "Code" button should be near the top right
- If you still can't find it, try a different web browser

### Problem: "The AI says it can't find the files"

**Solution:**
- Make sure you've opened the correct folder in your AI assistant
- In Cursor: Check that you see folders like "RNS", "Youtube", "Tweets" in the left sidebar

### Problem: "The AI gives me wrong information"

**Solution:**
- Ask the AI to cite its sources: "Can you show me which file you got that from?"

- Ask for examples: "Can you give me an example?"
- Break down your question: Instead of one big question, ask several smaller ones

### Problem: "The chat isn't working"

**Solution:**
- Make sure you're connected to the internet
- Try refreshing the page (if using a web-based tool)
