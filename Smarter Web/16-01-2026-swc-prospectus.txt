This document (Document) comprises a prospectus relating to The Smarter Web Company PLC (Company or
Smarter Web) prepared in accordance with the Prospectus Regulation Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority of the
United Kingdom (FCA) made under section 73A of FSMA. This Document has been approved by the FCA as competent
authority under the UK Prospectus Regulation. The FCA only approves this Document as meeting the standards of
completeness, comprehensibility and consistency imposed by the UK Prospectus Regulation. Such approval should
not be considered as an endorsement of the issuer that is, or the quality of the securities that are, the subject of this
Document. Investors should make their own assessment as to the suitability of investing in the securities. This Document
will be made available to the public in accordance with Rule 3.2 of the Prospectus Regulation Rules.
The ordinary shares (Ordinary Shares) are (as at the date of this Document) admitted to trading on the Access segment
of the Aquis Stock Exchange Growth Market. Application has been made to the FCA for all Ordinary Shares to be
admitted to the equity shares (commercial companies) category of the Ofﬁcial List and trading on the London Stock
Exchange’s Main Market (Admission). It is expected that Admission to listing on the Ofﬁcial List and trading on the
London Stock Exchange will become effective and that unconditional dealings in the Ordinary Shares will commence
at 8.00 a.m. on 3 February 2026. All dealings in the Ordinary Shares prior to the commencement of unconditional
dealings will be on a “when issued” basis and will be of no effect if Admission does not take place and will be at the sole
risk of the parties concerned. No application is currently intended to be made for the Ordinary Shares to be admitted
to listing or trading on any other exchange.
This Document is issued solely in connection with Admission. This Document does not constitute or form
part of an offer or invitation to sell or issue, or any solicitation of an offer to purchase or subscribe for, any
securities by any person. No offer of Ordinary Shares is being made in any jurisdiction.

Solely for the purposes of the product governance requirements of Chapter 3 of the FCA Handbook Product Intervention

elsewhere to the extent determined to be applicable, and disclaiming all and any liability, whether arising in tort, contract
or otherwise, which any “manufacturer” (for the purposes of the UK Product Governance Requirements) may otherwise
have with respect thereto, the Ordinary Shares have been subject to a product approval process, which has determined
that such Ordinary Shares are (i) compatible with an end target market of retail investors and investors who meet the
criteria of professional clients and eligible counterparties, each as deﬁned in Chapter 3 of the FCA Handbook Conduct
of Business Sourcebook and (ii) eligible for distribution through all permitted distribution channels (Target Market

all or part of their investment, (b) the Ordinary Shares offer no guaranteed income and no capital protection and (c) an
investment in the Ordinary Shares is compatible only with investors who do not need a guaranteed income or capital
protection, who (either alone or in conjunction with an appropriate ﬁnancial or other adviser) are capable of evaluating
the merits and risks of such an investment and who have sufﬁcient resources to be able to bear any losses that may
result therefrom. The Target Market Assessment is without prejudice to any contractual, legal or regulatory selling
restrictions in relation to Admission.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Target Market Assessment does not constitute (a) an assessment of suitability or
appropriateness for the purposes of Chapter 9A or 10A respectively of the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business
Sourcebook or (b) a recommendation to any investor or group of investors to invest in, or purchase, or take any other
action whatsoever with respect to the Ordinary Shares.

Principal activities
The Company is the holding company of Smarter Web Operations,which was established in 2009 as a UK-based web design
ﬁrm with a clear vision: to make professional website design accessible, affordable, and effective for small and medium-sized
businesses. From its inception, the company recognised that traditional web design agencies were often too expensive or overly
complex for smaller enterprises. By building an efﬁcient, technology-driven model focused on scalability and customer
satisfaction, The Smarter Web Company established itself as a trusted digital partner for over 250 clients.
Over the past decade Smarter Web Operations has reﬁned its systems, design process, and customer experience to deliver
what the Board believes are exceptional websites. Its approach blends automation with expert design oversight, enabling
bespoke, high-quality websites for small to medium-sized enterprises, start-ups, and independent professionals. By tailoring its
offerings to entrepreneurs and growing ﬁrms – from retail and hospitality to healthcare and technology – the Company has built
a loyal client base that values both quality and transparency.
Core services include readymade and bespoke websites, custom design and development, logo creation, copywriting, and
online marketing services such as search engine optimisation. Each site is delivered with a robust, user-friendly content
management system, empowering clients to manage their sites independently. The Company’s streamlined onboarding and
optional digital marketing services support clients to enhance their online presence and drive growth. Its vision is simple: to
provide smaller businesses with low-cost, high-quality web solutions that enables them to compete effectively online.
As it continues to expand, the Company remains committed to its founding principles of affordability, quality, and customer
empowerment. With a proven business model, a growing client base, and scalable digital infrastructure, Smarter Web Operations
is well-positioned to capture further market share in the SME web services sector. The Company’s proposed listing on the London
Stock Exchange marks the next stage in this growth journey, providing the capital and visibility to accelerate innovation and
strengthen its leadership in the affordable digital services space.
The Group continues to review, on an ongoing basis, strategic acquisition opportunities to bolster the growth of its business
and expand the service offering to its clients.

31 October 2024 by Adler Shine LLP, of Aston House, Cornwall Avenue, London N3 1LF. Auditors’ reports in respect of each
statutory accounts for the ﬁnancial years ended 31 October 2022, 31 October 2023 and 31 October 2024 have been made

made a loss in the current year as well as having a cash position of £77,224 and net liability position of £208,024 as at 31
October 2022. The company needs to raise funds in the near term for working capital purposes. As a result this casts a material
uncertainty as to the future performance of the company for the 12 months following the audit report signature date. The Chief
Executive’s Statement outlines the future plans of the company which contain a number of conditional events that are required
to occur in order for the company to resume proﬁtable trading and working capital coverage. Our opinion is not modiﬁed in
respect of this matter.”

its shares on the Aquis Exchange which itself was dependent on a separate transaction proceeding.
31 October 2023

statements, which indicates that the Group made a loss in the current year as well as having a cash position of £9,055 and net
liability position of £416,683 as at 31 October 2023. The company needs to raise funds in the near term for working capital
purposes. As a result this casts a material uncertainty as to the future performance of the company for the 12 months following
the audit report signature date. The Chief Executive’s Statement outlines the future plans of the company which contain a
number of conditional events that are required to occur in order for the company to resume proﬁtable trading and working
capital coverage. Our opinion is not modiﬁed in respect of this matter.”
The material uncertainty was due to the Company’s ability to raise additional funds being directly linked to it successfully listing
its shares on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) which itself was dependent on a separate transaction proceeding.

31 October 2024
“We draw attention to note 2 to the ﬁnancial statements, which indicates that the accounts have been prepared on the going
concern basis. The Group made a loss in the current year as well as having a cash position of £109,252 and net liabilities
position of £921,384 as at 31 October 2024. The company needs to raise funds in the near term for working capital purposes.
As a result, this casts a material uncertainty as to the future performance of the company for the 12 months following the audit
report signature date. The Chairman’s statement outlines the future plans of the Group which contain a number of conditional
events that are required to occur in order for the Group to resume proﬁtable trading and working capital coverage. Our opinion
is not modiﬁed in respect of this matter.”
The material uncertainty was due to the Company’s ability to raise additional funds being directly linked to it successfully listing
its shares on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) which itself was dependent on a separate transaction proceeding.

Since 31 July 2025, being the date to which the latest ﬁnancial information in respect of the Group was prepared, the Company
has acquired a further 614 Bitcoin bringing the total number of Bitcoin held in treasury to 2,664. However, Bitcoin has
experienced a decline in value since the reporting date of approximately 24 per cent. (to 9 January 2026) and is trading below
the Group’s average purchase price resulting in an unrealised loss of £40.3 million in relation to the Group’s Bitcoin holdings.

2.3

What are the key risks that are speciﬁc to the issuer?
The following is a summary of key risks that, alone or in combination with other events or circumstances, could have a material
adverse effect on the Group’s business, results of operations, ﬁnancial condition or prospects:
l

Competition – The Group may face signiﬁcant competition from larger competitors with access to greater resources who
may develop and deploy new technologies or features that could provide them with a competitive advantage and erode
the Group’s market share.

l

Key man risk – The success of the Group is highly dependent on the expertise of Andrew Webley and other senior
managers, and the loss of Andrew or any key personnel could harm the business or cause delay in the plans of the
Group.

l

Technology – There is a risk that signiﬁcant technical failure, software bugs or disruption in the Group’s content
management system could disrupt the Group’s business and materially and adversely affect the Group’s goodwill and
brand perception.

l

Stakeholder perception risk – The Group holds a signiﬁcant amount of Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Some potential partners
may view this unfavourably which may reduce the joint venture and merger opportunities that the Group is able to pursue.

l

Growth through acquisitions – The Group is seeking to grow its web design business through acquisitions of other
complementary and adjacent businesses. There is no guarantee that the Group will be able to identify such opportunities
and reach acceptable commercial terms with the vendors.

l

Volatility of Bitcoin – The Group’s policy of accepting Bitcoin for payment and its treasury management strategy exposes
the Group to risks associated with the ﬂuctuations in the price of Bitcoin. The value of the Group’s Bitcoin holdings may
increase or decrease substantially and unpredictably in the future. A material decline in the value of Bitcoin is likely to
adversely affect the Group’s ﬁnancial position and the market price of the Ordinary Shares.

l

Bitcoin is held by custodians – As the Group’s Bitcoin is held by third party custodians, in the event that one of these
custodians was to become insolvent there is a risk that some or all of Group’s Bitcoin held by that custodian could be
lost and/or become inaccessible for a period.

l

Regulation – Regulatory change could lead to the reclassiﬁcation of the Group as an alternative investment fund which
could adversely impact the Group and/or require it to become authorised by the FCA and/or change the Group’s strategy.

l

Accounting treatment of Bitcoin holdings – Not all accounting standards are aligned on how Bitcoin is to be treated.This
creates a risk of false comparisons being made between the Group and other issuers that have adopted different
accounting treatment for the Bitcoin they hold, which could lead to investors making incorrect comparisons with the
Group’s ﬁnancial performance, and may decrease demand for the Group’s shares.

l

Taxation treatment of Bitcoin – Tax laws applicable to Bitcoin are evolving.Various governments could introduce proposals
for tax legislation, or adopt tax law, which may have an adverse effect on the Group’s worldwide effective tax rate, or
have other negative tax consequences on the Group.

Key information on the securities

3.1

What are the main features of the securities?
Type, class and ISIN of the securities
When admitted to trading, the Ordinary Shares will be registered with ISIN GB00BPJHZ015. The Deferred Shares will not be
admitted to trading.
Currency, denomination, par value, number of securities issued and term of the securities
The Ordinary Shares are denominated in pounds sterling and, upon Admission, will have a par value of £0.001 each and an
indeﬁnite term. On Admission, the Company will have an issued ordinary share capital of £350,237.09, divided into 350,237,093
Ordinary Shares with a nominal value of £0.001 each, as well as 7,050,000 unlisted Deferred Shares of £0.049 each in the
capital of the Company.
Rights attaching to the securities
The Ordinary Shares rank and, upon Admission, will rank equally in all respects with each other and have the following rights
attaching to them:
l

on a show of hands at a general meeting, every member present in person has one vote and every proxy or representative
present who has been duly appointed by a member entitled to vote has one vote; and on a poll every member (whether
present in person or by proxy or representative) has one vote per Ordinary Shares;

l

the right to receive dividends on a pari passu basis; and

l

if the Company is wound up, the surplus assets remaining after payment of all creditors are to be divided amongst the
members in proportion to the capital which at the start of the winding-up is paid up on the Ordinary Shares held by them,
respectively.

The relative seniority of the Ordinary Shares in the Company’s capital structure in the event of insolvency
On winding up, the Company’s distributable assets will be shared among Shareholders in proportion to the to the nominal
amounts of capital paid up on their shares, subject to the terms of issue of or rights attached to any shares. The terms of issue
of the Deferred Shares set out that the holders of the Deferred Shares are only entitled to receive a return on capital once the
holders of Ordinary Shares have ﬁrst received a return on capital of £1,000,000 in respect of each ordinary share held.
Restrictions on free transferability of the securities
Upon Admission, the Ordinary Shares will be free from any restriction on transfer, subject to compliance with applicable securities
laws.

9

Capital allocation and dividend policy
The Directors’ current intention is to retain any earnings for use in the Company’s operations and the Directors do not anticipate
declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future. The Company will only pay dividends at such times (if any) and in such amounts
(if any) as the Board determines appropriate and to the extent that to do so is in accordance with all applicable laws.
3.2

Where will the securities be traded?
Application will be made to the FCA for the Ordinary Shares to be admitted to the equity shares (commercial companies) category
of the Ofﬁcial List, and to the London Stock Exchange for the Ordinary Shares to be admitted to trading on the Main Market for
listed securities of the London Stock Exchange. It is expected that Admission will take place and unconditional dealings in the
Ordinary Shares will commence on the London Stock Exchange at 8.00 a.m. on 3 February 2026. The Company’s Ordinary Shares
are already admitted to trading on the OTCQB Venture Market in the United States and are accessible to German investors through
an unsponsored depositary receipt listing on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.

3.3

What are the key risks that are speciﬁc to the securities?
l

Potential dilution from future ﬁnancings and warrant exercises – The Directors anticipate that the Company will continue
to raise funds through equity issuance to deliver its business strategy and there are signiﬁcant number of warrants in
issue that can be exercised signiﬁcantly below the market price (as at the date of this Document) and both of these
factors are likely to lead to dilution for Shareholders.

l

Risks related to the current authority to allot and disapplication of pre-emption rights – The Directors hold a large authority
to issue Ordinary Shares non-pre-emptively and have issued large numbers of Ordinary Shares non-pre-emptively since
the Company’s shares were admitted to the AQSE Growth Market. Therefore, there are likely to be further share issues
that dilute existing shareholders.

l

Legal remedies – Overseas shareholders may have limited ability to bring actions or enforce judgments against the Group
or its Directors.

l

Dividend payments on the Ordinary Shares are not guaranteed and the Group does not intend to pay dividends in the
foreseeable future – The Company has no intention of declaring a dividend and therefore Shareholders are unlikely to
receive a dividend from the Ordinary Shares for the foreseeable future.

10

Risk Factors
Any investment in the Ordinary Shares is subject to a number of risks. Prior to investing in Ordinary Shares,
prospective investors should carefully consider the risk factors associated with any investment in the Ordinary
Shares, the Group’s business and the industry in which it operates together with all other information
contained in this Document, including, in particular, the risk factors described below.
Prospective investors should note that the risks relating to the Group, its industry and the Ordinary Shares
summarised in “Summary” are the risks that the Directors believe to be the most relevant to an assessment
by a prospective investor of whether to consider an investment in the Ordinary Shares. However, as the
risks which the Group faces relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in
the future, prospective investors should consider not only the information on the key risks summarised in
“Summary” but also, among other things, the risks and uncertainties described below.
The risks and uncertainties described below are not an exhaustive list or explanation of all risks relating to
the Group and should be used as guidance only. Additional risks and uncertainties relating to the Group
that are not currently known to the Directors, or that the Directors currently deem immaterial, may individually
or cumulatively also have a material adverse impact on the Group’s business, results of operations, ﬁnancial
condition or prospects. In such case, the market price of Ordinary Shares could decline. You should carefully
consider the information in this Document in light of your personal circumstances.

RISKS RELATING TO THE GROUP’S BUSINESS
The Group operates in a highly competitive industry
The Group’s core operational business is web design and there are a number of larger and more established
competitors with access to substantial ﬁnancial resources, larger operational capabilities, and longer track
records in software development with whom the Group competes. These larger entities may develop and
deploy new technologies or features that could provide them with a competitive advantage. This exposes
the Group to intense competition, pricing pressure, and potential erosion of the Group’s market share. The
Group may need to invest signiﬁcant resources in developing and maintaining cutting-edge technologies,
such as data analytics capabilities, to remain competitive. Failure to keep up with technological
advancements or to differentiate itself in a saturated market could impact the Group’s trading volumes,
transaction fees, and overall revenues, potentially affecting its ﬁnancial performance and market position.
The Group is increasingly facing competition from ﬁrms using AI tools to develop products on behalf of
clients in a more cost efﬁcient manner. The Group does not yet have its own bespoke AI solution.
Competitors have the opportunity to forge strategic partnerships and alliances with key stakeholders in the
AI sector, including software developers, universities, and potential corporate clients which could lead to
enhanced competitive advantages over the Group. The Group may be at a disadvantage should it not form
such partnerships and does not currently have any strategic partnerships or alliances.
Key man risk
The success of the Group, common with other businesses of a similar size, will be highly dependent on the
expertise and experience of its Directors and senior management. The Company has a relatively small
management team and in particular Andrew Webley is crucial to the operation of the business. The loss of
any senior manager or other key employee could signiﬁcantly delay or prevent the achievement of the
Company’s strategic objectives. Andrew, the founder of Smarter Web Operations, has relationships with
the Group’s clients who are largely based around the UK, where Andrew is based and built the Company’s
digital platforms. Andrew has also been instrumental in building relationships with the Group’s other key
stakeholders. The loss of Andrew would mean that a replacement would need to build relationships with
clients and other stakeholders in order to maintain the client base, work efﬁciently with service providers
and maintain shareholder support for the board’s strategy. If a replacement failed to do this it could result in
decreased revenue and loss of conﬁdence in the management, both of which are likely to negatively affect
the share price.
The future success of the Group and the implementation of its strategy is dependent upon its ability to
identify, attract, motivate and retain senior management and other key staff with the requisite expertise and
experience to help build out the Group’s operational business. If the Group is unable to attract such talent
11

and retain the talent it has, the Group will be unable to grow its revenue which is likely to negatively affect
the share price in the long run.
Risks relating to the Group’s software platform
The Group’s business depends on the continuous and reliable operation of its proprietary content
management system (CMS), which has been developed in-house, as well as the availability of third-party
software tools. Any signiﬁcant technical failure, software bug, or disruption in the CMS could prevent the
Group from building new websites or maintaining existing ones. Similarly, defects or outages affecting
websites hosted on the Group’s platform could impair functionality or availability for customers. Such events
may lead to contractual breaches, customer dissatisfaction, and reputational damage, which could materially
and adversely affect the Group’s goodwill and brand perception, which in turn will affect revenue and may
negatively affect the share price.
Reputational and stakeholder perception risk
The Group holds a signiﬁcant amount of Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Some potential partners in the web
design sector may view this unfavourably which may reduce the joint venture and merger opportunities that
the Group is able to pursue. It also may hamper the Group’s ability to obtain debt ﬁnance to expand its web
design business or make acquisitions. If potential partners and/or ﬁnanciers were not willing to dealing with
the Group due to its Bitcoin exposure this may limit the Group’s ability to scale up its operating business
organically and inorganically. This in turn will limit the Group’s ability to generate revenue to help it meet its
running costs and negatively affect the Group’s proﬁt. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to qualify the
working capital statement at paragraph 18, Part 7 of this Document.
Risks related to growth through acquisitions
The Group is seeking to grow its web design business through acquisitions of other complementary and
adjacent businesses. However, this is dependent on its ability to identify sufﬁcient and suitable opportunities.
There is no guarantee that the Group will be able to identify such opportunities and reach acceptable
commercial terms with the vendors. Even if a suitable target is identiﬁed by the Group, the transaction may
not be completed in a timely manner, may not be cost-effective or may not proceed for a number of valid
reasons, including, inter alia, the Group is outbid by a competitor, terms cannot be agreed with the vendors
or due diligence reveals signiﬁcant issues with the target. Aborting a proposed acquisition or acquisitions
could mean that the Group is left with substantial unrecovered transaction costs, potentially including fees,
legal costs, accounting costs, due diligence or other expenses to allow it to pursue further opportunities.
This could result in a signiﬁcant decrease of the Group’s cash funds which may impact other operational
aspects of the Group’s business and may also lead to a decrease in the conﬁdence in the Board and a
decline in the price of the Ordinary Shares.
If the Group makes any acquisitions, it may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into the
existing business and may be unable to achieve expected operating margin improvements, synergies or
efﬁciencies and could also incur or assume signiﬁcant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities in
connection with the acquisitions. The Group’s reported operating results could be negatively affected by
acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortisation of expenses related to intangibles and charges for
impairment of long-term assets. The Group may be subject to litigation in connection with, or as a result of,
acquisitions, dispositions, licences or other alliances, including claims from terminated employees, customers
or third parties, and the Group may be liable for future or existing litigation and claims related to the acquired
business, disposition, licence or other alliance because either the Group is not indemniﬁed for such claims
or the scope or availability of indemniﬁcation is limited. These effects could cause the Group to incur
signiﬁcant expenses and could materially and adversely affect the Group’s business, results of operations
and ﬁnancial condition.
Integration of an acquired company may also disrupt ongoing operations and require management resources
that otherwise would be focused on developing and expanding the Group’s existing business.
The Group may be unable to raise additional capital needed to grow its business
The Group may need to raise additional capital following the end of the 12 months from the date of this
Document (Working Capital Period) to respond to competitive pressures and/or to remain attractive to
investors. In the future, the Group may not be able to obtain equity or debt ﬁnancing on favourable terms,
12

if at all, which could impair its growth and adversely affect its existing operations and cause the Group to
need to sell Bitcoin to fund trading operations. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to qualify the working
capital statement at paragraph 18, Part 7 of this Document.
If the Group raises additional equity ﬁnancing, existing Shareholders may experience signiﬁcant dilution, and
the share price of the Ordinary Shares could decline. If the Group incurs debt ﬁnancing, the holders of the
debt likely would have priority over Shareholders on order of payment preference. The Group may also be
required to accept terms as part of any equity or debt ﬁnancing that restrict its ability to incur additional
indebtedness or take other actions including terms that require the Group to maintain speciﬁc liquidity or
other ratios that could otherwise not be in the interest of investors. This paragraph is not intended to qualify
the working capital statement at paragraph 18, Part 7 of this Document.
If the Group or its third-party service providers experience a security breach or cyberattack, or
other similar circumstances occur, the Group may lose some or all of its Bitcoin and its ﬁnancial
condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected
The Group may be exposed to cybersecurity risks related to its business generally and the custody and
storage of Bitcoin in particular. Bitcoin and other Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies and the entities that
provide services to participants in the Bitcoin ecosystem have been, and may in the future be, subject to
security breaches, cyberattacks, or other malicious activities.
A successful security breach or cyberattack could result in:
(a)

partial or total loss of the Group’s Bitcoin holdings in a manner that may not be covered by insurance
or the liability provisions of the custody agreements with the custodians who hold the Bitcoin;

(b)

harm to the Group’s reputation and brand;

(c)

improper disclosure of data and violations of applicable data privacy and other laws; or

(d)

signiﬁcant regulatory scrutiny, investigations, ﬁnes, penalties, and other legal, regulatory, contractual
and ﬁnancial exposure.

Furthermore, any actual or perceived data security breach or cybersecurity attack directed at other
companies with digital assets or companies that operate digital asset networks, regardless of whether the
Group is directly impacted, could lead to a general loss of conﬁdence in the broader Bitcoin blockchain
ecosystem or in the use of the Bitcoin network to conduct ﬁnancial transactions, which could negatively
impact the Group’s ﬁnancial position.
In relation to the web design business, there are risks related to potential unauthorised access to client
websites, data breaches involving sensitive client information, and exploitation of vulnerabilities in web
applications or hosting environments. In 2020, Smarter Web Operations suffered a cyberattack where its
systems were breached. Smarter Web Operations believes the attackers were only able to access the
website code and do not believe it suffered any loss due to the attack. Smarter Web Operations corrected
the code, informed its clients, and logged the incident with the Information Commissioners Ofﬁce. A future
successful cyberattack could result in reputational damage, legal liability, ﬁnancial loss, and disruption of
services. If the Group were to suffer such an attack, then the Group’s ability to attract and retain clients is
likely to be negatively impacted which could in turn negatively impact the revenue of the Group.
There is a risk that the demand for web design services may decline including due to market
disruption from DIY website builders
The Group’s operational business involves the provision of professional web design, development, and digital
marketing services. While the Group has historically maintained a proﬁtable and scalable service model, the
market for web design services is subject to rapid technological change and evolving customer preferences.
In recent years, there has been signiﬁcant growth in the availability and adoption of do-it-yourself (“DIY”)
website building platforms such as Wix, Squarespace, and WordPress. These platforms offer low-cost,
user-friendly tools that enable individuals and small businesses to create and manage websites without the
need for professional design services. The increasing sophistication of these platforms—including AI-assisted
design features, integrated e-commerce capabilities, and search engine optimisation tools—has lowered
the barriers to entry for website creation and may reduce the demand for outsourced web design service.
13

If the trend towards DIY website creation continues or accelerates, particularly among the Group’s target
client segments, this could result in reduced demand for the Group’s services, increased pricing pressure,
and heightened competition. Additionally, the proliferation of template-based solutions may diminish the
perceived value of bespoke design services, potentially impacting the Group’s ability to attract and retain
clients.
The Group’s client contracts are not long term and so there is a risk that the Group’s revenue
will decrease in the future.
No web design or web hosting contracts entered into by the Group have a term of longer than 12 months
and there are no automatic renewal rights in such contracts. Under the Group’s client terms and conditions,
clients may terminate their agreements at any time and with one month’s notice to the Group. Therefore, a
large number of the Group’s clients could terminate their contracts with the Group. If this were to occur
then the Group’s revenue and proﬁt would be negatively impacted. However, there are practical difﬁculties
in moving a hosted website to a new supplier which in the past have meant the number of clients leaving
have been equal to or less than the number of new clients being found. Furthermore the Group’s revenue
is not concentrated in a small proportion of the Group’s client base and therefore the loss of a small number
of clients will not have a large impact on the Group’s business.

RISKS RELATING TO THE GROUP’S BITCOIN TREASURY ACTIVITIES
Risk relating to volatility of Bitcoin and the value of the Group’s holdings may decline
The Group’s policy of accepting Bitcoin for payment and its Bitcoin treasury strategy exposes the Group to
risks associated with the ﬂuctuations in the price of Bitcoin. The market price of Bitcoin has historically
exhibited signiﬁcant volatility and may continue to do so. For instance, in between 1 January 2024 and
1 January 2026 Bitcoin traded between US$38,522 and US$126,198.
The volatility of Bitcoin may be inﬂuenced by a wide range of factors outside of the Group’s control, including
regulatory developments, market sentiment, technological changes, the growth of other crypto-currency
and digital assets, macroeconomic trends, and speculative trading activity. As a result, the value of the
Group’s Bitcoin holdings may increase or decrease substantially and unpredictably in the future. As at the
date of this Document, the Group holds 2,664 Bitcoin with a total average purchase price: £82,858 per
Bitcoin (US$108,635 per Bitcoin). The Group aspires to grow its overall balance sheet, backed by a
substantial Bitcoin holding, to support its growth ambitions for its core business and capitalise on wider
growth opportunities that management believe exist in that market. A speciﬁc formal Bitcoin target does
not exist, rather an aspirational goal that over the next 10 years the Group will substantially grow its balance
sheet to give it a strong foundation for growth. If the number of Bitcoin held by the Group increases, the
Group’s absolute exposure to the Bitcoin price will increase.
Due to volatility and/or changes in the price of Bitcoin, the Group may not be able to realise its Bitcoin for
the same amount as it paid for it and/or the carrying value of the Group’s holding of Bitcoin may decrease.
A material decline in the value of Bitcoin is likely to adversely affect the Group’s ﬁnancial position, net asset
value, and its ability to meet strategic or operational obligations. This in turn is likely to negatively affect the
market price of the Ordinary Shares as the value of the Group’s gross assets will fall.
The Group’s Bitcoin holdings represent a material proportion of the Company’s market value. As the
Company aspires to continue to grow its overall Bitcoin holdings over time, in the event that the Group’s
core web design business does not grow at a corresponding rate, there is a risk that the market price of the
Ordinary Shares will be weighted even more towards the potentially volatile movements in the price of Bitcoin,
as opposed to the returns generated by the Group’s web design activities.
The Group’s Bitcoin is held by custodians. In the event that a custodian was to become insolvent
there is a risk that the Group’s custodian-held Bitcoin could be considered the property of the
custodian, hindering the Group’s access to its Bitcoin
The Group has established custody relationships for its Bitcoin with three third party institutional grade
custodians; namely Fidelity, Coinbase US (and related entities) and Kraken. The Group’s Bitcoin is held in
wallets maintained by these custodians. Access to these wallets is obtained through private keys which are
owned and held by the relevant custodian.

14

The Group has adopted this approach of using third party institutional grade custodians, rather than holding
Bitcoin directly, as the Directors believe institutional grade custodians provide greater security for the wallets
when compared with self-custody. This is because they believe it reduces the risk of unauthorised access
to the wallets. The Group seeks to address counterparty risk by diversifying its Bitcoin holdings across more
than one custodian, thereby reducing the potential impact of operational failures, insolvency, or other adverse
events affecting any single custodian.
There is a risk that one or more of the Group’s custodians used by the Group may become insolvent, which
may result in the creditors of the custodian obtaining access to Bitcoin held in the Group’s wallets.
Coinbase and Kraken are required under the Group’s custody agreements to hold the Group’s Bitcoin with
an entity within the United States, being (i) a New York Trust, in the case of Coinbase, and (ii) a Wyoming
entity, in the case of Kraken. The Group’s Bitcoin holdings with Coinbase are held by: Coinbase Inc., which
has a New York Department of Financial Services virtual currency licence (commonly known as a
“BitLicense”) and its subsidiary, Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC, which is a New York Statechartered limited purpose trust company. The Group’s Bitcoin holdings with Kraken are held by Kraken,
which holds a Special Purpose Depository Institution (SPDI) charter in Wyoming.
The Group’s custodian agreement with Coinbase includes an express opt-in to Article 8 of the New York
Uniform Commercial Code such that all digital assets held for the Group shall be treated as “ﬁnancial assets”
and the related account shall be deemed a “securities account” for purposes of Article 8. Under New York
law, digital assets held for the Group as ﬁnancial assets in a securities account are not part of custodian’s
bankruptcy estate, and the Company retains a statutory property interest that has priority over the claims
of the custodian’s general unsecured creditors. Furthermore, the custodian shall custody the Group’s digital
assets in segregated wallets and shall not co-mingle such assets with the custodian’s own assets.
In respect of Kraken, Wyoming Statute § 13-1-206 provides that digital assets held in custody for a customer
are not considered assets or liabilities of the custodian in any receivership, conservatorship, or federal
bankruptcy proceeding. Kraken further agrees in its agreement with the Company to comply with W.S.
§13-1-206 and to maintain the Company’s digital assets in accordance with that statute.
In respect of Fidelity, which is the Group’s UK custodian, the custodian is permitted to delegate services to
its afﬁliates, including Fidelity Digital Assets, National Association, a national bank subject to US Federal
banking regulation and oversight by the Ofﬁce of the Comptroller of the Currency, a US banking regulator.
The Group’s Bitcoin custodied with Fidelity is held in omnibus wallets alongside the digital assets of other
clients of the custodian (whereby client accounts are segregated at the books and records level and
managed through an omnibus account at the asset level). In the event of a shortfall, the Company’s recovery
rights will depend on applicable law in the jurisdiction where the assets are held, which may make it more
difﬁcult to determine in advance what rights the Group would have in respect of its Bitcoin.
However, bankruptcy law in the United States is not fully developed with respect to the holding of digital
assets in custodial accounts, and there is a risk that the Group’s Bitcoin will not receive the beneﬁts above
under applicable U.S. law in an insolvency situation.
As in the United States, bankruptcy law in the UK and Luxembourg is not fully developed with respect to
the holding of digital assets in custodial accounts, and there is a risk that the Group’s Bitcoin will not receive
the protection from creditors of the relevant custodian under applicable U.S. law in an insolvency situation.
This means there is a risk that the Group’s assets are held in a jurisdiction where the law does not clearly
distinguish the Group’s assets from those of other clients and creditors which could mean that the Group’s
custodian-held Bitcoin would be considered to be the property of the relevant custodian’s estate and the
Group would be treated as a general unsecured creditor of such custodian, thereby inhibiting the Group’s
ability to exercise ownership rights with respect to its own Bitcoin, or delaying or hindering access to its
Bitcoin holdings. This may result either in the loss of the value related to some or all of such Bitcoin, which
could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s ﬁnancial condition, or even on the Group’s ability to
recover its assets. The Group could also be unable to sell its Bitcoin which may cause liquidity issues, which
are likely to be damaging to the Group unless there are alternative forms of ﬁnance. The Group has sought
to mitigate this by using institutional-grade custodians who solvency is less likely to be an issue, and to
negotiate contractual provisions intended to secure treatment of the Group’s Bitcoin in a manner consistent
with more traditional ﬁnancial assets in the event of a custodian’s insolvency; however, such measures
cannot completely mitigate such risks, and there can be no guarantee that such custodians remain solvent
15

and for the reasons described above an insolvency of one of the Group’s custodians could lead to a loss of
Bitcoin of material value to the Group.
There is a risk that the Bitcoin Treasury Strategy is unsuccessful as it is a relatively unproven
strategy
The Group’s decision to adopt Bitcoin as a core treasury reserve asset reﬂects a strategic path that remains
largely untested across prolonged economic cycles and diverse market conditions. Unlike traditional reserve
assets, Bitcoin lacks a long-term track record within corporate treasury frameworks, and its behavior during
periods of macroeconomic stress – including prolonged deﬂationary environments – regulatory upheaval,
remains uncertain. While early adopters such as Strategy Inc (formerly MicroStrategy) have demonstrated
aggressive Bitcoin accumulation, the broader corporate ecosystem has yet to validate this approach at
scale. As a result, the Group may face unforeseen risks related to digital asset volatility, liquidity management,
and capital preservation, which could materially impact ﬁnancial performance and investor conﬁdence.
The unavailability of a broad pool of suitable custodians could mean the Group has no choice
but to enter into agreements with custodians on less favourable terms
The Group holds its Bitcoin with regulated custodians who have duties to safeguard the Group’s wallets by
securing the private keys to them. Private keys are conﬁdential, cryptographic credentials that permit a user
to access their digital wallet and control their Bitcoin holding. The Group’s existing custodial services
contracts do not restrict its ability to reallocate its Bitcoin holdings among custodians. In light of the signiﬁcant
amount of Bitcoin the Group expects to hold, the Group will continually seek to engage additional custodians
to achieve a greater degree of diversiﬁcation in the custody of the Group’s Bitcoin. If there is a decrease in
the availability of digital asset custodians that the Directors believe can safely custody its Bitcoin, for example,
due to regulatory developments or enforcement actions that cause custodians to discontinue or limit their
services, the terms on which the remaining custodians are willing to hold Bitcoin may become less favourable
to the Group due to the lack of competition, which may increase the Group’s costs. Reliance upon a small
pool of custodians could also increase the Group’s exposure to counterparty-speciﬁc risks, including
insolvency, operational failures, cybersecurity incidents, or other events that could lead to loss or
inaccessibility of the Group’s Bitcoin.
Risk associated with the concentration of a signiﬁcant portion of the Group’s assets in a single
asset
The Group anticipates that a signiﬁcant portion of its assets will be concentrated in its Bitcoin holdings at
any given moment in time especially as the Group is currently not planning to invest in other digital assets.
The concentration of assets in Bitcoin limits the Group’s ability to mitigate risk that could otherwise be
achieved by holding a more diversiﬁed portfolio of treasury assets and leaves the Group exposed to changes
in the price of Bitcoin. For instance in 2022, Bitcoin fell by approximately 67 per cent., from around
US$47,700 at the start of 2022 to a low of approximately US$15,760 in November 2022. This followed
Bitcoin reaching a high of US$69,000 in November 2021. This level was not reached again until March
2024, but even then it was not until later in 2024 that Bitcoin was consistently above that level. A more
recent example is that Bitcoin peaked in early October 2025 at over US$120,000 but as of 9 January 2026
it is trading just above US$90,000 and therefore in approximately three months Bitcoin has lost 25 per cent.
of its value. A signiﬁcant decline in the value of Bitcoin, whether similar to, or different from prior periods,
together with the Group’s exposure to Bitcoin’s volatility could therefore have a material adverse impact on
its ﬁnancial position, liquidity, and results of operations.
Liquidity and Market Access Risk
Bitcoin does not pay interest, dividends, or other returns, and Group can only generate cash from its Bitcoin
holdings if it sells its Bitcoin or implements strategies to create income streams or otherwise generate cash
by using its Bitcoin holdings. Bitcoin has no physical existence beyond the record of transactions on the
Bitcoin blockchain. The Bitcoin network operates on an open-source protocol. The Bitcoin network’s
functionality relies on external infrastructure including internet connectivity, mining operations, wallet software,
and exchange platforms. In the future, there may be periods of impaired market access, exchange outages
and/or market dislocation, which may impact the Group’s ability to access or transfer its Bitcoin holdings.
For instance in June 2022, Celsius Network LLC, a major crypto lending platform, paused all withdrawals,
swaps, and transfers between accounts for several weeks, citing “extreme market conditions” and later
ﬁled for bankruptcy. The Bitcoin network may also be vulnerable to network-level attacks, including potential
16

majority-mining attacks, or to future technological developments. Advances in digital computing, algebraic
geometry, and quantum computing could undercut the integrity of the Bitcoin blockchain and negatively
affect the price of Bitcoin. If this occurred, the value of the Group’s Bitcoin would decrease, resulting in
increased losses when the Group realises part of its Bitcoin holdings. Market stress, technical issues, or
cyber incidents could also reduce liquidity in the Bitcoin market, limiting the Group’s ability to convert Bitcoin
into ﬁat currency or rebalance its treasury when needed. Illiquidity due to technical issues may reduce the
popularity of Bitcoin and may result in further decreases to the value of the Group’s holdings of Bitcoin in
the future. Such liquidity issues may impact the Group’s ability to raise funds following the end of the Working
Capital Period and increase the likelihood that the Group would need to sell Bitcoin at reduced prices in
order to meet working capital requirements.
The Company has designated a portion of its Bitcoin holdings as a ring-fenced liquidity reserve intended to
be sold in circumstances where the Company’s current assets are insufﬁcient to meet any working capital
and short-term liquidity requirements. If the Company is required to realise part or all of this ring-fenced
Bitcoin reserve during or after the Working Capital Period, it may be forced to do so at a time when market
conditions are unfavourable. As a result, the Company may realise substantially less than the original
acquisition value of the Bitcoin, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s proﬁts.
Liquidity issues are likely to have a particularly negative impact on the Group if they occur at the time that
the Smarter Convert Notes are due for settlement. Although the amount of ﬁat currency the Group is required
to pay under these notes is closely tied to the value at the time of repayment of Bitcoin purchased using the
funds raised from the notes, if the Bitcoin market experiences liquidity issues at the time of repayment this
will limit the Group’s ability to sell the acquired Bitcoin to repay the relevant notes if the lender has asked for
repayment in ﬁat currency. In this instance, the Company would need to use its other cash resources to
repay the Smarter Convert Notes or reﬁnance the Smarter Convert Notes. If the Group were not able to do
this, the Company may be subject to enforcement proceedings which may lead to the winding up of the
Company unless the Company is able to repay the Smarter Convert Notes. The commencement of any
such action would be likely to lead to a signiﬁcant decrease in the value of the Ordinary Shares and ultimately
the delisting of the Ordinary Shares if the winding up proceeded. Nothing in this paragraph is an attempt to
qualify the working capital statement at paragraph 18, Part 7 of this Document.
Forks in the Bitcoin may affect demand for Bitcoin and therefore the price of Bitcoin
The Group holds a signiﬁcant amount of Bitcoin, which exposes it to risks associated with potential changes
to the Bitcoin protocol, commonly referred to as “forks”. A fork occurs when participants in the Bitcoin
network implement differing views of the protocol, resulting in changes that may cause the blockchain to
diverge. Forks are generally categorised as either soft forks or hard forks. Soft forks being backwardcompatible changes that tighten the rules of the protocol, which may lead to issues with validating
transactions through certain nodes; and hard forks being non-backward-compatible changes that result in
a permanent split in the Blockchain.
A hard fork may create a new cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin Cash in 2017), and holders of Bitcoin at the time
of the fork may receive an equivalent amount of the new asset depending on exchange and custodian
practices. There is a risk that a hard fork of Bitcoin may occur and it may cause: (i) signiﬁcant price
ﬂuctuations in Bitcoin due to uncertainty around adoption, utility, and long-term viability of the forked chain;
(ii) cryptocurrency exchanges to delay or refuse to support trading of forked assets, limiting the Group’s
ability to realise value of its Bitcoin; and (iii) vulnerabilities in the network, especially if the forked chain is not
widely adopted or lacks sufﬁcient mining support. There is a risk that any future forks may not be beneﬁcial
to the Group, including through limiting its ability to access, manage, or monetise its Bitcoin or any resulting
assets. Hard forks may also dilute the value of Bitcoin and/or undermine conﬁdence in Bitcoin, both of which
are likely to have a negative impact on the price of the Ordinary Shares.
Purchases and sales of Bitcoin are generally carried out in US Dollars and so the Group is
exposed to currency ﬂuctuations
Bitcoin is primarily quoted and traded in US Dollars and priced in US Dollars. If the Group were to sell any
of its Bitcoin holdings it would be likely to realise such holdings in US Dollars. The Group’s operating costs
are mainly in Sterling and the Group reports its ﬁnancial results in Sterling. Therefore, if Sterling strengthens
against the US Dollar, the value of the Group’s Bitcoin holdings and US Dollar holdings will decline in Sterling.
The Group does not currently seek to hedge this foreign currency risk. Therefore, the Group is exposed to
negative movements in the US Dollar which are likely to negatively impact the Group’s proﬁts.
17

Banks may not provide banking services, or may cut off banking services, to businesses that
provide Bitcoin related services or that accept Bitcoin as payment
The Directors believe that a number of companies that operate Bitcoin-related services have been unable
to ﬁnd banks that are willing to provide them with bank accounts and banking services. Similarly, the
Directors believe that a number of such companies have had their existing bank accounts closed by their
banks, sometimes at short notice. Banks may refuse to provide bank accounts and other banking services
to Bitcoin-related companies or companies that accept Bitcoin for a number of reasons, such as perceived
compliance risks or costs. There is a risk that the Group may be unable to access banking services due to
its holdings of Bitcoin and if this were to occur it is likely to damage the Group’s ability to operate its business
or force it to hold cash with lower rated counterparties. This in turn is likely to affect proﬁt by causing a
distraction for management and potentially increased banking related costs.
If a malicious actor or botnet obtains control of more than 50 per cent. of the Bitcoin network’s
processing power, such actor or botnet could manipulate the Bitcoin network
A malicious actor or botnet (a volunteer or hacked collection of computers controlled by networked software
coordinating the actions of the computers) that obtains a majority of the processing power on the Bitcoin
network could adversely affect the integrity of the Bitcoin Blockchain. If an individual mining pool, coordinated
botnet, or other actor were to obtain majority hash power, it could inﬂuence the conﬁrmation and ordering
of transactions, though it could not generate new Bitcoins or transactions using such control. The malicious
actor controlling a majority of the Bitcoin network’s processing power could attempt to execute a “doublespend” attack by generating an alternative transaction history in which previously spent Bitcoin is reassigned
to a different transaction. If the actor retained control of the majority hash power, and the Bitcoin network
did not coordinate to reject or override the attacker’s blocks, reversing the resulting blockchain reorganisation
could be impractical or infeasible, particularly with respect to recent blocks.
Although there are no conﬁrmed reports of successful malicious activity or control of the Bitcoin network
achieved through controlling over 50 per cent. of the processing power on the network, it is believed that
certain mining pools may have exceeded the 50 per cent. threshold. Because mining pools aggregate the
hash power of independent miners who may join or leave at any time, such concentration does not
necessarily indicate durable control, but it can create periods of heightened vulnerability in which a pool
operator could potentially inﬂuence block selection or transaction ordering. Therefore, the possible crossing
of the 50 per cent. threshold indicates a greater risk that a single mining pool could exert authority over the
validation of Bitcoin transactions. If Bitcoin mining were to become more concentrated among a small
number of mining pools or large operators, the likelihood of a single actor gaining signiﬁcant inﬂuence over
block validation could increase. Increased concentration of mining power could elevate the risk of transaction
censorship, blockchain reorganisations, or other consensus disruptions, any of which could adversely affect
the Group’s business, ﬁnancial condition, results of operations, or prospects.
Insolvency of a signiﬁcant player in the Bitcoin ecosystem may negatively affect Bitcoin
The broader digital assets industry is subject to counterparty risks and industry has seen a number of highproﬁle bankruptcies, closures, liquidations, regulatory enforcement actions and other events. Although these
bankruptcies, closures, liquidations and other events have not resulted in any loss or misappropriation of
Bitcoin held by the Group, nor have such events adversely impacted the Group’s access to its own Bitcoin,
they have, in the short-term, negatively impacted regulatory and general public perception and this has
impacted the adoption rate and use of Bitcoin generally. Additional bankruptcies, closures, liquidations,
regulatory enforcement actions or other events involving participants in the digital assets industry in the
future may further negatively impact the adoption rate, price, and use of Bitcoin.
The emergence or growth of other digital assets, including those with signiﬁcant private or public sector
backing, could have a negative impact on the price of Bitcoin and adversely affect the Group’s business
The health of the Group’s balance sheet is substantially dependent on the market price of Bitcoin. As at the
date of this Document, Bitcoin was the largest digital asset by market capitalisation and had the largest
user base. Despite this ﬁrst-to-market advantage, as at 21 December 2025, there were more than 28 million
alternative digital assets tracked by CoinMarketCap.com, and the total market capitalisation of digital assets
was approximately US$3.28 trillion (including the approximately US$1.85 trillion market capitalisation of
Bitcoin), as calculated using market prices and total available supply of each digital asset.

18

Many entities, including consortiums and ﬁnancial institutions are also researching and investing resources
into private or permissioned Blockchain platforms rather than open platforms like the Bitcoin network. At
the same time, central banks have introduced digital forms of legal tender (CBDCs). China’s CBDC project,
known as Digital Currency Electronic Payment, has reportedly been tested in a live pilot program conducted
in multiple cities in China. A recent study published by the Bank for International Settlements estimated that
at least 36 central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, have published retail or wholesale CBDC work
ranging from research to pilot projects. Whether or not they incorporate Blockchain or similar technology,
CBDCs, as legal tender in the issuing jurisdiction, could have an advantage in competing with, or replace,
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange or store of value.
The emergence or growth of alternative digital assets could have a negative impact on the demand for, and
price of, Bitcoin and thereby adversely affect the value of the Group’s Bitcoin holdings and an investment in
the Ordinary Shares.
Unauthorised access to the Group’s private keys required to access the Group’s digital assets
could cause signiﬁcant direct ﬁnancial loss, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm
Digital assets are generally controllable only by the possessor of cryptographic private keys or similar
credential-based mechanisms relating to the digital wallet in which the digital assets are held. Depending
on the custody model used, control may be implemented through a single private key, a multi-signature
arrangement, or distributed key-management technologies such as multi-party computation. Loss, theft,
corruption, or unauthorised disclosure of the relevant credentials can result in the permanent loss or
misappropriation of the associated digital assets.
The Group cannot provide assurance that any wallet or custody environment holding its digital assets, either
maintained directly by the Group or on its behalf by a third party custodian, will not be hacked or
compromised. Digital assets, related technologies, and digital asset service providers such as custodians
and trading platforms have been, and may in the future be, subject to security breaches, cyberattacks,
software vulnerabilities, insider misconduct, operational failures, or other malicious activities. As such, any
loss or compromise of the credentials used to control the Group’s digital assets could result in signiﬁcant
losses, hurt the Group’s brand and reputation, and potentially the value of any Bitcoin or other digital assets
the Group acquires or holds for its own account, and adversely impact its business. The Group’s private
keys are held, as at the date of this Document, by third party custodians that employ proprietary solutions
involving distributed or multi-party key-management procedures designed to ensure that no single individual
has unilateral access to the Group’s digital asset credentials. Notwithstanding these controls, there is a risk
that personnel within a custodian may collude to obtain unauthorised access to the Group’s private keys
and/or that external hackers may attempt to manipulate or exploit the custodians’ systems to authorise the
transfers of the Group’s assets to them.
The Group may be uninsured or inadequately insured in relation to the loss of Bitcoin by a
custodian
The Group holds a signiﬁcant portion of its assets in Bitcoin, which are custodied with third-party digital
asset custodians. While the custodians employ robust security protocols and the Group’s custodians have
either agreed to maintain insurance coverage in their contract or have stated that they hold insurance
intended to protect customer assets against certain risks, including cyber security incidents and theft.
However, such security protocols and insurance may not be sufﬁcient to make the Group whole in the event
of any loss, and certain insurance coverage is subject to limitations, exclusions, and conditions which could
affect the Group’s ability to recover losses in full.
In particular, there can be no assurance that the custodian’s insurance coverage would be sufﬁcient to cover
all losses suffered by the Group incurred in the event of a cyberattack, security breach, theft or other
operational failure. The Group is not proposing to obtain insurance in respect of losses caused by the
insolvency of a custodian. Furthermore, any insurance coverage held by the Group related to the loss of
Bitcoin held by custodian may be inadequate and/or not fully compensate the Group. As a result, any loss
of Bitcoin due to custodian failure, cyber incident, or insolvency could have a material adverse effect on the
Group’s ﬁnancial condition, results of operations, and prospects.

19

REGULATORY AND LEGAL RISKS
Risk that new laws are introduced that lead to the reclassiﬁcation of the Group as an alternative
investment fund and/or require FCA authorisation which could adversely impact the Group
The Group has sought legal and regulatory advice as to its status under English ﬁnancial regulation. As at
the date of this Document, the advice received is that the Bitcoin related activities of the Group should not
require the Group to need to be authorised by, regulated by or otherwise registered with the Financial
Conduct Authority in the UK. Equally, the Group should not be considered an “alternative investment fund”
for such regulatory purposes. However, there is no guarantee that the FCA will agree with such advice and
the regulation in the UK may change such that the Group is required to become authorised by the FCA
and/or change the Group’s strategy. If the Group was required to become FCA authorised there is no
guarantee that such authorisation could be obtained and it is likely that if the Group sought such
authorisation, this process would be likely to involve a signiﬁcant amount of expenditure which would
negatively impact the Group’s proﬁts and take up a signiﬁcant amount of management time which would
detract management from the management of the business which may result in the Group’s performance
declining.
Accounting treatment of Bitcoin holdings are not aligned
Not all accounting standards are aligned on how Bitcoin is to be treated. This creates a risk of false
comparisons being made between the Group and other issuers that have adopted different accounting
treatment for the Bitcoin they hold. In December 2023, the US Financial Accounting Standards Board that
sets the US GAAP standards issued a crypto-speciﬁc Accounting Standards Update (ASU), ASU 202308—Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350- 60): Accounting for and Disclosure
of Crypto Assets, which introduced fair value accounting for crypto assets. However, under IFRS, the
reporting standard the Group is using as at the date of this Document, Bitcoin holdings are generally classed
as Intangible Assets in accordance with IAS 38, as they are not being held for sale in the ordinary course of
business. Generally, under IAS 38 Intangible Assets are valued at cost less impairment rather than fair value.
Therefore, there is now a divergence between US GAAP and IFRS. The IASB which sets the IFRS standard
is currently undertaking a project to comprehensively review IAS 38 which may result in changes to IAS 38
that bring it closer to the US GAAP, but this is not expected to be concluded until after 2026.
The Group values its Bitcoin on the basis of the revaluation model which is an option under IFRS, which is
more similar to the measure used in US GAAP. Some other companies reporting under IFRS or other
accounting standards may adopt different approaches which may lead to investors making incorrect
comparisons with the Group’s ﬁnancial performance, which may decrease demand for the Company’s
shares. Also changes in the accounting treatment of Bitcoin holdings following the IAS 38 review may have
signiﬁcant impact on the Group’s balance sheet and proﬁt and loss especially if the Group is unable to adopt
the revaluation model.
The Company does not currently comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code in relation to
the number of independent non-executive directors on the Board, which may adversely affect
the effectiveness of the Board and investor conﬁdence
The UK Corporate Governance Code recommends, amongst other things, that at least half of the board of
a company (excluding the chair) should be comprised of independent non-executive directors. As at the
date of this Document, the Company does not meet this recommendation, as it has two independent nonexecutive director out of a total of ﬁve directors (excluding the chair).
As a result, the Board does not currently include a sufﬁcient number of independent non-executive directors
to satisfy the UK Corporate Governance Code’s recommendations. While the Company is committed to
maintaining appropriate standards of corporate governance and intends to take steps to appoint another
suitable independent non-executive director as soon as possible, there can be no assurance as to when
this will be achieved.
The absence of a sufﬁcient number of independent non-executive directors may limit the Board’s ability to
provide effective independent oversight of executive management, including in relation to strategy, risk
management and holding the performance of management to account.
In addition, non-compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code may adversely affect the perception
of the Company amongst institutional investors.
20

Risk of change in the taxation treatment of Bitcoin
Tax laws applicable to Bitcoin, particularly regarding capital gains, corporate tax treatment, and international
reporting requirements, are evolving. Various governments and intergovernmental organisations could
introduce proposals for tax legislation, or adopt tax law, which may have an adverse effect on the Group’s
worldwide effective tax rate, or increase its tax liability, introduce tax on the Group’s unrealised gains on its
Bitcoin holdings, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, or its deferred tax liabilities. The Group may
become subject to unexpected tax liabilities, reporting burdens, or retrospective policy changes, in the UK
or other jurisdictions where it operates or holds assets.
Changes in regulation in the United States may affect the Group’s US-based custodians
The Group currently uses four custodians, three of which are entities based in the United States. There is a
risk that regulation in the United States may change which may increase the operating costs of custodians
of Bitcoin in the United States and/or impose more onerous regulatory obligations on custodians of Bitcoin
in the United States. If this were to occur, then the Group’s costs of holding Bitcoin would be likely to increase
which would negatively affect the Group’s proﬁtability and/or reduce the number of potential custodians in
the United States which limits the Group’s ability to spread its counterparty risk in respect of its custodial
relationships and is likely to result in less competitive custody fees. This is likely to result in less proﬁt for the
Group.
The Group may become subject to new legal restrictions which adversely affect its business
In addition to existing laws and regulations, various governmental and regulatory bodies, including legislative
and executive bodies, in the United States and in other countries may adopt new laws and regulations, or
new interpretations of existing laws and regulations may be issued by such bodies or the judiciary, which
may adversely impact the development and use of digital assets and, in particular, Bitcoin. Many of the
existing legal and regulatory regimes were adopted when digital assets were not as widely held or accessible
as they are today. As a result, they often do not contemplate or address unique issues associated with
digital assets, are subject to signiﬁcant uncertainty, and vary widely across different jurisdictions. Therefore,
there is a greater risk that such legal and regulatory regimes will be updated so that they apply to digital
assets. These new laws, rules, and regulations may increase the regulatory burden on the Group or become
the subject of ongoing examinations, oversight, and reviews by US federal and state regulators and foreign
ﬁnancial service regulators, including the UK Financial Conduct Authority. These scenarios are likely to result
in the Group incurring addition costs which would decrease the Group’s proﬁt and possibly cause
reputational damage. This is likely to have negative impact on the Group’s share price.
The Group’s interpretation of laws or rules and regulations may differ from those enforcing the
rules
The relative novelty of treasury strategies which focus on digital assets and the signiﬁcant uncertainty
surrounding the regulation of digital assets may lead to relevant regulations being interpreted, and applied
in an inconsistent manner and some law may conﬂict with one another. In some scenarios this will require
the Group to exercise its judgment as to whether certain laws, rules, and regulations apply to it, and it is
possible that governmental bodies and regulators may disagree with the Group’s conclusions. Although the
Group intends to seek professional advice whenever it is unsure how to apply a particular provision to its
Bitcoin Treasury Policy, to the extent the Group has not complied with such laws, rules, and regulations, the
Group could be subject to signiﬁcant ﬁnes, limitations on the Group’s business, reputational harm, and other
regulatory consequences, as well as criminal penalties, each of which may be signiﬁcant and could adversely
affect the Group’s business, operating results and ﬁnancial condition.
The availability of exchange-traded products for Bitcoin may adversely affect the market price
of the Group’s listed securities
The global Bitcoin industry is currently characterised by developing regulatory oversight, with ﬁrms operating
in the sector currently subject to less regulation relative to comparable tradeable products in traditional
ﬁnancial markets. Most IOSCO members are in the process of developing and implementing further
regulation expected over the coming years. This is now changing in the UK.
With effect from 8 October 2025, the FCA will allow retail investors to buy Bitcoin exchange-traded notes.
The listing and trading of such products could result in a decline in the value of the Group’s shares relative
to the value of Bitcoin held by the Group.
21

The acquisition of Bitcoin may constitute a reverse takeover under the UK Listing Rules and
could require the Company to seek readmission and/or move to a different market otherwise the
listing of its shares could be cancelled by the FCA
Upon Admission, the Company is required to comply with the rules in respect of reverse takeovers in ULKR
7.5. These rules including certain announcement obligations such as an obligation to send a circular to
shareholders and a requirement for shareholder approval for a reverse takeover transaction. The meaning
of reverse takeover is set out in UKLR 7.1.4, being a transaction consisting of an acquisition of a business,
a company or assets, where any of the Percentage Ratios is 100 per cent. or more in under a Class Test to
the transaction, or where it in substance results in a fundamental change in the business or a change in
board or voting control of the Company. If the Company were to complete a reverse takeover, the FCA will
seek to cancel the listing of the Company’s Ordinary Shares, unless the FCA is satisﬁed that circumstances
exist such that cancellation is not required. Where cancelled, the Company must re-apply for the listing of
the Ordinary Shares.
After Admission, the Company will need to be conscious not to breach 100 per cent. of the Percentage
Ratios when applying the Class Tests if making an acquisition or a Bitcoin purchase. Acquisitions of a
particular type of asset, such as Bitcoin, are likely to be aggregated over a 12-month period for the purposes
of calculating the Percentage Ratios for the Class Tests. Therefore, there is a risk that if in a 12-month period
the Company made multiple purchases of Bitcoin, which when aggregated for the purposes of the Class
Tests meant the Percentage Ratio was 100 per cent. or more, the Company could be deemed to have
carried out a reverse takeover, causing the FCA to cancel the listing of the Company’s Ordinary Shares.
UKLR 7.1.5G includes details of the factors the FCA considers are indicators of a fundamental change,
which are (1) the extent to which the transaction will change the strategic direction or nature of the issuer’s
business; (2) whether its business will be part of a different industry sector following the completion of the
transaction; or (3) whether its business will deal with fundamentally different suppliers and end users. If the
Company were to move away from its treasury backed web design strategy, or is otherwise deemed to be
undertaking a fundamental change of business, this may constitute a reverse takeover and the Company
be forced to apply for readmission which would involve signiﬁcant additional cost and possibly mean that
shareholders lost liquidity in the interim as the Ordinary Shares may be suspended or delisted.
The Group will incur additional costs as a Main Market listed company and its management will
be required to devote substantial time to new compliance matters
As a newly listed public company on the Main Market, the Company will incur signiﬁcant legal, accounting
and other expenses, including those resulting from Main Market reporting obligations and compliance with
corporate governance-related rules, including the Admission requirements of the FCA and the London Stock
Exchange. There can be no assurance that in an environment where the Group is subject to greater scrutiny
and disclosure requirements, it will be able to manage its operations in the same manner as it has done
before Admission as a company listed on the AQSE Growth Market and before that as a private business.
In particular, the Company will be subject to increased regulatory obligations as a result of being listed on
the Main Market, and management, as well as other employees, will need to devote a substantial amount
of time to ensure that the Group’s business complies with all of these requirements. In addition, the reporting
requirements, rules and regulations will increase the Group’s legal and ﬁnancial compliance costs and make
some activities more time-consuming and costly, which may have a material adverse effect on the Group’s
business, ﬁnancial condition, results of operations or prospects.
Anti-money laundering risks
Although Bitcoin is generally accepted as a major institutional grade asset class today, there have been
recent instances where Bitcoin and other digital assets have been used to launder the proceeds of illegal
activities, fund criminal or terrorist activities, or circumvent sanctions regimes such as the conviction of
Zhimin Qian for storing fraud proceeds in Bitcoin, large seizures of Bitcoin related to romance scams in
October 2025 and the indictment of Iurii Gugnin in the United States who is alleged to have funnelled more
than US$500 million of overseas payments from Russian sources through US banks and cryptocurrency
exchanges. Therefore, there is a risk that Bitcoin purchased by the Group on an exchange could have been
acquired by the seller through criminal acts. There is also a risk that the Group’s Bitcoin assets may be comingled by custodians with Bitcoin acquired through proceeds of crime.

22

In relation to acquisitions of Bitcoin, the Group acquires Bitcoin on well-known exchanges where the Group
is satisﬁed with their anti-money laundering procedures. The exchanges currently used by the Group’s
entities are subject to US Federal and state anti-money laundering regulation functionally equivalent to, or
consistent with regulation imposed on US-based banks, exchanges, and other regulated ﬁnancial
institutions.
Kraken holds a Special Purpose Depository Institution (SPDI) charter in Wyoming, which is a state-level
banking licence designed for digital asset companies. Under this charter, Kraken operates a Customer
Identiﬁcation Program to obtain, verify, and record the identity of each person who opens an account. This
sits alongside its AML obligations (including US Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)) and OFAC sanctions compliance.
The Group also purchases Bitcoin through Coinbase US (which is registered in Delaware) as a Money
Services Business (MSB) with Financial Crimes Enforcement Network bureau of the US Department of the
Treasury and is licenced as a money transmitter in multiple US states. As an MSB, Coinbase US is required
to have a Customer Identiﬁcation Program (including beneﬁcial information), comply with Suspicious Activity
Reporting and carry out Suspicious Activity Reporting and Ofﬁce of Foreign Assets Control sanctions
screening. The Group also purchases Bitcoin through Fidelity Digital Assets National Association, which
operates as a national bank regulated by the Ofﬁce of the Comptroller of the Currency. As a national bank,
Fidelity Digital Assets Services LLC is subject to US anti-money laundering laws and implements a
comprehensive compliance framework, including a Customer Identiﬁcation Program to obtain and verify
client and beneﬁcial ownership information. The Directors believe that Fidelity Digital Assets National
Association also conducts ongoing transaction monitoring, Suspicious Activity Reporting and OFAC
sanctions screening in line with BSA requirements and applicable state regulations. These measures are
designed to mitigate AML risks associated with digital asset custody and trading. Therefore, the directors
believe that the AML procedures of these US entities is very similar to those that would be expected of
equivalent entities in England.
In relation to the co-mingling of the Company’s Bitcoin by its UK custodian, it holds the Company’s Bitcoin
in an omnibus co-mingled wallet alongside the assets of other clients either in its UK entity or the New York
limited purpose trust company referenced above or elsewhere. The Company’s UK counterpart is obliged
to comply with the UK Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the
Payer) Regulations 2017 (as amended) including the carrying of risk assessments and controls and customer
due diligence.
However, in November 2023, the US Securities and Exchange Commission made allegations against Kraken
and a related company that they co-mingled billions of dollars in customer and corporate funds. This action
was dismissed in 2025 by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, but without any assessment of
the merits of the claims alleged in the action. In 2025, the Irish Central Bank made allegations against
Coinbase Europe Limited for failing to adequately monitor transactions due to coding errors. It is therefore
noted that the Company’s custodians, including Kraken, Fidelity and/or Coinbase Lux, may have systems
that are not foolproof and/or may not properly implement their obligations and/or be subject to such
allegations. If this were to occur, it may cause the Group to unknowingly purchase assets which were
acquired by the seller through criminals or ﬁnd its wallets are co-mingled with other wallets that relate to
Bitcoin acquired through crime. However, a similar risk arises when dealing with other forms of asset with
most other ﬁnancial services counter parties.
In terms of the Group’s own process it has implemented and maintains policies and procedures designed
to vet any investor purchasing shares directly from the Company, which includes third party checks against
matters including sanctions laws and regulations. However, there is a risk that bad actors will ﬁnd a way to
circumvent the Group’s controls and if this were to occur, the Group may be subject to regulatory
proceedings which may lead to a suspension in the trading of the Ordinary Shares, ﬁnes for the Group and
potentially sanctions against its ofﬁcers. All of which are likely to have a negative impact on the performance
of the Group and therefore the price of Ordinary Shares.
The Group’s business may be damaged if it suffers a data breach
The Group collects, stores and processes client data. As such, the Group is subject to data protection laws
and regulations, including the UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018. Any failure to comply with
applicable data protection laws, whether due to human error, cyber-attack, system failure, or malicious
activity, could result in signiﬁcant regulatory penalties, reputational damage, and loss of client trust. If this
occurs, it may impact the willingness of current and potential clients to trust the Group with their sensitive
23

information, which would be likely to have a negative effect on the Group’s revenue and proﬁt. Any
unfavourable publicity surrounding any data breach and any resulting adverse effect on ﬁnancial performance
are likely to have a negative effect on the Group’s share price.
Risks relating to US shareholder litigation exposure
In addition to the Company seeking Admission of its Ordinary Shares to the Ofﬁcial List and trading on the
Main Market, the Company maintains a quotation for its Ordinary Shares on the OTCQB Venture Market in
the United States. As a result, the Company may at any time have a number of US based shareholders and
therefore may be subject to litigation in the United States, including securities class actions and shareholder
derivative lawsuits.
US securities class actions, particularly those initiated by retail investors, have become increasingly common
against non-US issuers in recent years, including those quoted on the OTCQB Venture Market. In 2024
alone, 36 securities class action lawsuits were ﬁled against non-US issuers, with seven involving companies
headquartered in the United Kingdom. Plaintiffs in these actions frequently allege violations of US securities
laws in connection with declines in share price, public disclosures, or corporate governance matters.
Although the Company does not have a listing on a US national securities exchange and is not subject to
the periodic reporting requirements of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, its OTCQB Venture Market
quotation and US shareholder base may expose it to similar litigation risks. US securities litigation can be
costly, time-consuming, and may result in signiﬁcant ﬁnancial liabilities or reputational harm, regardless of
the outcome. Furthermore, the Company and its directors may not beneﬁt from the same legal protections
in US courts as they would under English law. Any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on
the Group’s business, ﬁnancial condition, results of operations, and prospects.

RISKS RELATING TO THE ORDINARY SHARES
The Ordinary Shares will be subject to market price volatility and the market price of the Ordinary
Shares may decline in response to developments that are unrelated to the Group’s operating
performance
The Ordinary Shares in the Company will be subject to market price volatility and the market price of the
Ordinary Shares may decline in response to developments that are unrelated to the Group’s operating
performance. The market price of the Ordinary Shares may be volatile and subject to wide ﬂuctuations as
a result of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, those referred to in this Risk Factors section, as
well as period-to-period variations in operating results or changes in revenue or proﬁt estimates by the
Group, industry participants or ﬁnancial analysts. The market price of the Ordinary Shares could also be
affected by developments unrelated to the Group’s operating performance, such as the operating and share
price performance of other companies that investors may consider comparable to the Group, speculation
about the Group in the press or the investment community, strategic actions by competitors, including
acquisitions or restructurings, changes in market conditions and regulatory changes in any number of
countries, whether or not the Group derives signiﬁcant revenue therefrom. Investors may not be able to sell
their Ordinary Shares at or above the price they bought them for.
Potential dilution from future ﬁnancings and warrant exercises
The Group anticipates that it will continue to periodically raise funds to support the growth of its business
whether that be to help fund organic growth, for acquisitions or to build the Group’s treasury. The issuance
of additional securities and the exercise of Warrants, share options and other convertible securities may not
be on a pre-emptive basis. Where funds are raised non-pre-emptively it will result in dilution of the equity
interests of any persons who are holders of Ordinary Shares prior to that raise.
The Company currently has 105,746,975 warrants in issue. Of these, 96,066,335 warrants grant the holders
the right to subscribe for Ordinary Shares at a price of 2.5 pence per warrant share, exercisable between
24 April 2026 and 24 April 2028. In the event that the Company’s share price is greater than 2.5 pence
between this period, it is likely that these warrants will be exercised in full which will result in the dilution of
the equity interests of any persons who are holders of Ordinary Shares at that time. In addition, 9,680,640
warrants are exercisable at a price of £1.50 per warrant share from 9 October 2025 to 9 October 2028. In
the event that the Company’s share price is greater than the exercise price for the warrants during the

24

exercise periods, it is likely that these warrants will be exercised in full, subject to the terms of the relevant
warrant instrument.
The Company has also issued £15,803,732.67 of convertible loan notes under the “Smarter Convert”
convertible loan note instrument, which may convert into up to 7,718,551 Ordinary Shares. These notes
are convertible at a price of £2.0475 per share at any time prior to maturity on 5 August 2026.
Exercise of these warrants and convertible securities will result in the dilution of the equity interests of any
Shareholders at that time. If all warrants and convertible instruments currently in issue were exercised or
converted in full (at the lowest possible exercise or conversion price), then this would result in the issuance
of up to 113,465,526 new Ordinary Shares, and a corresponding dilution of approximately 24 per cent.
(calculated against the Existing Share Capital) of the existing Shareholders.
Authority to allot and disapplication of pre-emption rights
The Company has issued 210,385,736 new Ordinary Shares non-pre-emptively since the Initial IPO. On
20 March 2025, the shareholders approved a disapplication of pre-emption rights in respect of
2,000,000,000 Ordinary Shares at the current nominal value. Currently, 1,649,762,907 Ordinary Shares
remain within the headroom to be issued on a non-pre-emptive basis for cash before the Company’s annual
general meeting in 2026 and may in certain circumstances issue shares in exchange for shares in a target
company without carrying out a valuation or making a pre-emptive offer. The Company is likely to seek to
raise further capital to develop its business and acquire Bitcoin to do this. Therefore, there are likely to be
further share issues after Admission that dilute existing shareholders, which existing shareholders are unable
to participate in and in this scenario those existing shareholders that do not participate will have their
shareholding diluted.
Legal remedies
The laws of the country to which a holder of Ordinary Shares is subject, as well as the laws to which the
Group is subject, can affect whether an investor has, and where an investor can pursue, legal remedies
against the Group or any other person or entity involved in a transaction. The Company is a public limited
company incorporated in England and Wales. The rights of holders of the Ordinary Shares are governed by
the laws of England and Wales and by the Articles. These rights differ from the rights of shareholders in
some non-UK companies. Investors should be mindful of this when either buying or selling securities,
especially those located outside of the United Kingdom. In these situations, investors may not have the
ability to seek certain legal remedies in the courts of their home country as private plaintiffs. Moreover, even
if investors sue successfully in such other courts, they may not be able to collect on a judgment against the
Group, or another entity or person, not subject to the laws, or not having a presence, in that plaintiff’s home
country. Investors may have to rely on legal remedies that are available in England and Wales, if any.
Dividend payments on the Ordinary Shares are not guaranteed and the Group does not intend
to pay dividends in the foreseeable future
Although the Board is not planning to pay dividends on the Ordinary Shares, it may pay dividends in the
future at such times (if any) and in such amounts (if any) as the Board determines appropriate and in
accordance with applicable law. Payments of such dividends will be dependent on performance of the
Group’s business. Under the Companies Act, a company can only pay cash dividends to the extent that it
has distributable reserves and cash available for this purpose. As a holding company, the Group’s ability to
pay dividends in the future will be affected by a number of factors, including having sufﬁcient distributable
reserves and its ability to receive sufﬁcient dividends from subsidiaries. The ability of companies within the
Group to pay dividends and the Group’s ability to receive distributions from its investments in other entities
are subject to restrictions, including, but not limited to, the existence of sufﬁcient distributable reserves and
cash. The Group can therefore give no assurance that it will ever be able to pay dividends going forward.
The Group does not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.

analyses and estimates, requiring the Group to rely on internally developed estimates. The Group does not
intend, and does not assume any obligation, to update industry or market data set forth in this Document.

identiﬁed.

7. No incorporation of website information
The contents of the Group’s websites, any website mentioned in this Document or any website, directly or

10. Forward-looking statements
This Document includes forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve known and
unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Group’s control and all of which are based
on the Directors’ current beliefs and expectations about future events. Forward-looking statements are
sometimes identiﬁed by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “believe”, “expects”, “targets”,
“may”, “will”, “could”, “should”, “shall”, “risk”, “intends”, “estimates”, “aims”, “plans”, “predicts”, “continues”,
“assumes”, “positioned” or “anticipates” or the negative thereof, other variations thereon or
27

comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts.
They appear in a number of places throughout this Document and include statements regarding the
intentions, beliefs or current expectations of the Directors or the Group concerning, among other things,
the results of operations, ﬁnancial condition, prospects, growth, strategies and policies of the Group and
the industry in which it operates. In particular, the statements under the section of this Document headed
“Risk Factors” and in Part 3 of this Document regarding the Group’s strategy, targets and expectations in
respect of the Group’s expected revenue, revenue mix, proﬁt, efﬁciencies and leverage afforded by greater
implementation of managed services, growth, accounting tax rates, capital expenditure, realisation rates,
and in the event of Admission, upon the operating results of the Group as well as other expressions of
Smarter Web’s targets and expectations and other future events or prospects are forward-looking
statements.
These forward-looking statements and other statements contained in this Document regarding matters that
are not historical facts, involve predictions. No assurance can be given that such future results will be
achieved; actual events or results may differ materially as a result of risks and uncertainties facing the Group.
Such risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to vary materially from the future results indicated,
expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements contained in this Document speak only as at the date of this Document. The
Group, the Directors and the Group’s advisers expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update
these forward-looking statements contained in this Document to reﬂect any change in their expectations or
any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which such statements are based unless required to
do so by applicable law, the Prospectus Regulation Rules, the UK Listing Rules, the Disclosure Guidance
and Transparency Rules or the UK Market Abuse Regulation.
The statements above related to forward-looking statements should not be construed as a qualiﬁcation of
the working capital statement contained in paragraph 18, Part 8 of this Document.

11. Enforceability of civil liabilities
The Company is organised as a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales.
Other than Tyler Evans, none of the Directors are citizens or residents of the United States. As a result, it
may not be possible for US investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Group
or the Directors located outside the United States or to enforce in the US courts or outside the United States
judgments obtained against them in US courts or in courts outside the United States, including judgments
predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the US federal securities laws or the securities laws of any
state or territory within the United States. There is doubt as to the enforceability in England and Wales,
whether by original actions or by seeking to enforce judgments of US courts, of claims based on the federal
securities laws of the United States. In addition, punitive damages in actions brought in the United States
or elsewhere may be unenforceable in England and Wales.

12. Available information
For so long as any of the Group’s securities are “restricted securities” within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3)
under the US Securities Act, the Group will, during any period in which it is not subject to Section 13 or
15(d) under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (US Exchange Act), nor exempt from
reporting under the US Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) thereunder, make available to any holder
or beneﬁcial owner of such restricted securities, or to any prospective purchaser of such restricted securities
designated by such holder or beneﬁcial owner, upon request the information required to be delivered
pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the US Securities Act.

Part 1
Information on the Company and Smarter Web Operations
The following should be read in conjunction with the other information regarding the Group in this Document,
including the section headed “Risk Factors”, and the Company’s consolidated Historical Financial Information
and the related notes included in Part 4 of this Document. Unless otherwise stated, the ﬁnancial information
relating to the Group set out in this Part 1 of this Document has been extracted without material adjustment
from the Historical Financial Information in Part 4 of this Document.
This Document includes forward-looking statements that reﬂect the current view of the Directors and involve
risks and uncertainties. The actual results of the Group could differ materially from those contained in any
forward-looking statements as a result of factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Document.

1. INTRODUCTION
The Company is the holding company of Smarter Web Operations, which was established in 2009 as a
UK-based web design agency, specialising in creating bespoke, mobile-friendly websites. Smarter Web
Operations currently offers a range of online marketing strategies to help businesses of all sizes enhance
their online presence including various web design packages, logo design, SEO, animation, and custom
development. Smarter Web Operations has traded proﬁtably since inception.
The Group was formed following the acquisition by the Company of the entire issued capital of Smarter
Web Operations on 25 April 2025 for a mix of cash, Ordinary Shares and Warrants. This acquisition occurred
simultaneously with the Company’s shares being admitted to trading on the AQSE Growth Market,
whereupon the Company changed its name to The Smarter Web Company PLC.
Shortly after admission of the Company’s Ordinary Shares to trading on the AQSE Growth Market, the
Company announced its 10-year plan setting out its growth strategy and the adoption of a digital assets
treasury policy.
Smarter Web Operations was founded by Andrew Webley, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer of the Company, to
address the demand for accessible, affordable and professional website design from small and mediumsized businesses. By building an efﬁcient, technology-driven model focused on scalability and customer
satisfaction, Smarter Web Operations has established itself as a trusted service provider for over 250 clients.
Smarter Web Operations’ approach combines automation and expert website design, with additional
complimentary digital services aimed at supporting the critical online marketing efforts of its clients. Over
the past decade, Smarter Web Operations has reﬁned its systems, design process, and customer
experience to deliver what the Board believes are exceptional websites.
Smarter Web Operations primarily serves small to medium-sized enterprises, start-ups, and independent
professionals across a wide range of industries, with many of its clients being owner-managed businesses
seeking a strong online presence without the overheads associated with large agency fees. By tailoring its
offerings to the needs of entrepreneurs and growing ﬁrms, Smarter Web Operations has built a diverse and
loyal customer base.
In 2022, Smarter Web Operations began accepting payment for its services in Bitcoin based predominantly
on Andrew Webley’s belief that Bitcoin would form a signiﬁcant component of the future of digital services
and transactional technology. Accordingly, and as a logical extension of this viewpoint, the Company also
established a digital assets treasury policy which has been reﬁned to the Company’s current Bitcoin Treasury
Policy. In line with its Bitcoin Treasury Policy, the Company holds the majority of its treasury assets in the
form of Bitcoin, based on the Board‘s belief that Bitcoin’s properties make it a uniquely attractive asset for
storing value in a manner that protects against inﬂation and beneﬁts from the growing adoption and value
of Bitcoin as both a median of exchange and an asset.
Since admission of its Ordinary Shares to trading on the AQSE Growth Market, the Company has completed
a number of further fundraises, predominantly through the issue of shares for cash and has applied the
majority of funds raised to acquiring Bitcoin in accordance with its Bitcoin Treasury Policy. As at the date of
this Document, the Company holds 2,664 Bitcoin with an average purchase price of £82,858. The Company
32

has also reviewed, and continues to review on an ongoing basis, strategic corporate acquisition opportunities
to facilitate the inorganic growth of its operating business and other opportunities to diversify its businesses.
The Board believes that the Company’s proposed listing on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange
marks the next stage in the Company’s growth, increasing its proﬁle and widening its investor base to
support its delivery of the 10 year strategy.

2. BACKGROUND AND HISTORY OF THE COMPANY
On 1 March 1982, the Company was listed on the Main Market operating as a buttons business.
On 3 December 2014, the buttons business was sold and the Company moved from the Main Market to
AIM and the Company became an investing company under the AIM Rules for Companies.
On 4 December 2015, the Company had neither undertaken a reverse takeover nor was it considered to
have implemented its investing policy and in accordance with Rule 15 of the AIM Rules for Companies. Its
shares were suspended on 4 December 2015 and the admission of its shares on AIM were consequently
cancelled on 6 June 2016.
Between 2019 and 2024, the Company’s focus was seeking an acquisition target within the natural
resources sector. The Company reviewed a number of different minerals projects within the natural resources
sector revised investment strategy and had identiﬁed an acquisition opportunity related to an asset owned
by Power Metal Resources, however, the transaction ultimately did not complete.
Subsequently, the Directors agreed on a new direction for the Company, looking at the web design, web
development and online marketing verticals and the prospective acquisition of Smarter Web Operations,
which was then known as The Smarter Web Company Limited.
On 25 April 2025, (i) the Company acquired the entire issued share capital of Smarter Web Operations; (ii)
the Company’s shares were admitted to trading on the AQSEGrowth Market as an operating company; and
(iii) the Company changed its name from Uranium Energy Exploration Plc to The Smarter Web
Company PLC.

3. CORPORATE STRUCTURE
The Group comprises three companies as set out below:
(a)

the Company was incorporated in England on 1 March 1907;

(b)

Smarter Web Operations was incorporated in England and Wales on 30 December 2009 with company
number 07113945; and

(c)

SWC Holdings Malta Limited was incorporated in Malta on 20 October 2025 with company number
C 113537.

Smarter Web is the sole shareholder of both Smarter Web Operations and SWC Holdings Malta Limited
and holds 100 per cent. of the voting rights over each such subsidiary.

4. BUSINESS STRATEGY
Smarter Web Operations’ mission is to provide smaller businesses with a low-cost, high-quality web solution
that empowers them to compete effectively online. The Directors also believe that Bitcoin will form a
signiﬁcant part of the future of commerce, and accordingly the Group aims to operate as a forward-looking
business with respect to both accepting Bitcoin payments from customers and building its balance sheet
by storing a signiﬁcant proportion of its corporate treasury in the form of Bitcoin.
Management believes that every business, regardless of size or budget, deserves a modern, well-designed
website and the tools to manage their online presence with conﬁdence. By combining professional design,
advanced technology, and transparent pricing, Smarter Web Operations aims to deliver exceptional value
that directly supports its clients’ growth and success. Since 2009, Smarter Web Operations has offered
solutions to businesses looking to improve their online presence. These solutions include:
33

l

readymade web design;

l

bespoke web design;

l

custom web development solutions;

l

website hosting;

l

logo design;

l

copywriting and other content initiatives; and

l

online marketing services, including SEO.

The Group’s “10 Year Plan” announced on 28 April 2025, comprises of the following three tenets:
Organic Growth
Smarter Web Operations has over 250 active client websites and has operated proﬁtably since inception
over 15 years ago. The Group aims to increase the number of clients Smarter Web Operations serves and
increase cross selling of its services to its client base. The Board believe that organic growth will be achieved
through increased investment in the business, growing its client base and increasing cross sell opportunities,
leveraging the enhanced proﬁle the Group has gained through its AQSE Growth Market listing which is
expected to be further strengthened by its proposed Main Market listing.
Acquisition Opportunities
In addition to organic growth, the Group aims to pursue growth by acquisition. Potential acquisition targets
will be considered for strategic ﬁt and benchmarked against internal parameters set by the Board. The
Group is targeting businesses that will generate sufﬁcient operating cash ﬂows to repay the acquisition cost
within 3 to 4 years whilst being additive to the Group’s core business expanding its service offering and
delivering synergies to increase operational leverage. The Group may also look to acquire businesses that
diversify its operations and further vertically integrate its operating structure. The Group believes it will be
able to leverage the strength of its balance sheet, bolstered by its Bitcoin treasury holdings, to fund
acquisitions. The Group expects that in the majority of cases it will continue to operate acquired businesses
under their pre-acquisition brand whilst integrating operations to achieve cost efﬁciencies and greater
economies of scale. The Group may use a mixture of Ordinary Shares and cash to ﬁnance acquisitions. The
Group is actively pursuing potential acquisition opportunities, led by Mario Visconti as Head of Projects,
working with external advisers to seek to accelerate and support this process.
Bitcoin Treasury Policy
The Directors believe that Bitcoin provides a uniquely attractive means to preserve value over time and
serves as a hedge against inﬂation of ﬁat currencies. The Directors also believe that the Bitcoin Treasury
Policy enhances the Group’s ability to attract investment and grow both its operating business and Bitcoin
treasury holdings. The Board believes this has been demonstrated by signiﬁcant recent new equity
investment into the Company since the admission of its Ordinary Shares to the AQSE Growth Market. It is
expected that, where new equity funding is available on terms which the Board believes are compelling and
in the interests of all shareholders, the Company will continue to seek to raise further capital to bolster its
balance sheet to support the future operational development of the Company and on the basis that its liquid
assets surplus to working capital requirements can be held within its treasury to preserve its value and that
this strategy will be accretive to the value of the Company’s Ordinary Shares over time.
The key objectives and parameters of the policy include:
l

preserving treasury value through strategic investment in Bitcoin;

l

use of approved creditworthy counterparties to custody this Bitcoin in a fashion suitable for an
institutional holder of Bitcoin;

l

the maintenance by the Group of sufﬁcient operational liquidity (minimum 12 months of operations);
and

l

use of capital market tools to grow the Bitcoin held in treasury for the future beneﬁt of the Group.

Further details on the Group’s Bitcoin Treasury Policy are set out in paragraph 8 of this Part 1 below, and it
is noted that the Company will not seek to generate returns through the active or speculative trading of
34

Bitcoin; once acquired, any Bitcoin will remain held within its treasury and only sold to the extent treasury
funds are required for its operating business strategy, major transactions or in the event that rebalancing is
required to adhere to the parameters of its Bitcoin Treasury Policy.
5. PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
The Group’s primary service is the creation of websites on a proprietary content management system (CMS),
developed by the founder, which the Group believes provides a strong service offering for lightweight
websites for small and medium-size enterprises.
Smarter Web Operations’ approach combines technology with expert design oversight to provide bespoke,
high-quality websites and associated complementary services such as SEO aimed at optimising the efﬁcacy
of its clients’ online presence.
Smarter Web Operations‘ product suite is built on top of its proprietary CMS and consists of several types
of offerings: website design, website hosting and ancillary website services. The CMS forms the core of the
Group’s technology infrastructure and enables the efﬁcient creation, management and updating of website
content by users without the need for specialist coding skills. This system facilitates scalability, consistency
and cost efﬁciency in the delivery of the Group’s services across a large client base. Smarter Web Operations
website design offerings consist of ‘ready-made’ websites and bespoke web design with varying levels of
customisation.
Smarter Web Operations’ core service offering includes:
l

readymade web design;

l

bespoke web design;

l

custom web development solutions;

l

logo design;

l

copywriting and other content initiatives; and

l

online marketing services, including SEO.

Each website aims to deliver a robust, user-friendly content management system that allows clients to
update and manage their sites independently. In addition to website creation, Smarter Web Operations then
provides optional digital marketing services, enabling clients to enhance their online visibility and drive
business growth.
Once a client website is completed, the client pays an annual recurring hosting charge for the duration of
their time as a website client. In addition to the core product offering, Smarter Web Operations also provides
ancillary website services including ongoing website support, logo design, copywriting, SEO and other
custom web development solutions.
The charging model for Smarter Web Operations is broken down into four main components: an initial web
design fee, an annual recurring hosting charge, optional monthly marketing charges for ancillary services
and ongoing support charges. Recurring revenue typically accounts for approximately 30 per cent. of
revenue. As a result of these highly scalable product offerings, Smarter Web Operations was able to achieve
gross margins of over 90 per cent. in the web design business during ﬁscal year 2024 and believes there is
signiﬁcant scope to grow these high-margin revenues. The highest margins over the lifespan of a design
(usually around six years) are generated from readymade websites, which are less time intensive to produce.
The highly bespoke websites are three times less proﬁtable than the readymade websites despite the upfront
charges being signiﬁcantly more. This is because they take up more development time and there is a lower
recovery on each hour worked.

6. MARKET OPPORTUNITY
According to Mordor Intelligence, the global Web Development Services market is valued at US$80.6 billion
in 2025 and is projected to reach US$125.4 billion by 2030, representing a CAGR of 9.3 per cent. driven
by a number of key trends. Key trends underpinning the growth include: artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), machine
learning (ML) and the expansion of ‘Low-Code’ and ‘No-Code’ platforms. The increasing availability of AI
tools and growth in the application of ML has led to increased adoption of AI and ML by the general public
35

over recent years. The adoption of AI in the software development space has enhanced operational efﬁciency
and client experiences, providing greater opportunities for software development businesses to scale. In
tandem with this, the expansion of low-code and no-code capabilities has signiﬁcantly increased the ability
to create custom platforms at a faster rate, allowing businesses to expand their client base and offering.
The Directors believe that having an online presence has evolved from being a supplementary business
consideration to a core part of any businesses ability to succeed that the demand for full-service web design
agencies that offer holistic web site and digital marketing solutions at a competitive price continues to rise
as businesses as seek cohesive, multi-channel strategies.
Furthermore, as mobile browsing now accounts for a signiﬁcant portion of online trafﬁc, there is increased
demand for the development of mobile-friendly websites as businesses seek to widen their reach, enhance
user satisfaction and increase retention by enhancing their mobile browsing offering. The Group’s offering
supports this dynamic by ensuring all of its built and hosted websites are responsive to scale down for
mobile and tablet interfaces as standard. The Directors also believe that many businesses are prioritising
online activities due to the global shift toward digital-ﬁrst consumer behaviour and rapid growth in the digital
economy in the UK and globally.
On 23 June 2025, the Government published its Modern Industrial Strategy for the UK, which focused on
eight industries, including both ‘digital and technologies’ and the ‘creative industries’, which includes
advertising and marketing. In this report, it noted the fastest-growing areas of the economy of the future will
be those driven by technology, with approximately half of the projected GDP growth in the coming years
being attributed to the adoption of emerging technologies. It also noted that the list of most valuable global
businesses is dominated by technology ﬁrms, with 9 in the top 15. This leads the Directors to believe that
there is signiﬁcant potential for growth in its target market as businesses of all sizes seek to bolster their
online presence.

7. GROWTH STRATEGY
The Directors believe that the web design, web development and online marketing sector offers signiﬁcant
opportunities for growth and value creation. The Directors believe that there is signiﬁcant scope to expand
the services offered to existing clients through cross selling efforts and to materially grow its client base
through increased marketing and a continuation of delivering a service to its clients that the Directors believe
is the best in kind. Combined, these initiatives will allow the Group to increase its client numbers and revenue
per client.
The Directors believe that companies who embrace web design and web development are better positioned
to meet consumer expectations and create more engaging, user-centric experiences. The Group is wellpositioned to capitalise on this opportunity, having developed a proprietary content management system
(CMS) that allows for high-margin deployment of web design for clients. The Group currently works with
over 250 web design clients, with 30 per cent. recurring revenue from associated hosting and support fees
and gross margins of over 90 per cent. in its web design business in 2024.
The Group has developed a range of web design products and associated services. These include
readymade web design, bespoke web design (Micro, Lite, Pro & Ecommerce), logo design, custom web
development solutions, copywriting and other content initiatives, and online marketing services (including
SEO). These product offerings are underpinned by the Group’s proprietary CMS which the Group believes
is best-in-class for its market niche.
The Group’s CMS also provides high scalability for growth in the web design business. The Group believes
it can scale its web design business by increasing new customer acquisitions; increasing revenue from
existing customers through cross-selling additional services; and through the continuous enhancement of
its product offerings.
The Group primarily serves small to medium-sized enterprises, start-ups, and independent professionals
across a wide range of industries – from retail and hospitality to professional services, healthcare, and
technology. Many of its clients are owner-managed businesses seeking a strong online presence without
the overheads associated with large agency fees. By tailoring its offerings to the needs of entrepreneurs
and growing ﬁrms, Smarter Web Operations has built a diverse and loyal customer base that values both
quality and transparency.
36

The Group intends to scale up the web design business by boosting its marketing efforts, through SEO,
pay-per-click, social media and other more traditional marketing techniques, and as a result of the greater
visibility of the Company as a publicly listed business.
The Group believes it has a particularly strong opportunity to scale its ‘readymade’ web design business,
beneﬁting from diminishing marginal costs with scale and large addressable market.
The United Kingdom has a strong technology industry with a deep pool of talent driving a vast number of
startups and growth businesses focusing on software development. This has given rise to a competitive
and fragmented market in software development, with companies constantly evolving and innovating to
stay at the forefront of their industry. In line with the Group’s inorganic growth strategy, the Directors believe
the Group can take advantage of the fragmented nature of the web services sector via bolt-on acquisitions
and a buy and build strategy. The Group will assess and evaluate opportunities where there is clear strategic
rationale, alignment of synergies and a suitable acquisition structure that can be negotiated.
The Group also accepts Bitcoin as a form of tender. In addition to its core web services, the Directors believe
Bitcoin represents an innovative development in ﬁnancial technology from both a transactional and
operational perspective. By accepting Bitcoin as a transactional currency, in conjunction with the Group’s
Bitcoin Treasury Policy, the Group is seeking to engage with emerging technologies and demonstrate a
proactive stance toward ﬁnancial innovation. This approach may appeal to stakeholders who value such
forward-looking practices that complement traditional business operations.

8. TREASURY OPERATIONS
The Group has adopted a Bitcoin Treasury Policy which sets out how it seeks to manage its own cash,
assets, investments and reserves. In addition, the policy outlines the key ﬁnancial and commercial risks and
the processes by which the Group will assess, monitor and mitigate these risks.
The key objectives of the policy include:
(i)

the maintenance by the Group of sufﬁcient liquid working capital (including a minimum of 12 months
operating costs plus debts falling due within 12 months) to fund the Group’s operations and meet its
obligations;

(ii)

investing surplus cash efﬁciently;

(iii)

use of approved creditworthy counterparties; and

(iv)

use of capital market tools to grow the Bitcoin held by the Group for the future beneﬁt of the Group.

The policy is approved by the Board, and the Board is responsible for reviewing any breaches and authorising
changes and, if required, remedial actions. The CEO oversees risk management, policy compliance and
implementation of remedial steps if any, and the CFO manages ﬁnancial reporting, cash ﬂow forecasting.
Under the policy, the Group operates in accordance with the following key ﬁnancial principles (which are
subject to annual review by the Board):
l

there is a clear differentiation between the commercial activities of the Group, which are run for the
beneﬁt of customers and shareholders, and the Group’s treasury management activities, which are
focused on investing the Group’s cash and Bitcoin holding;

l

the Group will deliver value for its customers and shareholders by being as efﬁcient as possible,
leveraging its scale, prudent cost management and disciplined capital allocation;

l

the Group proactively manages its liquidity and maintains cash and designates a number of Bitcoin in
easy access at call accounts equal to at least 12 months operating costs and ﬁnancial obligations;
and

l

robust treasury management practices, as set out in the policy, to ensure that the Group can monitor
compliance with the above principles, manage risks arising and implement mitigating actions as
appropriate to ensure the long-term ﬁnancial strength of the Group.

The Group accumulates Bitcoin by using surplus funds, including those generated by the trading activities
of Smarter Web Operations. As a general principle, the Group will ensure that any surplus cash, subject to
37

its minimum liquidity holding requirements, is held in Bitcoin. At present, the only approved instrument,
investment or asset which the Group may hold, other than cash, is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is custodied using a
small number of top tier custodians and not self custodied, as further detailed below. Subject to available
cash balances and in accordance with its Bitcoin Treasury Policy, the Group acquires Bitcoin through major
exchanges such as Coinbase US and Kraken and may acquire Bitcoin through Coinbase Europe Limited in
the future. With respect to any Bitcoin received directly from customers or investors, the Group, with the
assistance of anti-money laundering service providers such as SmartSearch, conducts appropriate due
diligence on the client or investor and vendor of Bitcoin. During regular meetings of the Board, the Group’s
Bitcoin Treasury Policy is reviewed and considered as appropriate to ensure compliance and that the policy
remains suitable for the business. A key priority for the Group is to manage counterparty and concentration
risks arising from its custodial relationships. The price of Bitcoin is widely quoted globally across various
markets operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Following a thorough due diligence process, the Group has established Bitcoin custody relationships with
three major custodians namely: Fidelity, Coinbase US (and related Coinbase entities), and Kraken. In case
of the US counterparties (Coinbase US and Kraken), the custody services are provided through the
custodian’s US based regulated entities. The UK counterparty (Fidelity) has discretion over which jurisdiction
the Group’s wallets are held in and there is also a small number of Bitcoin held by Coinbase Luxembourg
S.A in Luxembourg. Each of the providers that hold the Group’s Bitcoin is subject to regulatory oversight in
the jurisdiction in which they operate including compliance with their relevant anti money laundering
regulations.
Fidelity is part of Fidelity Investments, a global ﬁnancial services group with approximately US$16.4 trillion
in assets under administration (AUA) and US$6.4 trillion in discretionary assets under management (AUM)
as of 30 June 2025. Kraken is a well-established digital assets service provider. In its Q2 2025 ﬁnancial
highlights, clients entrusted the platform with US$43.2 billion in assets on the platform globally. Likewise,
Coinbase US is an established provider that is a global leader in digital assets custodial services and is used
by many of the leading US-based crypto ETFs; its shares are listed on NASDAQ with a market cap of
approximately US$81 billion. Combined, the Directors believe that three custodians provide the Group with
a robust and secure custodial framework for its Bitcoin holdings ensuring ease of access and liquidity whilst
providing diversiﬁcation of holdings.
Generally, Bitcoin is controllable only by the possessor of the unique private key relating to the digital wallet
in which the digital assets are held. Private keys must be safeguarded and kept private in order to prevent
a third party from accessing the digital assets held in such a wallet. Best practices for institutional custodians
of Bitcoin may include distributed risk custody arrangements involving multi-signature key quorums; where
each key may involve an additional layer of distributed risk via segmented keys (known as "sharded keys").
In relation to Regulatory Information Service (RIS) reporting, the policy provides that the Group must issue
RIS announcements for material changes in asset value. In particular, the Group monitors the value of its
treasury holdings and if the value of an individual component within the Group’s treasury changes in value
by more than 25 per cent. within a 24-hour period and that component amounts to more than 25 per cent.
of the total amount held in treasury (as measured in GBP) then the Group will update through RNS to
communicate this movement and any impact on its operations and ﬁnancial position.
Treasury Strategy
In establishing its Bitcoin Treasury Policy and overall strategy, the Group has monitored other quoted
companies that have employed Bitcoin treasury strategies and uses certain derived performance metrics,
in particular ‘mNAV’ and ‘Bitcoin Yield‘. mNAV is a valuation multiple that represents the ratio of the Group’s
enterprise value to the net asset value of its Bitcoin holdings at any given time. Bitcoin Yield is a key
performance indicator (KPI) that reﬂects the percentage change in the ratio of total Bitcoin holdings to
Ordinary Shares in issue (on a diluted basis) over a given period. The Board monitors the Group’s mNAV on
an ongoing basis in order to determine its ability to deploy capital into Bitcoin pursuant to its Bitcoin Treasury
Policy , with the objective of generating Bitcoin Yield.
To date, the Company has raised funds predominantly via equity placings and subscriptions for cash in
respect of its Ordinary Shares, and more recently by way of the issue of a convertible instrument for cash
which provides exposure to Bitcoin and the Company’s shares, referred to as the Smarter Convert (further
details of which are set out in paragraph 3 of Part 7 of this Document). The Bitcoin purchased in connection
38

with the Smarter Convert is reﬂected within SWC Holdings Malta Limited via an approved custodian, who
holds the assets securely on its behalf in accordance with the Group’s Bitcoin Treasury Policy.

REGULATORY FRAMEWORK AND DEVELOPMENTS IN THE UK RELATED TO DIGITAL
ASSETS
The global cryptoasset market is currently characterised by limited but developing regulatory oversight, with
ﬁrms operating in the sector currently subject to less regulation when compared to other asset classes in
traditional ﬁnancial markets. Most IOSCO members are in the process of developing and implementing
further regulation of cryptoassets with the regulation of cryptoassets now evolving in the UK.
On 28 May 2025, the FCA released two consultation papers – CP25/14 (on stablecoin issuance and crypto
custody) and CP25/15 (on prudential requirements for crypto ﬁrms). The regulatory changes implemented
by the FCA with effect from 8 October 2025 allow retail investors to buy crypto exchange traded notes
(cETNs). The Group views these changes and consultations as positive progress towards a comprehensive
UK cryptoasset regulatory regime that will strengthen the industry and protect all participants.
The Group does not itself provide custody to third parties. The Group also notes that it does not intend to
use cETNs, create its own stablecoin, carry out any custody services, or undertake any trading activities
that would require it to be otherwise regulated by the FCA under, current or stated future regulations in the
UK. To the extent there are further changes in such regulations, the Group will duly comply as required.
On 2 December 2025, The Property (Digital Assets etc) Act 2025 passed into law in the UK. This act
modernises UK property law by legally recognizing a third category of personal property for digital assets
(including cryptocurrencies, NFTs), providing owners with increased legal protection and clarity in legal cases
involving fraud or insolvency. Whilst being noteworthy in relation to the UK’s legal crypto landscape generally,
it is not anticipated to have material impact on the Group.
On 15 December 2025, the ﬁnal version of The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Cryptoassets)
Regulations 2025 was laid before both Houses of Parliament in the UK. Subject to receipt of formal approval
from both the House of Commons and the House of Lords before becoming law, which is expected to be
a formality in 2026, it is currently anticipated that the new rules will come into force from October 2027.
These new regulations will bring crypto ﬁrms under the direct supervision of the Financial Conduct Authority,
treating cryptoassets like other regulated ﬁnancial products. The following day, 16 December 2025, the FCA
released three consultation papers: (i) CP25/40: Regulating cryptoasset activities; (ii) CP25/41: Regulating
cryptoassets: Admissions & disclosures and market abuse regime for cryptoassets; and (iii) CP25/42: A
prudential regime for cryptoasset ﬁrms. These papers do not contain ﬁnal rules or guidance. They are all
open for comment until 12 February 2026 and set out the latest iteration of the FCA’s proposals and thinking
relating to implementation of a range of ﬁnancial regulatory measures connected to crypto in the UK. These
consultations will be followed (ultimately) by ﬁnal rules and guidance from the FCA which will implement the
regulatory measures needed to give effect to the architecture being introduced by the new regulations in
2027. The Group is cautiously hopeful that the new regulations are a positive development and is in any
event reviewing the regulations and the various consultations to assess the likely impact of the ﬁnal rules
and guidance (if any) on the Group. To the extent the Group will be impacted, the Group will ensure that the
appropriate steps are taken to ensure full compliance as and when required.

10. LOCK IN AND ORDERLY MARKET ARRANGEMENTS
Pursuant to a lock-in agreement entered into on 15 January 2026, between (i) the Company, (ii) Strand
Hanson, (iii) Tennyson and (iv) the Covenantors (the Lock-in Agreement), each Covenantor has undertaken
to the Company, Strand Hanson and Tennyson that they will not, and will use reasonable endeavours to
procure that their respective connective persons will not, dispose of any legal or beneﬁcial ownership of, or
interest in Ordinary Shares:
(a)

during the Lock-in Period; and

(b)

during the Orderly Market Period without the prior consultation and consent of the Company’s broker(s)
and corporate adviser(s).

Any disposal by a Covenantor during the Orderly Market Period shall be effected through Tennyson (or the
broker(s) of the Company from time to time) and in such a manner as the broker(s) and corporate adviser(s)
39

of the Company may reasonably require with a view to maintaining an orderly market. Further details of the
agreement are set out in paragraph 14 of Part 7 of this Document.

11. DIVIDEND POLICY
The Directors have no intention to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, with excess proﬁts expected to
be applied to further growth of the business or held in treasury pursuant the Group’s Bitcoin Treasury Policy.
The Company will review the dividend policy periodically, and any future payment of dividends will be subject
to maintaining an appropriate level of dividend cover and the need to retain sufﬁcient funds for reinvestment
in the business, to ﬁnance any capital expenditure and for other working capital purposes. The Group does
not currently have distributable reserves to pay dividends and there is no certainty that the Group will ever
pay a dividend.

12. COMPANY SHARE INCENTIVE SCHEME
The Directors believe that it is important for the success and growth of the Company to employ and engage
highly talented personnel and that equity incentives are available to attract, retain and motivate key
employees, directors and consultants. At the time of the Company’s Initial IPO, the Company announced
that in order to achieve that objective, the Company intended to adopt an incentive plan under which it may
award new Ordinary Shares to directors, employees and consultants pursuant to equity and incentive
schemes approved by the Board and that the Company expected to issue options of up to approximately
10 per cent. over the Ordinary Shares of the Existing Share Capital, subject to appropriate vesting and/or
performance conditions.
Accordingly, the Company plans to seek approval from shareholders for equity plans under which the
Executive Directors and other key employees will be eligible for awards of Ordinary Shares or options over
Ordinary Shares:
l

the LTIP; and

l

the CSOP, (together, the Discretionary Share Plans), which will cater for discretionary share-based
incentive awards to selected employees.

Further details shall be provided in a circular to shareholders in due course ahead of the annual general
meeting.

13. ADMISSION
The Directors have applied for the Ordinary Shares to be admitted to the equity shares (commercial
companies) category of the Ofﬁcial List and to the London Stock Exchange for the Ordinary Shares to be
admitted to trading on the Main Market.
Admission is expected to take place and unconditional dealings in the Ordinary Shares are expected to
commence on the London Stock Exchange at 8.00 a.m. on 3 February 2026. Dealings on the London
Stock Exchange before Admission will only be settled if Admission takes place. All dealings in Ordinary
Shares prior to commencement of unconditional dealings will be at the sole risk of the parties concerned.
The expected date for electronic settlement of such dealings will be 3 February 2026. All dealings between
the commencement of conditional dealings and the commencement of unconditional dealings will be on a
“when issued basis”.

14. OTHER LISTINGS
On 11 June 2025 the Company’s Ordinary Shares approved to trade on the OTCQB Venture Market in the
United States.

15. TAXATION
General information regarding UK taxation is set out in Part 6 (“Taxation“) of this Document. These details
are intended only as a general guide to the current tax position under UK taxation law. If a prospective
investor is in any doubt as to his or her tax position, he or she should consult his or her own independent
40

ﬁnancial adviser immediately. Prospective investors subject to tax in other jurisdictions are strongly urged to
contact their tax advisers about the tax consequences of holding Ordinary Shares.

16. CREST
CREST is a paperless settlement system enabling securities to be evidenced otherwise than by a certiﬁcate
and transferred otherwise than by written instrument in accordance with the CREST Regulations.
The Ordinary Shares have been enabled for CREST settlement. Accordingly, following Admission, settlement
of transactions in the Ordinary Shares may take place within the CREST system if a Shareholders so wishes.
CREST is a voluntary system and Shareholders who wish to receive and retain share certiﬁcates are able to
do so.

17. FURTHER INFORMATION AND RISK FACTORS
Prospective investors should read the whole of this Document, which provides additional information on
the Group and not rely on summaries or individual parts only. In particular, the attention of prospective
investors is drawn to the section headed “Risk Factors” in this Document which contains a summary of the
risk factors relating to an investment in the Company.

3. Corporate Governance
The Board is responsible for leading and controlling the Group and has overall authority for the management
and conduct of the Group’s business and its strategy and development.
The Board is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance.
Other than as noted below, from Admission, the Group will comply, and intends to continue to comply, with
the relevant principles and provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code.

43

The Company will report to its Shareholders on its compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code in
accordance with the UK Listing Rules.
As envisaged by the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board has established three committees: an
Audit and Risk Committee, a Remuneration Committee and a Nomination Committee. The Board has also
established a Disclosure Committee. If the need should arise, the Board may establish additional committees
as appropriate.
The UK Corporate Governance Code recommends that at least half the board of directors of a UK listed
company (excluding the Chair) should comprise “independent” non-executive directors. On Admission, the
majority of the Board will comprise Non-Executive Directors, with half of the Board, comprising Randal
Casson, Martin Thomas and Sean Wade, regarded by the Company as independent Non-Executive
Directors within the meaning of the UK Corporate Governance Code and free from any business or other
relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.
Whilst it is noted that Sean previously served as an executive director of Uranium Energy Exploration plc
(the Company’s former name prior to the reverse takeover on 24 April 2025), since that transaction Sean
has not held any executive or operational role within the Company. Furthermore, the Board considers Sean’s
shareholding to be at a level that does not compromise his independence; therefore, the Board regards
Sean as independent.
Accordingly, whilst the Company does not currently comply with the recommendation that more than half
of the Board (excluding the Chair) are independent Non-Executive Directors, the balance of the Board is
deemed to be appropriate to provide adequate corporate governance at this stage in the Company’s
development. It is, however, noted that the Company intends to comply with this requirement of the UK
Corporate Governance Code and accordingly will actively seek to appoint a further independent NonExecutive Director in due course subject to identifying appropriate candidates. If the Company has not
appointed more independent Non-Executive Directors when it publishes its next annual report it will make
appropriate disclosures and explanations regarding the composition of the Company’s Board.
The UK Corporate Governance Code recommends that the Board should appoint one of its independent
Non-Executive Directors to be the senior independent director (SID) to provide a sounding board for the
Chair and to serve as an intermediary for the other Directors when necessary. The SID should be available
to shareholders if concerns remain unresolved after contacting the Chair or the executive directors through
the normal channels, or where such channel of communication is inappropriate. The Company’s SID is
Randal Casson.
The UK Corporate Governance Code further recommends that a workforce engagement director is
appointed; being an individual that understands the Group’s and other key stakeholders’ views to be taken
into consideration in Board discussions and decision-making. The Company’s workforce engagement
director is Randal Casson.
The UK Corporate Governance Code further recommends that directors should be subject to annual reelection. The Company intends to comply with this recommendation.
In the future, the Company may seek to incentivise its Non-Executive Directors through the issue of share
options, including through the Discretionary Share Plans, provided that this does not compromise the
independence of its independent Non-Executive Directors.
The UK Corporate Governance Code recommends that the pension contribution rates for executive directors
should be aligned with those available to the workforce. At present the executive directors of the Company
are entitled to maximum employer pension contributions of 5 per cent. of qualifying earnings, and nonboard employees are entitled to maximum employer pension contributions of 3 per cent. of qualifying
earnings.

44

4. Share Dealing
The Group has adopted, with effect from Admission, a code of securities dealings in relation to the Ordinary
Shares and a policy with respect to entry into transactions with persons related to the Group which aids
compliance with the UK Market Abuse Regulation and will apply to the Directors and other relevant
employees of the Group.

5. Details of the Board Committees
5.1 Disclosure Committee
The Board has established the Disclosure Committee to ensure timely and accurate disclosure of all
information that is required to be disclosed to the market to meet the legal and regulatory obligations
and requirements arising from the listing of the Company’s securities on the London Stock Exchange,
including the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules, UK Listing Rules and the UK Market Abuse
Regulation.
The Disclosure Committee will meet at such times as shall be necessary or appropriate, as requested
by any member of the committee. Under the terms of reference for the Disclosure Committee, the
Disclosure Committee must have at least three members and at least one member must be an
Executive Director.
The initial members of the Disclosure Committee are the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, the Chief Financial
Ofﬁcer and the nominated representative of the Company Secretary. The committee is chaired by
Albert Soleiman.
5.2 Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee assists the Board in reviewing the structure, composition and make-up of
the Board and any committees of the Board, succession planning, evaluating the balance of skills,
experience, independence and knowledge on the Board and leading the process for Board
appointments and making recommendations to the Board on such matters. It is also responsible for
assisting with any evaluation process to assess the overall and individual performance of the Board
and its committees and reviewing the policies on diversity and progress on achieving objectives under
the policy.
The terms of reference of the Nomination Committee cover such issues as membership and the
frequency of meetings, as mentioned above, together with requirements for the quorum for and the
right to attend meetings, reporting responsibilities and the authority of the Nomination Committee to
carry out its duties.
The UK Corporate Governance Code recommends that a majority of the members of the Nomination
Committee should be independent Non-Executive Directors. As the UK Corporate Governance Code
does not restrict the chair of the Company from being a member of the Nomination Committee, the
Company’s three independent Non-Executive Directors (Sean Wade, Randal Casson and Martin
Thomas) will be the initial members of the Nomination Committee and the Company will comply with
the UK Corporate Governance Code recommendation.
The Nomination Committee is made up of a minimum of three members. The Nomination Committee
is chaired by Sean Wade.
The Nomination Committee will meet at least once per year and otherwise as the chair of the
committee, or a majority of the committee members, shall require.
5.3 Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee assists the Board in determining its responsibilities in relation to
remuneration, including making recommendations to the Board on the Company’s policy on
remuneration, determining the individual remuneration packages, including pension rights and any
compensation payments of each of the Company’s Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,
Chair of the Board and senior management team. The Remuneration Committee is also responsible
for considering and making recommendations to the Board with regard to the design and targets in
relation to share plans and equity incentive plans and reviewing the ongoing appropriateness and
relevance of the remuneration policies of the Company.
45

The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee cover such issues as membership and the
frequency of meetings, as mentioned above, together with requirements for the quorum for and the
right to attend meetings, reporting responsibilities and the authority of the Remuneration Committee
to carry out its duties.
The UK Corporate Governance Code, as it would apply to the Company from any Admission,
recommends that the Remuneration Committee should comprise at least two members, both of whom
should be independent Non-Executive Directors. The Chair of the Board should not be a member of
the Remuneration Committee if he was not “independent” on appointment and, in any case, should
not chair the Remuneration Committee. The chair of the Remuneration Committee is required to have
served on a remuneration committee for at least 12 months. As the UK Corporate Governance Code
does not restrict the chair of the Company from being a member of the Nomination Committee, the
Company’s three independent Non-Executive Directors (Sean Wade, Randal Casson and Martin
Thomas) will be the initial members of the Nomination Committee and the Company will comply with
the UK Corporate Governance Code recommendation.
The Remuneration Committee shall comprise a minimum of two members, who shall be independent
Non-Executive Directors. The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Randal Casson.
The Remuneration Committee will meet at least two times a year and otherwise as the chair of the
committee, or a majority of the committee members, shall require.
5.4 Audit and Risk Committee
The Audit and Risk Committee assists the Board in discharging its responsibilities with regard to
ﬁnancial reporting, external and internal audits and controls, including reviewing the Company’s annual
and half-yearly ﬁnancial statements, making recommendations on the appointment, reappointment
and removal of the external auditor, monitoring the independence of the external auditor, reviewing the
objectivity and effectiveness of the audit process and reviewing the scope of the audit and non-audit
work undertaken by the external auditor.
The terms of reference of the Audit and Risk Committee cover such issues as membership and the
frequency of meetings together with requirements for the quorum for and the right to attend meetings,
reporting responsibilities and the authority of the Audit and Risk Committee to carry out its duties. In
addition, the internal audit function has a direct reporting line to the Audit and Risk Committee. The
terms of reference also set out the authority of the committee to carry out its responsibilities.
The UK Corporate Governance Code, as it would apply to the Company from Admission, recommends
that the Audit and Risk Committee comprise at least two members who are both independent NonExecutive Directors and includes one member with recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience. The Chair
of the Board should not be a member of the Audit and Risk Committee. Randal Casson and Martin
Thomas shall be the initial members of the Audit and Risk Committee and the Company will comply
with the UK Corporate Governance Code recommendation.
The Audit and Risk Committee shall comprise a minimum of two members who shall be independent
Non-Executive Directors and at least one member must have recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience.
The Audit and Risk Committee is chaired by Randal Casson.
The Audit and Risk Committee will meet at least two times a year and otherwise as the chair of the
committee shall require and as requested by the internal or external auditor or any member of the
committee.

Part 3
Operating and Financial Review
This Part 3 should be read in conjunction with the section of this Document headed “Presentation of Financial
and Other Information“ and with Part 4 of this Document. Unless stated otherwise, the ﬁnancial information
considered in this Part 3 is extracted from the Historical Financial Information in Section B.2 of Part 4 of this
Document.
This section discusses the ﬁnancial condition and results of operations of the Group, comprising the
Company and its subsidiaries, including Smarter Web Operations. The consolidated ﬁnancial statement
covers all period presented; however, the composition of the Group changed following the acquisition of
Smarter Web Operations in April 2025. Accordingly, the interim ﬁnancial information for the period ended
31 July 2025 includes the results of Smarter Web Operations from the date of acquisition and therefore is
not directly comparable with prior years. The consolidated ﬁnancial information for the ﬁnancial years ended
31 October 2022, 31 October 2023 and 31 October 2024 and the nine-month period ended 31 July 2025
has been audited. The ﬁnancial information relating to the Group and Smarter Web Operations is derived
from the audited and reviewed ﬁnancial information incorporated by reference in accordance with Section
B.1 of Part 4 of this Document. The audited consolidated position of the Group is as included in the Interim
Financial Information in Section B.2 in Part 4 of this Document.
The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from
those that it discusses in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such
differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Document, particularly under the section
of this Document headed “Risk Factors“ and in paragraph 10 of the section headed “Presentation of Financial
and Other Information”.

1. OVERVIEW
The Group’s primary business activity is a UK-based web design agency, specialising in creating bespoke,
mobile-friendly websites. Smarter Web Operations currently offers a range of online marketing strategies to
help businesses of all sizes enhance their online presence including various web design packages, logo
design, SEO, animation, and custom development. Smarter Web Operations has traded proﬁtably since
2009. In 2022, Smarter Web Operations began accepting payment for its services in Bitcoin.
The web design business is primarily a digital services business, based in the UK and targeting small and
medium-sized clients. The business has over 250 clients most of which are based in the UK with others
based overseas.
The strength of the Group’s balance sheet in respect of its Bitcoin holdings of 2,664 as at the Date of this
Document combined with low levels of gearing, provides the Group with ample capacity to capture
opportunities as they arise both organically and inorganically.
The Group has a lean operating structure which ensures costs are optimised and managed appropriately.
Whilst costs are expected to see incremental growth in the future, driven by market factors such as salary
inﬂation and wider business expansion, the main impact on ﬁnancial performance by a large margin is the
change in fair value of the Group’s Bitcoin holdings. In addition, the growth of those holdings will be directly
impacted by management’s ability to attract capital into the business.

2. CURRENT TRADING AND OUTLOOK
The Group’s web design business has a long history of proﬁtable growth and has built a loyal client base of
over 250 clients. Revenues from the web design business continue to improve year-on-year, and
management believe there is a signiﬁcant opportunity to grow the revenue base organically through cross
selling additional services to existing clients as well as growing the client base through investment in staff
and marketing.
Approximately 30 per cent. of revenues are from re-occurring subscription services relating to website
hosting and management see a material opportunity to grow this part of the business and in capturing other
47

cross selling opportunities to improve monetisation of our existing customer base and grow revenue per
client.
The Company’s strategy to invest in the business is underway with the recruitment of additional staff since
July 2025, particularly in the marketing and business development areas. It is anticipated that this investment
will help drive growth and further expand the range of services, improving cross sell across our client base
and market penetration.
Costs have steadily increased primarily due to the listing expenses and more broadly, corporate expenses
associated with being a public company. The majority of the cost increase, other than that associated with
the Admission, relate to staff both as the Group looks to strengthen its management ranks to deliver its “10
Year Strategy” and continues to invest in growing the web design business.
Overlaying this strategy is management’s ﬁrm belief in Bitcoin as the cornerstone of a strong balance sheet
providing a hedge against inﬂation and a natural springboard to technological advancements in the global
payments infrastructure. Management continues to explore opportunities to grow the amount of Bitcoin
held in treasury.
All the Bitcoin on hand as at the balance sheet date was acquired in the current reporting period and the
Group has continued to grow its Bitcoin treasury holdings after the balance sheet date.

3. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING OPERATIONS
The Group’s ability to acquire and retain clients as well as grow the number of services used by existing
clients is fundamental to the success of the web design business. The Group operates in the small and
medium enterprise segments of the market which is more exposed to the economic environment. A
deterioration in the economy would be expected to have a disproportionate impact on this segment,
potentially limiting their capacity to spend on the Company’s services.
The Company’s business is dependent on attracting and retaining talented staff to drive its expansion and
growth. The investment being made in the web design business is primarily related to expanding the capacity
of the team to enable it to grow and service its clients more broadly.

Administrative costs include staff salaries and costs of operating a publicly listed business. The increase of
approximately £94,000 from 2024 to the nine months ended 31 July 2025 reﬂects the costs associated
with listing the Company on the AQSE Growth Market and custodial charges relating to Bitcoin holdings.
With revenue from Smarter Web Operations being consolidated only from acquisition, once administrative
costs are included, the Group generated an operating loss of £577,978.

Loss before tax
Overall, the Group generated a loss before tax for the nine months ended 31 July 2025 of £252,906 for the
period once net ﬁnance costs and other costs were included.

Net ﬁnance costs
The ﬁnance costs of £340,982 in 2025 relate to the accounting for the convertible loan notes and the
effective interest on ﬁnancial liability and a fair value loss when accounting for connected warrants. This is
treated as a one-off charge to the proﬁt and loss.
Other items in the Proﬁt and Loss Statement
Fair value gains
The Group is required to perform a fair value assessment in respect of its Bitcoin holdings for each reporting
period. Due to the volatility in the price of Bitcoin, as well as the exposure to foreign currency arising from
its pricing in US Dollars, the largest item impacting the Group’s ﬁnancial performance will be gains/losses
on cryptoassets, although this is a non cash item, until such time at which the Bitcoin is liquidated, it is
recognised in other comprehensive income. During the nine months to 31 July 2025, the total fair value
uplift attributable to the owned Bitcoin was £10,551,964.

Income tax
As stated above, the key item impacting the ﬁnancial results of the Group is the fair value assessment of
the Bitcoin held. Under UK corporations tax laws, such gains and losses are deferred until such time as
there is a disposal or other tax events. A deferred tax asset or liability is recognised in the intervening period.

Cryptocurrency relates to the Group’s Bitcoin holdings at the 31 July 2025 which has all been acquired in
the nine-month period to 31 July 2025. While Bitcoin is accounted for as an intangible asset under the
Group’s accounting policies, it is presented separately from other intangible assets given its size and nature
as a distinct material asset class. This presentation provides clearer visibility over the Group’s Bitcoin treasury
position.
Intangible assets as at 31 July 2025 primarily comprise goodwill of £1,036,594 recognised on the acquisition
of Smarter Web Operations, and identiﬁable assets including software, customer relationships and brand
arising from the purchase price allocation.
Cash and cash equivalents relate to the Group’s cash holdings in easy access at call accounts. The cash
balance has grown compared to prior years to provide the liquidity to meet the Group’s obligations and
ensure that sufﬁcient funds are kept covering operating costs for a minimum period of 12 months.
Of the total liabilities amount of £3.8 million as at 31 July 2025, a deferred tax liability relating to the unrealised
gains on the Group’s Bitcoin holdings makes up £3.5 million. All of which arose in the current reporting
period in line with the commencement of the Group’s Bitcoin treasury strategy.
The balance of liabilities mostly relate to trade creditors and the Group has no borrowings as at 31 July
2025. All borrowings were settled during the period as reﬂected in the reduction in total liabilities from
31 October 2024 to 31 July 2025 (when the deferred tax liability is excluded). This is further outlined below
in ‘Liquidity and Capital resources’.

The web design business continues to show year on year growth and with the exception of FY23, has
continued its history of annual revenue growth and positive client acquisition. For the 7 months to 31 July
2025, the business generated £206,000 of revenue and other income combined, exceeding that of the
FY24 (£203,669).
On average, circa 30 per cent. of revenue comes from re-occurring subscription fees relating to website
hosting which tends to have a higher retention rate. The business has a diverse client base of over 250 clients
mostly from the small and medium enterprise sector.
The Board believes there is signiﬁcant scope to grow the web design business and has sanctioned further
investment in that business which has commenced with the recruitment of additional staff and increased
marketing spend. Opportunities exist not only to grow the client base but to also increase cross-sell amongst
existing clients increasing the number of services utilised by each client and therefore the revenue per client.

* On acquisition of subsidiary, a merger relief reserve of £618,689 was recognised on the shares issued.

The Group anticipates that it will generate cash through additional capital raises in the equity markets and
cash ﬂow from its core business. The Group will pursue capital raising options available to it from time to
time including the issuance of new ordinary shares, convertible loan notes and other instruments such as
preferred equity, as the Directors deem suitable to further the Group’s strategy.
The Group does not currently utilise non-equity linked debt instruments and has not historically accessed
the debt markets. Low levels of gearing and a strong balance sheet provide the Company with ample
opportunity to pursue debt ﬁnancing should the Board deem it suitable to do so, however, this is not
something that is currently being considered by the Directors.
The Company manages its cash reserves efﬁciently and in conjunction with its Bitcoin Treasury Policy. Capital
expenditure is minimal and outside of minor computer equipment for staff, the Company does not have any
plans for large scale capital expenditure.
As outlined above, the Company retains funds in easy access at call accounts as working capital to cover
at a minimum, 12 months of anticipated operating costs and ﬁnancial obligations.
The Smarter Web Company Operations Limited
Smarter Web Operations is cashﬂow positive on a standalone basis and has sufﬁcient cash resources to
fund its operations. The business model is asset and resource light, and the entity has operated proﬁtably
for many years. In addition, Smarter Web Operations has access to the liquidity and capital resources of
the Company to fund future growth plans as the Board deems appropriate.
It is not envisaged that Smarter Web Operations would seek external sources of funding.

53

7. SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENTS
Since 31 July 2025, the Group has continued to progress its funding strategy and execute its Bitcoin
Treasury Policy. Post-period activity under the Group’s existing funding arrangements has continued, and
the Group has taken further steps to support the administration and segregation of assets relating to the
Smarter Convert facility. These actions form part of the Group’s broader capital management approach and
long-term objectives.
Further detail on post-period developments is provided under paragraph 8, Part 3 of this Document below,
and information on additional Bitcoin acquired and the value since the reporting date of these holdings is
set out in paragraph 10, Part 3 of this Document.

8. TREND INFORMATION
Whilst the Company has yet to develop formal performance related metrics, the performance of the business
and the execution of the strategy is closely monitored by the Directors. Speciﬁc performance measures and
ﬁnancial targets will be set as part of the forecasting and budgeting process for the current ﬁnancial year.
For information about recent trends impacting the current trading of the Group, see “Current Trading and
Outlook” above.
For information about recent trends impacting the global web development market, see “Market Opportunity”
at paragraph 6 of Part 1 of this Document.
Since 31 July 2025, no additional signiﬁcant changes in the ﬁnancial performance of the Group has occurred,
other than the developments outlined below and those otherwise disclosed in paragraph 10, Part 3 of this
Document.
9. CAPITAL RAISING
Since 31 July 2025, the Group undertook the following equity raises:
l

31 July 2025 – 17 November 2025: 15,701,586 Ordinary Shares placed, raising £22,350,784 in
respect of subscriptions placed under the ATM Facility and Second ATM Facility

l

7 August 2025: 3,959,906 Ordinary Shares placed, raising £8,113,847 in respect of a placing and
subscription announced on 4 August 2025

l

9 October 2025: 9,680,640 Ordinary Shares placed, raising £9,670,959 in respect of a placing
announced on 6 October 2025

l

13-14 January 2026: 3,265,000 Ordinary Shares placed pursuant to the Third ATM Facility
raising £1,643,813.

As at the date of this Document (unaudited), the Group had issued a total of 84,640,546 new Ordinary
Shares since 31 July 2025.

10. ADDITIONAL BITCOIN ACQUIRED
Since the nine month period ended 31 July 2025, the Group has acquired 614 additional Bitcoin, increasing
total Bitcoin holdings to 2,664 Bitcoin as at the date of this Document (unaudited). However, Bitcoin has
experienced a decline in value since the reporting date of approximately 24 per cent. (to 9 January 2026)
and is trading below the Group’s average purchase price resulting in an unrealised loss of £40.3 million in
relation to the Group’s Bitcoin holdings.

11. INCORPORATION OF A SUBSIDIARY
On 20 October 2025, SWC Holdings Malta Limited was incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company. The entity was established primarily to support the administration of the Smarter Convert
instrument and to ensure appropriate segregation of Bitcoin and related assets acquired under that facility.
SWC Holdings Malta Limited also provides the Group with a presence within the European Union supporting
broader operational and strategic positioning.

legal names Teathers Financials plc, which was subsequently changed to Uranium Energy Exploration plc

Dear Directors,
Admission of the fully paid ordinary shares of The Smarter Web Company PLC (“SWC” or “the
Company”) to the Equity Shares Commercial Companies category of the Ofﬁcial List of the
Financial Conduct Authority and to trading on the London Stock Exchange’s Main Market for
listed securities (“LSE Main Market”) (“the Proposed Transaction”)
We report on the Interim Financial Information of The Smarter Web Company PLC and its subsidiaries (“the
Group”) set out in Section B2.2 of Part 4 of this Document, which comprises the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position, the consolidated statement of
changes in equity, the consolidated statement of cashﬂows, and the related notes, for the nine months
ended 31 July 2025, (“Interim Financial Information”).
We have not audited or reviewed the comparative periods for the nine month period ended 31 July 2024
and year ended 31 October 2024, which have been included for comparative purposes only, and accordingly
do not express an opinion thereon.

Opinion on the Interim Financial Information
In our opinion, the Interim Financial Information gives, for the purpose of the prospectus of the Company
dated 16 January 2026, a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and its subsidiaries as at
31 July 2025 and of its proﬁts, cash ﬂows and changes in equity for the period then ended in accordance
with UK-adopted international accounting standards.

Responsibilities
The Directors of the Company are responsible for preparing the Interim Financial Information in accordance
with UK-adopted international accounting standards.
It is our responsibility to form an opinion on the Interim Financial Information and to report our opinion to you.
Save for any responsibility arising under 5.3.2R(2)(f) of the Prospectus Regulation Rules to any person as
and to the extent there provided, to the fullest extent permitted by law we do not assume any responsibility
and will not accept any liability to any other person for any loss suffered by any such other person as a
result of, arising out of, or in connection with this report or our statement, required by and given solely for
57

the purposes of complying with item 1.3 of annex 1 of the Prospectus Regulation, consenting to its inclusion
in the Prospectus.

Basis of preparation
The Interim Financial Information has been prepared for inclusion in the prospectus of the Company dated
16 January 2026 on the basis of the accounting policies set out in note 2 to the Interim Financial Information.
The report is required by item 18.3.1 of annex 1 of the Prospectus Regulation and is given for the purpose
of complying with that paragraph and for no other purpose.

Basis of opinion
We conducted our work in accordance with Standards of Investment Reporting issued by the Financial
Reporting Council (“FRC”) in the United Kingdom. We are independent of the Company and Group in
accordance with the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to Investment Circular Reporting Engagements, and
we have fulﬁlled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
Our work included an assessment of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the Interim
Financial Information. It also included an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by
those responsible for the preparation of the Interim Financial Information and whether the accounting policies
are appropriate to the entity’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our work so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we
considered necessary in order to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the
Interim Financial Information is free from material misstatement whether caused by fraud or other irregularity
or error.
Our work has not been carried out in accordance with auditing or other standards and practices generally
accepted in other jurisdictions outside the United Kingdom and accordingly should not be relied upon as if
it had been carried out in accordance with those standards and practices.

Conclusions relating to going concern
We have not identiﬁed any material uncertainty related to events or conditions that, individually or collectively,
may cast signiﬁcant doubt on the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a period of at
least twelve months from the date of the Prospectus.
Accordingly, the use by the directors of the Company of the going concern basis of accounting in the
preparation of the Interim Financial Information is appropriate.

Declaration
For the purposes of Prospectus Regulation Rules PRR 5.3.2R(2)(f) we are responsible for this report as part
of the prospectus and we declare that, to the best of our knowledge, the information contained in this report
is in accordance with the facts and that the report makes no omission likely to affect its import. This
declaration is included in the prospectus in compliance with item 1.2 of annex 1 of the Prospectus
Regulation.
Yours faithfully

Notes to the Interim Financial Information
For the nine months ended 31 July 2025
1. General information
The Smarter Web Company PLC (the “Company”), formerly Uranium Energy Exploration Plc, and all its
subsidiaries (together, the “Group”) are incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The Company is
a public limited company, the address of the registered ofﬁce is 160 Aztec West, Almondsbury, Bristol,
United Kingdom, BS32 4TU.
On 25 April 2025, the Company acquired the entire issued share capital of The Smarter Web Company
Operations Limited (“Smarter Web Operations”) and listed on the Aquis Stock Exchange. Details of the
acquisition are included in note 29.

2. Basis of preparation
The Interim Financial Information for the nine-month period to 31 July 2025 has been prepared in accordance
with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards (UK- IAS). The Interim Financial Information has been
prepared for the purposes of the Prospectus only and does not constitute statutory accounts within the
meaning of section 434 of the Companies Act 2006.
This Interim Financial Information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated annual ﬁnancial
statements for the year ended 31 October 2024, which were prepared in accordance with UK-adopted
International Accounting Standards.
The comparative ﬁnancial information for the year ended 31 October 2024 does not constitute the
Company’s statutory accounts for that year but is derived from those accounts. Statutory accounts for the
year ended 31 October 2024 have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the
independent auditors on those ﬁnancial statements was unqualiﬁed, drew attention to a material uncertainty
relating to going concern and did not contain a statement under Sections 498 (2) or (3) of the Companies
Act 2006.
The Interim Financial Information is prepared in Pound Sterling which is also the functional currency of all
entities in the Group.
The Interim Financial Information for the period ended 31 July 2025 has been audited by the reporting
accountant. The comparative period to 31 July 2024 is unaudited.
The Interim Financial Information has also been prepared under the historical cost convention, except as
modiﬁed for assets and liabilities recognised at fair value.
Going concern
As at 31 July 2025 the Group had a cash balance of £1,140,847 (31 October 2024: £109,252), and net
assets of £179,925,724 (31 October 2024: net liabilities £921,384).
The Directors have considered the applicability of the going concern basis in the preparation of this Interim
Financial Information. This included the review of internal budgets and ﬁnancial results which show, taking
into account reasonably probable changes in ﬁnancial performance that the Group should be able to operate
within the level of its current funding arrangements.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will have ample resources to continue in
operation for the foreseeable future, underpinned by the successful completion of several fundraises during
the period, which have further strengthened the Group’s liquidity position. For this reason, they have adopted
the going concern basis in the preparation of this Interim Financial Information.

63

3. Material accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of this Interim Financial Information are consistent with
those followed in the preparation of the consolidated annual ﬁnancial statements for the year ended
31 October 2024.
(a) Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company is exposed to, or
has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns
through its power over the entity.
The Interim Financial Information incorporate the results of business combinations using the acquisition
method. In the consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position, the acquiree’s identiﬁable assets and liabilities
are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date. The results of acquired operations are
included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date on which control is obtained.
They are deconsolidated from the date on which control ceases.
Intragroup balances, and any gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions,
are eliminated in preparing the Interim Financial Information.
(b) Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts
receivable for services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts and VAT.
The Group’s revenue arises from the provision of website development services. Revenue is recognised by
reference to the stage of completion of the contract. The stage of completion of a contract is measured by
comparing the costs incurred for work performed to date to the total estimated contract costs. Revenue is
only recognised to the extent of recoverable expenses when the outcome of a contract cannot be estimated
reliably.
(c) Employee beneﬁts: pension obligations
The Group operates a deﬁned contribution plan for its employees. A deﬁned contribution plan is a pension
plan under which the Group pays ﬁxed contributions into a separate entity. Once the contributions have
been paid the Group has no further payment obligations.
The contributions are recognised as an expense in proﬁt or loss when they fall due. If contribution payments
exceed the contribution due for service, the excess is recognised as a prepayment.
(d) Other expenses
Other expense comprises net gains and losses on instruments held at fair value through proﬁt or loss and
loans written off during the period.
(e) Finance costs
Finance costs comprise of interest payable on leases and other ﬁnancial liabilities which are expensed in
the period in which they are incurred.
(f)
Taxation
Corporation tax for the period presented comprises current and deferred tax.
Current and deferred tax are recognised in proﬁt or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised
in other comprehensive income, in which case they are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable proﬁt for the period. Taxable proﬁt differs from net proﬁt as
reported in proﬁt or loss because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in
other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current
64

tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting
period.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities in Interim Financial Information and the corresponding tax bases used in the
computation of taxable proﬁt and is accounted for using the liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the
extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁts will be available against which deductible temporary differences
can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the
initial recognition (other than in a business combination or for transactions that give rise to equal taxable
and deductible temporary differences) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the
taxable proﬁt nor the accounting proﬁt. In addition, a deferred tax liability is not recognised if the temporary
difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent
that it is no longer probable that sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to
be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the
liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively
enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax
assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation
authority and the group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
(g) Share-based payments
Equity-settled share-based payment transactions with parties other than employees are measured at the
fair value of the goods or services received, except where that fair value cannot be estimated reliably, in
which case they are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments granted, measured at the date the
entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders the service. The share-based payment expense is
either recognised in proﬁt or loss or recognised as deduction in share premium. A corresponding increase
in the warrant reserve is also recognised.
(h)

Financial assets

Classiﬁcation
The Group classiﬁes its ﬁnancial assets into two categories, being ﬁnancial assets held at amortised cost
and ﬁnancial assets held at fair value through proﬁt or loss.
Amortised cost
Financial assets held at amortised cost comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
These assets are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
an active market. They arise principally through the provision of goods and services to customers (e.g.,
trade receivables) but also incorporate other types of ﬁnancial assets where the objective is to hold their
assets in order to collect contractual cash ﬂows and the contractual cash ﬂows are solely payments of the
principal and interest. They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly
attributable to their acquisition or issue and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective
interest rate method, less provision for impairment.
Impairment provisions for trade and other receivables are recognised based on the simpliﬁed approach
within IFRS 9 using the lifetime expected credit losses (“ECL”) method. During this process the probability
of the non-payment of the receivables is assessed. This probability is then multiplied by the amount of the
expected loss arising from default to determine the lifetime ECL for the receivables. For trade and other
receivables, which are reported net, such provisions are recorded in a separate provision account with the
loss being recognised within administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive

65

income. On conﬁrmation that the trade or other receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value
of the asset is written off against the associated provision.
Fair value through proﬁt or loss
Financial assets held at fair value through proﬁt or loss comprise equity investments. These are carried in
the statement of ﬁnancial position at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, changes in fair value are
recognised in proﬁt or loss.
(i)
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise of balances held in current bank accounts and payment processors,
readily available for use in the Group’s operations.
(j)
Financial liabilities
The Group’s non-derivative ﬁnancial liabilities comprise of trade and other payables and borrowing and are
recognised initially at fair value based on amounts exchanged, net of transaction costs and subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Borrowings are classiﬁed as current liabilities
unless, at the end of the reporting period, the group has a right to defer settlement of the liability for at least
12 months after the reporting period.
(k) Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after
deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognised at the proceeds
received, net of direct issue costs.
(l)
Compound instruments
The component parts of convertible loan notes issued by the Group are classiﬁed separately as ﬁnancial
liabilities and equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the deﬁnitions
of a ﬁnancial liability and an equity instrument. A conversion option that will be settled by the exchange of a
ﬁxed amount of cash or another ﬁnancial asset for a ﬁxed number of equity instruments issued by the Group
is an equity instrument.
(m) Cryptocurrency
The Group’s holding in Bitcoin is accounted for as an intangible asset with an indeﬁnite useful economic
life. Bitcoin is traded in an active market and the Directors have adopted the revaluation measurement
model.
Bitcoin purchases are initially recognised at cost and are subsequently re-valued to fair value based on the
market price provided by the Group’s cryptocurrency brokers. Increases in the carrying amounts arising on
revaluation are recognised, net of tax, in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the revaluation
reserve in equity. To the extent that the increase reverses a decrease previously recognised in proﬁt or loss,
the increase is ﬁrst recognised in proﬁt or loss. Decreases that reverse previous increases of the same asset
are ﬁrst recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent of the remaining surplus attributable to the
asset. All other decreases are charged to proﬁt or loss.
On disposal, any associated revaluation surplus is transferred directly to retained earnings and is not recycled
through proﬁt or loss.
Cryptocurrency is held for long term appreciation in line with the Group’s treasury policy and therefore is
classiﬁed as a non-current asset in the consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position.

66

(n)

Other intangible assets

Goodwill
Goodwill represents the amount by which the fair value of the cost of a business combination exceeds the
fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortised and is stated at cost less any accumulated
impairment losses.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is tested for impairment annually or when events or changes in
circumstance indicate that it might be impaired. Impairment charges are deducted from the carrying value
and recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. For the purpose of
impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to beneﬁt
from synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the
carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated ﬁrst to reduce the carrying amount of any
goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying
amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent
period.
Acquisition related intangible assets
Net assets acquired as part of a business combination includes an assessment of the fair value of separately
identiﬁable acquisition-related intangible assets, in addition to other assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities
purchased. These are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful lives which are individually assessed.
The intangible assets acquired by the Group in a business combination, and their useful economic lives and
the methods used to determine the cost of each intangible are as follows:
Amortisation period of intangible assets
Intangible asset
Amortisation period
Brand
15 years
Customer relationships
15 years
Software
15 years
(o) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Deprecation is recognised
so as to write off the cost of assets less their residual values over their useful lives on the following basis:
Fixtures and ﬁttings

10% straight-line basis

(p) Right-of-use asset
The Group recognises right-of-use assets under lease agreements in which it is the lessee. The underlying
asset comprises a motor vehicle and is used in the normal course of business. The right-of-use asset is
initially measured at the present value of lease payments made at or before the commencement date as
well as any initial direct costs and an estimate of costs to be incurred in dismantling the asset. Lease
incentives are deducted from the cost of the right-of-use asset.
The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the lease-term and if necessary impaired in accordance with
applicable standards.
(q) Lease liabilities
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that
date, discounted using the rate implicit in the lease. The lease liability is subsequently measure by increasing
the carrying amount to reﬂect interest on the lease liability (application of the effective interest method) and
by reducing the carrying amount to reﬂect the lease payments made. No lease modiﬁcation or reassessment
changes have been made during the reporting period from changes in any lease terms or rent charges.

67

(r)

Equity

Share capital
Share capital represents the nominal value of ordinary equity shares.
Share premium
Share premium represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for equity
shares. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new equity shares are deducted from the share
premium account.
Merger relief reserve
Merger relief reserve represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for
equity shares issued by the Company as part of an acquisition of subsidiary, where merger relief under
section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 applies.
Revaluation reserve
Revaluation reserve represents the excess over cost of the fair value of the Group’s cryptocurrency holdings.
Warrant reserve
Warrant reserve represents the fair value of outstanding warrants as at the date of issue by the Company.
Accumulated losses
Accumulated losses consist of cumulative net gains and losses recognised in the consolidated statement
of comprehensive income plus transactions recognised directly in equity.
(s) Operating segments
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief
operating decision-maker (“CODM”). The CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing
performance of the operating segments, has been identiﬁed as the Board of Directors that makes strategic
decisions. The Group consists of one operating segment, being the provision of website development
services and therefore no segmental reporting is presented.

4. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
In the application of the accounting policies, which are described in note 3, the Directors are required to
make judgements, estimates and assumptions which affect reported income, expenses, assets, liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates and associated assumptions are based
on historical experience, expectations of future events and other factors that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results in the future could differ from such estimates. The estimates and
underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the period in which the revision is made.

(a)

Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies

Accounting for warrants attached to convertible loan notes
Warrants that were issued in conjunction with the conversion of convertible loan notes (see note 21) have
been accounted for from the date of conversion when the terms of instruments were determined, as
opposed to the date of inception of the loans. On conversion and issue of the warrants, the warrants met
the deﬁnition of equity instruments under IAS 32, and accordingly, were recognised in the warrant reserve
at fair value with a corresponding reduction in share premium.

68

(b)

Key sources of estimated uncertainty

Identiﬁable assets and liabilities assumed on acquisition of subsidiary
The fair value of intangible assets acquired through business combinations involves the use of valuation
techniques and the estimation of future cash ﬂows to be generated over a number of years. Management
is still assessing and will adjust the provisional fair values to recognise identiﬁed intangible assets at year
end, in line with paragraph 46 of IFRS 3. Further details of the business combination in the period are
included in note 29.

In February 2025, the Company issued convertible loan notes (“CLN”) to various pre-IPO investors, totalling
£1,356,752 who had originally subscribed for shares in the Company in connection with a previous aborted
IPO. The loan notes entitled the holders to receive shares on IPO at a 20 per cent. discount to the IPO price,
along with one warrant for each share received. The loan notes had the option to be redeemed in cash in
the event of a default. The loan notes mandatorily converted to shares on IPO date, being 25 April 2025.
The effective interest on the ﬁnancial liability element of the loan note is recorded as a ﬁnance cost of
£339,188 On IPO, the terms of the warrants were ﬁnalised and entitled the warrant holders to subscribe for
additional shares at ﬁxed price, the IPO price, leading to the warrants being recognised as equity instruments
at fair value. The value of the warrants issued totals £833,306 and is recognised in equity in the Warrant
Reserve, with the corresponding reduction in share premium as part of IPO share issue costs.
The loan from Power Metal Resources Plc (“POW”) was written off during the period ended 31 July 2025
with the corresponding gain recognised in other income in proﬁt or loss. The loan from POW was provided
in connection with an acquisition opportunity related to an asset owned by POW, however the transaction
ultimately did not complete and the loan was written off. At the time of the write-off, Sean Wade was the
chief executive ofﬁcer of both POW and the Company however he did not have a controlling interest in
either company.
The Convertible loan facility was also repaid during the period. Other borrowings consisted of pre-IPO
investors who were either repaid or reﬁnanced into CLN.

The Group has recognised a deferred tax asset of £47,598 in relation to trading losses incurred in the period
which can be offset against future realised gains on crypto assets. The deferred tax in relation to the losses
has therefore been offset against the corresponding deferred tax liability. As at 31 July 2025, the Group has
unused tax losses of £2,404,886 (31 October 2024: £1,637,660). Deferred tax has been recognised at
25 per cent., which is the enacted corporation tax rate in the UK that is expected to be applied in the future.

Financial instruments exclude prepayments, VAT, taxation and social security liability balances.
There is no material differences between the carrying value and fair value of the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments
carried at amortised cost because of their short maturities.
All ﬁnancial instruments are denominated in GBP.

(b) Fair value hierarchy
Some of the Group’s ﬁnancial assets are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Valuation
techniques in determining the fair values are divided into three levels based on the quality of inputs.
There were no transfers between fair value hierarchies in the period ended 31 July 2025. (2024: None)
Level 1 – Quoted market prices
Fair value is determined by reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active
markets where the quoted price is readily available.
The following ﬁnancial assets are recognised in this Interim Financial Information at fair value through proﬁt
or loss and are classiﬁed within the level 1 category:

––––––––––––––

Level 2 – Valuation techniques using observable inputs
Fair value is determined using inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are unobservable,
directly or indirectly.
Level 3 – Valuation techniques using signiﬁcant unobservable inputs
Fair value is dependent on signiﬁcant inputs that are unobservable.
As at 31 July 2025, the Group had no ﬁnancial instruments carried at fair value where the fair value is
estimated using level 2 or level 3 inputs.

(c) Risk management
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk
management framework. The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the
78

risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to
limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reﬂect changes in market conditions
and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training, management standards and procedures, aims
to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles
and obligations.
The main ﬁnancial risks arising from the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments are market risk, credit risk and liquidity
risk.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of ﬁnancial loss if a customer or counterparty to a ﬁnancial instrument fails to meet its
contractual obligations.
The carrying amount of ﬁnancial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. For the Group, credit risk
arises primarily from cash balances held at banks and other receivables. The risk in relation to cash balances
is mitigated by using only reputable ﬁnancial institutions with a high credit rating.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that the Company and its subsidiaries might encounter difﬁculty in
settling its debts or otherwise meeting its obligations related to ﬁnancial liabilities.
The Company manages this risk by monitoring its ﬁnancial resources and carefully planning its expenditure
programmes. The Group has successfully raised ﬁnance and the Directors consider the Group’s investment
in cryptocurrencies to be highly liquid.
The Group has no external borrowings and all liabilities except for leases are due to be settled within a year.
The Group’s motor vehicle lease runs out in November 2028 with total remaining payments under the lease
as at 31 July 2025 of £39,938.
Other risks
The Group is not materially exposed to currency and interest rate risk. The Group’s market risk exposure is
limited to price ﬂuctuations in the value of Bitcoin, which it monitors closely and does not generally rely on
to fund working capital requirements. The Group’s remaining investment in listed securities is minimal and
not considered material.

(d) Capital risk management
The Board’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern, to enable the Group to continue its principal activities, and to maintain an optimal capital structure
to reduce the cost of capital. The Group has no external borrowing and thus capital consists entirely of
equity.

31. Events after the reporting date
Subsequent to the reporting date, the Company entered into a number of material ﬁnancing transactions.
On 6 August 2025, the Company announced the launch of “Smarter Convert”, a Bitcoin-denominated
convertible bond that was fully subscribed for US$21 million (approximately £15.8 million at the date of
receipt). The Company was required to use the proceeds received to acquire Bitcoin and to hold it at a
segregated wallet. The instrument is interest free and at any time prior to 5 August 2026, the note holders
have the right to convert all or any portion of their notes into Company shares at a price of £2.0475 per share.
On 5 August 2026, the note holders have the right to choose one of the following options: (i) receive the
Bitcoin acquired on conversion, (ii) receive the ﬁat equivalent of the value of Bitcoin acquired on conversion
(net of transaction fees) converted to GBP, USD, or EUR, or (iii) receive such number of ordinary shares of
the Company equal to the size amount of the outstanding loan notes converted at a price of £2.0475 per
share. The Company also retains a “Forced Settlement Right” after 5 February 2026, exercisable only if both
the market price of the Company shares exceeds 150 per cent. of £2.0475 per Ordinary Share for 10
consecutive trading days, and the percentage increase in the Company’s share price over that period
exceeds the percentage increase in the price of Bitcoin.
On 4 August 2025, the Company announced a Placing with an institutional investor and a Subscription with
a high-net-worth individual at a price of £2.05 per share. As part of this transaction, the Company issued

Admission of these ordinary shares to trading on AQSE became effective on 7 August 2025.
On 3 September 2025, the Company also entered into a subscription agreement with Shard Merchant

shares undertaken by Shard. Admission of the shares to trading took place on 9 September 2025.
In addition, on 6 October 2025 the Company announced a placing that raised gross proceeds of
£9.68 million through the issue of 9,680,640 new ordinary shares at £1.00 per share. Each share carries an
associated warrant exercisable at £1.50 for a period of 36 months, subject to a share-price performance
condition. Admission of these shares to trading occurred on 9 October 2025.
On 23 December 2025, the Company entered into a new subscription agreement with Shard Merchant
Capital Ltd, replacing the subscription agreement entered into on 4 September 2025. The agreement
provides for the issue of 50,000,000 new ordinary shares at par value and also covers 13,240,500 ordinary
shares previously issued and not yet sold, resulting in an aggregate available allocation of 63,240,500
ordinary shares. Under the agreement, Shard Merchant Capital Ltd may sell ordinary shares on behalf of
the Company subject to agreed restrictions, including weekly volume limits linked to market trading closing
price, and the Company’s ability to suspend or recommence sales at its discretion, with the Company
entitled to receive approximately 98.25 per cent. of the gross proceeds from any shares sold. Admission to
trading of the new ordinary shares took place on 2 January 2026.
On 15 January 2026, the Company announced that 3,265,000 ordinary shares had been placed pursuant
to the Third ATM Facility raising net proceeds of approximately £1,643,813.

Part 6
Taxation

Taxation in the UK
The following information is based on UK tax law and His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) practice
currently in force in the UK. Such law and practice (including, without limitation, rates of tax) is subject to change
at any time. The information that follows is for guidance purposes only. Any person who is in any doubt about
his or her position should contact their professional adviser without delay. The tax legislation of an investor’s
country tax residence may have an impact on the income received from an investment in the Ordinary Shares.

Tax treatment of UK investors
The following information, which relates only to UK taxation, is applicable to persons who are resident in
the UK for tax purposes and who beneﬁcially own Ordinary Shares as investments and not as securities to
be realised in the course of a trade. It is based on the law and practice currently in force in the UK. The
information is not exhaustive and does not apply to potential investors:
l

who intend to acquire, or may acquire (either on their own or together with persons with whom they
are connected or associated for tax purposes), more than 10 per cent., of any of the classes of shares
in the Company; or

l

who intend to acquire Ordinary Shares as part of tax avoidance arrangements; or

l

who are in any doubt as to their taxation position.

Such Shareholders should consult their professional advisers without delay. Shareholders should note that
tax law and interpretation can change and that, in particular, the levels, basis of and reliefs from taxation
may change. Such changes may alter the beneﬁts of investment in the Company.
Shareholders who are neither resident nor temporarily non-resident in the UK and who do not carry on a
trade, profession or vocation through a branch, agency or permanent establishment in the UK with which
the Ordinary Shares are connected, will not normally be liable to UK taxation on dividends paid by the
Company or on capital gains arising on the sale or other disposal of Ordinary Shares. Such Shareholders
should consult their own tax advisers concerning their tax liabilities.
Dividends
Where the Company pays dividends, no UK withholding taxes are deducted at source. Shareholders who
are resident in the UK for tax purposes will, depending on their circumstances, be liable to UK income tax
or corporation tax on those dividends.
UK resident individual Shareholders who hold their Ordinary Shares as investments, may be subject to UK
income tax on the amount of dividends received from the Company. Individuals currently have a £500 per
annum tax-free dividend allowance. Dividends falling within this allowance will effectively be taxed at zero per
cent. but such dividends will still count as taxable income when determining how much of the basic rate
band or higher rate band has been used. Dividend receipts in excess of this amount (to the extent that they
are not covered by the personal allowance of £12,570) are currently taxed (in the tax year ending 5 April
2025 and 5 April 2026) at 8.75 per cent. for basic rate taxpayers, 33.75 per cent. for higher rate taxpayers
and 39.35 per cent. for additional rate taxpayers. From April 2026, the basic rate will increase to
10.75 per cent. and higher rate will rise to 35.75 per cent. the additional rate will remain unchanged.
Shareholders who are subject to UK corporation tax should generally, and subject to certain anti-avoidance
provisions, be able to claim exemption from UK corporation tax in respect of any dividend received but will
not be entitled to claim relief in respect of any underlying tax.
Disposals of Ordinary Shares
Any gain arising on the sale, redemption or other disposal of Ordinary Shares will be taxed at the time of
such sale, redemption or disposal as a capital gain.
88

UK resident individual Shareholders will be subject to capital gains tax to the extent their net gains exceed
the annual exempt amount of £3,000 from 6 April 2024 after taking account of any other available reliefs,
the rate of capital gains tax on disposal of Ordinary Shares by basic rate taxpayers is 18 per cent., and
24 per cent. for upper rate and additional rate taxpayers.
The corporation tax rate applicable to taxable proﬁts is currently 25 per cent. applying to proﬁts over
£250,000. A small proﬁts rate applies for companies with proﬁts of £50,000 or less so that these companies
pay corporation tax at 19 per cent. Companies with proﬁts between £50,000 and £250,000 pay tax at the
main rate reduced by a marginal relief providing a gradual increase in the effective corporation tax rate. The
corporation tax rate thresholds are reduced where there are associated companies or periods shorter than
12 months.
Further information for Shareholders subject to UK income tax and capital gains tax
“Transactions in securities”
The attention of Shareholders (whether corporates or individuals) within the scope of UK taxation is drawn
to the provisions set out in, respectively, Part 15 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 and Chapter 1 of Part 13
of the Income Tax Act 2007, which (in each case) give powers to HMRC to raise tax assessments so as to
cancel “tax advantages” derived from certain prescribed “transactions in securities”.

Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax
The statements below are intended as a general guide to the current position. They do not apply to certain
intermediaries who are not liable to stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax or (except where stated otherwise)
to persons connected with depositary arrangements or clearance services who may be liable at a higher
rate.
No UK stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax will be payable on the allotment and issue of Ordinary Shares
pursuant to a placing.
Most investors will purchase existing Ordinary Shares using the CREST paperless clearance system and
these acquisitions will be subject to stamp duty reserve tax at 0.5 per cent. Where Ordinary Shares are
acquired using paper (i.e. non-electronic settlement) stamp duty will become payable at 0.5 per cent. if the
purchase consideration exceeds £1,000.
The above comments are intended as a guide to the general stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax
positions and may not relate to persons such as charities, market makers, brokers, dealers, intermediaries
and persons connected with depositary arrangements or clearance services to whom special rules apply.

Inheritance tax
Shareholders regardless of their tax status should seek independent professional advice when considering
any event which may give rise to an inheritance tax charge.
Ordinary Shares beneﬁcially owned by an individual Shareholder will be subject to UK inheritance tax on the
death of the Shareholder (even if the Shareholder is not a long term resident in the UK); although the
availability of exemptions and reliefs may mean that in some circumstances there is no actual tax liability. A
lifetime transfer of assets to another individual or trust may also be subject to UK inheritance tax based on
the loss of value to the donor, although again exemptions and reliefs may be relevant. Particular rules apply
to gifts where the donor reserves or retains some beneﬁt.
THIS SUMMARY OF UK TAXATION ISSUES CAN ONLY PROVIDE A GENERAL OVERVIEW OF
THESE AREAS AND IT IS NOT A DESCRIPTION OF ALL THE TAX CONSIDERATIONS THAT MAY
BE RELEVANT TO A DECISION TO INVEST IN THE COMPANY. THE SUMMARY OF CERTAIN UK
TAX ISSUES IS BASED ON THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN FORCE AS OF THE DATE OF THIS
DOCUMENT AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO ANY CHANGES IN UK LAWS OCCURRING AFTER SUCH
DATE. LEGAL ADVICE SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH REGARD TO INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES.
ANY PERSON WHO IS IN ANY DOUBT AS TO THEIR TAX POSITION OR WHERE THEY ARE
RESIDENT, OR OTHERWISE SUBJECT TO TAXATION, IN A JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE
UK, SHOULD CONSULT THEIR PROFESSIONAL ADVISER.

(c)

2,450,000 Adviser Warrants;

(d)

8,000,000 Maxim Warrants; and

(e)

1,680,640 Placing Warrants.

Further details of the Warrants are set out below.
Seller Warrants, CLN Warrants and Adviser Warrants
The Seller Warrants, CLN Warrants and Adviser Warrants were created pursuant to warrant deeds dated
24 April 2025 on substantively the same terms. Each such warrant grants the holder the right to subscribe
for Ordinary Shares at a price of 2.5p per warrant. The Warrants are exercisable (in whole or in part(s)) on
and from the ﬁrst anniversary of the Initial IPO until the third anniversary of Initial IPO (i.e. from 24 April 2026
until 24 April 2028).
The exercise price and number of Ordinary Shares which may be issued under these Warrants are subject
to adjustment in the event of any allotment or issue of fully paid shares by way of capitalisation or proﬁts or
reserves or subdivision or consolidation of the Ordinary Shares and any such adjustment will be certiﬁed by
the Company’s auditors. Holders are entitled to participate in subsequent rights offerings and pro rata
distributions as if they held the underlying shares without exercising their warrants.
The CLN Warrant held by 210k Capital L.P. and the Adviser Warrant held by Peterhouse Capital Limited
are freely transferable without restrictions. Certain of the CLN Warrants (being those held by JT Management
Group Ltd, 123 Accounting Solutions Limited and Keysford Limited) are freely transferable subject to the
following restrictions: (a) only transferable in whole and not in parts; (b) transfers must be made using a
standard or board-approved instrument; (c) the Board may refuse registration unless proper documentation
is provided; and (d) non-compliant transfers are void.
The Seller Warrants are not transferable other than with the consent of the Company. If consent is granted,
they are transferable subject to the following restrictions: (a) only transferable in whole and not in parts;
(b) transfers must be made using a standard or board-approved instrument; (c) the Board may refuse
registration unless proper documentation is provided; and (d) non-compliant transfers are void.
91

Maxim Warrants
The Maxim Warrants were constituted pursuant to a warrant instrument dated 9 October 2025. The Maxim
Warrants grant the holders the right to subscribe for Ordinary Shares at a price of £1.50 per Maxim Warrant.
The Maxim Warrants are exercisable (in whole or in part(s)) on and from 9 October 2025 until 9 October
2028.
The Company may, at any time after the initial period of 12 months ending on 9 October 2026, call for the
conversion of any unexercised Maxim Warrants into Ordinary Shares for a consideration equal to £4.50 per
Ordinary Share, provided that (i) the VWAP of the Ordinary Shares exceeds 300 per cent. of the exercise
price for ten consecutive trading days and (ii) the holder is not in possession of material non-public
information provided by the Company. A call notice must be issued within one trading day of the expiration
of the ten consecutive trading days, and Maxim Warrants not exercised by the twentieth trading day following
receipt of the call notice will be deemed exercised. The call is subject to the Company having honoured all
notices of exercise, maintaining an effective registration statement, ensuring Ordinary Shares are listed on
a recognised market, and having sufﬁcient authorised share capital. Calls must be made rateably among
holders and may be issued in respect of any remaining uncalled Maxim Warrants.
The exercise price and number of shares issued under the Maxim Warrant are subject to adjustment in the
event of stock dividends, splits, combinations, reclassiﬁcation, or similar events to ensure the aggregate
exercise price remains unchanged. Maxim Warrant holders are entitled to participate in subsequent rights
offerings and pro rata distributions as if they held the underlying shares without exercising their warrant. In
the event of a fundamental transaction (including mergers, asset sales, tender offers, or changes in control),
the holder may elect to receive equivalent securities or consideration, or require the Company or successor
entity to purchase the Maxim Warrant at its “Black Scholes Value” calculated per the Maxim warrant
instrument. The Company must notify Maxim Warrant holders of any adjustments or corporate actions
affecting the Maxim Warrants and may voluntarily reduce the exercise price with holder consent. All
calculations are made to the nearest penny or 1/100th of a share.
Maxim Warrants are transferable by the holder, subject to applicable securities laws and any restrictions set
out in the subscription and placing agreement with Maxim Group LLC and related documents. Upon transfer,
the holder must surrender each Maxim Warrant being transferred to the Company, following which it will be
cancelled, at which time the Company shall execute and issue a new Maxim Warrant to the assignee. The
Company is not required to register transfers unless required by law and may request customary
documentation to conﬁrm compliance with transfer restrictions. Holders undertake that they will only transfer
the Maxim Warrants to qualifying investors within the meaning given in Article 2(e) of the Prospectus
Regulation Rules.
The Maxim Warrants also include an obligation on the holder to supply the Company with sufﬁcient
information for the Company to verify the identity of the holder and its signiﬁcant underlying beneﬁcial owners,
source of wealth and source of funds.
Placing Warrants
The Placing Warrants were constituted pursuant to a warrant instrument dated 8 October 2025. The Placing
Warrants grant the holders the right to subscribe for Ordinary Shares at a price of £1.50 per Placing Warrant.
The Placing Warrants are exercisable (in whole or in part) on and from 9 October 2025 until 9 October 2028.
The Company may, at any time after the initial period of 12 months ending on 9 October 2026, call for the
conversion of any unexercised Placing Warrants for a consideration equal to £4.50 per share under the
Placing Warrant, provided that (i) the VWAP of the Ordinary Shares exceeds 300 per cent. of the exercise
price for ten consecutive trading days and (ii) the holder is not in possession of material non-public
information provided by the Company. A call notice must be issued within one trading day of the ten
consecutive trading days, and Placing Warrants not exercised by the twentieth trading day following receipt
of the call notice will be deemed exercised. The call is subject to the Company having honoured all notices
of exercise received by 4.00 p.m. on the call date. Calls must be made rateably among holders and may be
issued in respect of any remaining uncalled Placing Warrants.
The exercise price and number of shares under the Placing Warrant are subject to adjustment in the event
of any allotment or issue of fully paid shares by way of capitalisation or proﬁts or reserves or subdivision or
consolidation of the Ordinary Shares and any such adjustment will be certiﬁed by the Company’s auditors.
92

Placing Warrants are transferable in whole (not in part) by the warrant holder, subject to the same restrictions
on transferability of Ordinary Shares. Transfers must be notiﬁed and registered and comply with the Articles.
Warrant holders holding at least 10 per cent. of the Placing Warrants may convene a meeting of those
Warrant holders and rights attaching to the Warrants may only be modiﬁed with the consent of 75 per cent.
of the relevant Warrant holders and the prior written consent of the Company. The warrant instrument is
governed by the laws of England.
Convertible Loan Notes
The Company has issued loan notes with an aggregate value of £15,803,732.67, which if fully converted,
would convert into a total of 7,718,551 Ordinary Shares.
Further details of the convertible loan notes are set out below.
Convertible Loan Note Instrument – “Smarter Convert Notes”
On 5 August 2025, the Company constituted and issued zero-coupon loan notes in the Company with a value
of £15,803,732.67 by way of a convertible loan note instrument, which were subscribed for by entities related
to the TOBAM Group, being TOBAM Bitcoin Alpha Fund, TOBAM BITCOIN Enhanced Fund and TOBAM
Bitcoin Treasury Opportunities Fund (together TOBAM). The loan notes are repayable on 5 August 2026.
The notes do not accrue interest and the notes may be subscribed for in either ﬁat currency or Bitcoin.
TOBAM subscribed in ﬁat currency.
Where ﬁat currency is used, the Company is required to convert not less than 98 per cent. of the relevant
subscription amount into Bitcoin within one Business Day of receipt. The Company used the funds
subscribed for the notes to acquire 177.8909127 Bitcoin (Acquired Bitcoin). Under the terms of the notes,
the Company is required to hold the Acquired Bitcoin in a segregated wallet (or otherwise in a manner that
maintains sufﬁcient Bitcoin to meet its obligations under the instrument) and they must be transferred within
three months of 5 August 2025 to a newly created, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company designated
as an insolvency-protected vehicle. On 6 November 2025, the obligations under the instrument were
transferred to SWC Holdings Malta Limited.
At any time prior to 5 August 2026, the note holders have the right to convert all or any portion of their notes
into Ordinary Shares at a price of £2.0475 per Ordinary Share.
On 5 August 2026, the note holders have the right to choose one of the following options: (i) receive the
Acquired Bitcoin from the Group; (ii) receive the ﬁat equivalent of the value of Acquired Bitcoin at the time
of repayment (net of transaction fees) converted to GBP, USD, or EUR; or (iii) receive such number of Ordinary
Shares of the Company equal to the size amount of the outstanding loan notes converted at a price of
£2.0475 per Ordinary Share
The Company also retains a “Forced Settlement Right” after 5 February 2026, exercisable only if both the
market price of the Ordinary Shares exceeds 150 per cent. of £2.0475 per Ordinary Share for 10 consecutive
trading days, and the percentage increase in the Company’s share price over that period exceeds the
percentage increase in the price of Bitcoin.
Other than as set out in this paragraph 3 above, as at the date of this Document, there are no acquisition
rights and/or obligations over authorised but unissued capital or undertakings to increase the capital of the
Company.

4. Articles of Association
The Articles contain provisions to the following effect.
Objects
The Company is incorporated as a public company limited by shares under the Companies Act 2006. The
Articles do not specify detailed objects and therefore the Company has unrestricted objects.

93

Share class rights
The rights attached to shares may be altered either with the consent in writing of the Shareholders
representing at least three-quarters of the nominal value of the issued shares of that class, or with the
sanction of a special resolution at a separate meeting of the Shareholders of shares of that class.
Transfer of shares
Subject to the Articles, a Shareholder may transfer all or any of their shares:
(a)

in the case of certiﬁcated shares, by an instrument of transfer in writing in any usual form or another
form approved by the Board, signed by or on behalf of the transferor and, in the case of partly paid
shares, by or on behalf of the transferee; or

(b)

in the case of uncertiﬁcated shares, without a written instrument in accordance with the CREST
Regulations.

Additionally, the Board may refuse to register a transfer of certiﬁcated shares unless:
(a)

The instrument of transfer is properly stamped or certiﬁed (or otherwise shown to the Board’s
satisfaction to be exempt from stamp duty), and is submitted to the Company at its registered ofﬁce
or another location determined by the Board, along with the relevant share certiﬁcate (unless the
Company was not required to issue one) and any other evidence the Board may require to verify the
transferor’s authority or the authority of the person signing on their behalf.

(b)

All shares being transferred are fully paid and of the same class.

(c)

The transfer is to a single transferee or no more than four joint transferees, each being a natural or
legal person.

(d)

The transfer relates to only one class of share.

Dividends and other distributions
The Company may by ordinary resolution declare a dividend. A dividend shall not be declared unless the
Board has made a recommendation as to its amount. Subject to the Companies Act, the Board may resolve
that the Company pay an interim dividend and may resolve that the Company pay any dividend payable on
any shares at a ﬁxed rate at intervals set by the Board.
Dividends on shares are to be paid in proportion to the amounts paid up on their nominal value (otherwise
than in advance of calls), or otherwise in accordance with the terms of issue relating to dividend entitlement.
A share may be issued on the terms that it will ranks if fully or partly paid and from a particular date. Any
unclaimed dividends shall, after the requisite notices have been given to the shareholder, be employed in
the business of the Company or invested as the Directors see ﬁt. If a dividend remains unclaimed for 12 years
from the date it was declared or became payable, it will either be transferred to an authorised reclaim fund
(as deﬁned in the Dormant Assets Act 2022), in which case the Company will be released from any further
liability in respect of that dividend, or, if the Directors determine that such a transfer is not legally permissible,
it will be forfeited and will belong to the Company, with no further liability to the Shareholder or any other
person who might have been entitled to it.
Where the Company’s share capital is divided into different classes, no interim dividend may be paid on
shares with deferred or non-preferred rights if any preferential dividend is in arrears at the time of payment.
The Directors will not be liable to Shareholders of shares with preferred rights for any loss resulting from the
payment of an interim dividend on shares with non-preferred or deferred rights, provided they act in good
faith.
Voting rights
The Ordinary Shares confer on each holder of Ordinary Shares the right to receive notice of and to attend,
speak and vote at all general meeting of the Company. Each holder of a Share who is present in person or
by proxy at any general meeting will have on a show of hands one vote and on a poll every such holder who
is present in person or by proxy will have one vote in respect of each Share held by them.
The Deferred Shares do not entitle the holders any right to receive notice of, or attend speak and vote at
any general meeting of the Company.
94

Pre-emption rights in offers for subscription of securities of the same class
The Articles do not contain speciﬁc pre-emption rights. The Board may offer, allot, grant options over or
otherwise dispose of shares in the Company, or offer, allot or issue instruments or securities with the right
to convert to shares in the Company, in each case to such persons and on such terms as it may decide,
subject to the statutory pre-emption rights contained in the Companies Act, the UK Listing Rules, the
Prospectus Regulation Rules and any other legislation applicable to the Company.
Rights to share in the Company’s proﬁts
The holders of shares are entitled to receive and participate in any distributions of dividends in the manner
set out in the Articles (and as summarised above).
Rights to share in any surplus in the event of liquidation
On winding up, the Company’s distributable assets will be shared among Shareholders in proportion to the
to the nominal amounts of capital paid up on their shares, subject to the terms of issue of or rights attached
to any shares, subject to company law.
Redemption provisions
Subject to the Companies Act (and other applicable legislation binding on the Company) and to any rights
conferred on the holders of any class of shares, the Company may purchase any of its own shares (including
any redeemable shares) and may hold such shares in treasury or cancel them.
Deferred Shares may be redeemed or purchased by the Company at any time at its option for one penny
for all the Deferred Shares registered in the name of any holder without obtaining the sanction of the holders.
Conversion provisions
Subject to the provisions of the Articles, the Companies Act (and other applicable legislation binding on the
Company), the Board may offer, allot or issue instruments or securities with the right to convert to shares in
the Company on such terms as it may decide.
General meetings
Each Shareholder present at a general meeting, either in person or by proxy, is entitled to one vote on a
show of hands. The appointment of a proxy will not prevent a Shareholder from attending, voting or speaking
at the meeting. General meetings may be attended via electronic forums in accordance with the Articles.
Unless the chairman directs otherwise, voting shall be carried out on a poll. On a poll, each Shareholder
has one vote per share held. In the case of joint Shareholders, only the vote of the most senior, as listed ﬁrst
in the register of Shareholders, will be counted.
The Board must convene annual general meetings in accordance with company law and may choose to
hold them physically, electronically, or as a hybrid. General meetings other than annual ones may be called
at any time and place the Board considers appropriate.
Notice of a general meeting must be given to all Shareholders entitled to receive it, as well as to the Directors
and auditors, in accordance with the Articles and applicable legislation. The notice must specify the meeting’s
location (including any satellite venues) and, if held electronically, provide all necessary access and security
details.
A Shareholder entitled to attend and vote may appoint one or more proxies (in respect of different shares)
to attend, speak, and vote on their behalf. Corporate Shareholders may authorise one or more
representatives to act on their behalf at a general meeting, and the Board may request evidence of such
authority.
Interests in Shares not disclosed to the Company
If a Shareholder (or someone appearing to be interested in their shares) fails to respond to a notice under
section 793 of the Companies Act within 14 days, the Shareholder loses the right to attend or vote at general
meetings for those shares.
95

If the shares represent at least 0.25 per cent. of their class, the Company may also withhold dividends,
disallow scrip dividend elections, and refuse to register transfers unless the Shareholder proves that they
are not in default and the transfer is to an unconnected third party, such as through a takeover offer, a
recognised exchange, or a full sale of the beneﬁcial interest.
Lien and forfeiture
The Company has a ﬁrst lien on each partly paid share for all amounts owed in respect of that share, whether
due or not. If any such amount becomes payable and remains unpaid for 14 days after notice is given, the
Board may sell the share to recover the debt, provided the notice stated the amount due and notiﬁed the
Shareholder of the potential sale.
Subject to the terms of issue, the Board may call on Shareholders to pay any unpaid amounts on their
shares, giving at least 14 days’ notice. If payment is not made by the due date, the Board may issue a
further 14-day notice requiring payment of the outstanding amount, plus any interest and costs. The notice
must specify where payment is to be made and state that failure to comply may result in forfeiture of the
shares.
Board powers
The Board manages the Company’s business and may exercise all powers which are not required to be
exercised or done by the Company in general meeting, subject to company law, the Articles, and any special
resolution of the Company.
The Board may delegate any of its powers to individuals or committees, on terms and for periods it considers
appropriate. It may also allow sub-delegation, retain the right to act alongside delegates, and revoke or
amend any delegation at any time.
Directors – appointment, retirement and removal
The Company must have at least two Directors, with no maximum unless set by ordinary resolution. The
Board or the Shareholders (by ordinary resolution) may appoint a Director, provided notice is given and, if
not Board-recommended, the nominee conﬁrms their willingness to act at least seven days before the
meeting.
At each annual general meeting, Directors appointed since the last annual general meeting and those still
in ofﬁce on a date set by the Board (no more than 14 days before the notice) is to be proposed for election
as a director, and each other Director is to be proposed for re-election as a director.
If a Director’s re-election is not approved, they remain in ofﬁce until a replacement is appointed by the
meeting, or until the end of the meeting (if the meeting fails to do so). If no Directors remain at the end of
the annual general meeting, those affected continue to be Directors for the purposes of calling a general
meeting to appoint new Directors and to comply with legal or regulatory duties.
The Company may remove a Director before the expiration of his period of ofﬁce by special resolution or by
ordinary resolution with special notice.
Directors – fees and remuneration
The total fees for Non-Executive Directors shall be determined by the Board. The aggregate fees may be
divided as it sees ﬁt or equally if no decision is made. Directors are entitled to reimbursement for expenses
properly incurred in carrying out their duties, including professional fees. The Board may also provide
pensions, retirement beneﬁts, or other allowances to current or former Directors and their dependants in
accordance with the Articles.
Directors’ interest
The Directors may authorise a conﬂict of interest under section 175 of the Companies Act on terms it
considers appropriate. This may include allowing the conﬂicted Director to withhold conﬁdential information
obtained outside their role as Director, where disclosure would breach a duty of conﬁdence and the conﬂict
and third party have been disclosed to the Board. The Directors may also permit the conﬂicted Director to
96

be excluded from discussions or documents relating to the conﬂict, where they reasonably believe a conﬂict
exists. The Board may withdraw or amend such authorisation at any time by giving notice to the Director.
Where the Directors have authorised a conﬂict, the conﬂicted Director is not required to account to the
Company for any proﬁt, remuneration, or beneﬁt derived from their involvement in any relevant arrangement
or transaction with the Company or in which the Company has an interest. This also applies to holding
another ofﬁce or position with the Company (other than as auditor), acting in a professional capacity for the
Company or a related body corporate (excluding as auditor), or being a director, ofﬁcer, employee, or
otherwise interested in a company in which the Group has an interest. This exemption applies provided the
Director has disclosed any required interest under the Companies Act. Directors or former Directors are
also not accountable for beneﬁts provided to them or their dependants under the Articles.

20. Mandatory bids and compulsory acquisition rules relating to Ordinary Shares
Other than as provided by the Takeover Code and Chapter 28 of the Companies Act, there are no rules or
provisions relating to mandatory bids and/or squeeze-out and sell-out rules relating to the Group.

112

Rule 9 of the Takeover Code
(a) The City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (Takeover Code) administered by the Panel on Takeovers
and Mergers (Panel) applies to the Group. Under Rule 9 of the Takeover Code, any person who
acquires an interest in shares which, taken together with shares in which that person or any person
acting in concert with that person is interested, carry 30 per cent. or more of the voting rights of a
company which is subject to the Takeover Code is normally required to make an offer to all the
remaining shareholders to acquire their shares.
(b)

Similarly, when any person, together with persons acting in concert with that person, is interested in
shares which in the aggregate carry not less than 30 per cent. of the voting rights of such a company
but does not hold shares carrying more than 50 per cent. of the voting rights of the company, an offer
will normally be required if such person or any person acting in concert with that person acquires a
further interest in shares which increases the percentage of shares carrying voting rights in which that
person is interested.

(c)

An offer under Rule 9 must be made in cash at the highest price paid by the person required to make
the offer, or any person acting in concert with such person, for any interest in shares of the company
during the 12 months prior to the announcement of the offer.

(d)

Under the Takeover Code, shareholders in a private company who in connection with an initial public
offering of that company become shareholders in a company to which the Takeover Code applies
(such as the Company) will generally be presumed to be acting in concert with each other.

(e)

When a company redeems or purchases its own voting shares, under Rule 37 of the Takeover Code,
any resulting increase in the percentage of shares carrying voting rights in which a person or group of
persons acting in concert is interested is treated as an acquisition of interests in shares which is relevant
for the purpose of Rule 9. Rule 37 provides that, subject to prior consultation, the Panel will normally
waive any resulting obligation to make a general offer if there is a vote of independent shareholders
and a procedure on the lines of that set out in Appendix 1 of the Takeover Code is followed.

(f)

The Company may, at future annual general meetings, seek the customary shareholder authority to
make on-market purchases of its own shares. In seeking any such authority, Rule 37 would apply but
the Company would seek a waiver from the Panel of the resulting Rule 9 obligation to make a general
offer, subject to a vote of independent shareholders.

Authority of the Company to redeem or purchase its own shares
When a company redeems or purchases its own voting shares, under Rule 37 of the Takeover Code, any
resulting increase in the percentage of shares carrying voting rights in which a person or group of persons
acting in concert is interested will be treated as an acquisition for the purpose of Rule 9 of the Takeover
Code. Rule 37 of the Takeover Code provides that, subject to prior consultation, the Panel will normally
waive any resulting obligation to make a general offer if there is a vote of independent shareholders and a
procedure along the lines of that set out in Appendix 1 to the Takeover Code is followed. Appendix 1 to the
Takeover Code sets out the procedure which should be followed in obtaining that consent of independent
shareholders. Under Note 1 on Rule 37 of the Takeover Code, a person who comes to exceed the limits in
Rule 9.1 in consequence of a company’s redemption or purchase of its own shares will not normally incur
an obligation to make a mandatory offer unless that person is a director, or the relationship of the person
with any one or more of the directors is such that the person is, or is presumed to be, acting in concert with
any of the directors. However, there is no presumption that all the directors (or any two or more directors)
are acting in concert solely by reason of a proposed redemption or purchase by the Company of its own
shares, or the decision to seek shareholders’ authority for any such redemption or purchase.
Under Note 2 on Rule 37 of the Takeover Code, the exception in Note 1 on Rule 37 described above will
not apply, and an obligation to make a mandatory offer may therefore be imposed, if a person (or any relevant
member of a group of persons acting in concert) has acquired an interest in shares at a time when they had
reason to believe that such a redemption or purchase of its own shares by the Company would take place.
Note 2 will not normally be relevant unless the relevant person knows that a redemption or purchase for
which requisite shareholder authority exists is being, or is likely to be, implemented (whether in whole or
in part).
The Panel must be consulted in advance in any case where Rule 9 of the Takeover Code might be relevant.
This will include any case where a person or group of persons acting in concert is interested in shares
113

carrying 30 per cent. or more but do not hold shares carrying more than 50 per cent. of the voting rights of
the Company, or may become interested in 30 per cent. or more on full implementation of the proposed
purchase by the Company of its own shares. In addition, the Panel should always be consulted if the
aggregate interests in shares of the directors and any other persons acting in concert, or presumed to be
acting in concert, with any of the directors amount to 30 per cent. or more, or may be increased to
30 per cent. or more on full implementation of the proposed purchase by the Company of its own shares.
Squeeze-out rules
Under the Companies Act, if a “takeover offer” (as deﬁned in Section 974 of the Companies Act) is made
by an offeror to acquire all of the shares in the Company not already owned by it and the offeror were to
acquire, or unconditionally contract to acquire, not less than 90 per cent. in value of the shares to which
such offer relates, the offeror could then compulsorily acquire the remaining shares. The offeror would do
so by sending a notice to the outstanding members informing them that it will compulsorily acquire their
shares and, six weeks later, it would deliver a transfer of the outstanding shares in its favour to the Company
which would execute the transfers on behalf of the relevant members, and pay the consideration for the
outstanding shares to the Company which would hold the consideration on trust for the relevant members.
The consideration offered to the members whose shares are compulsorily acquired under this procedure
must, in general, be the same as the consideration that was available under the original offer unless a
member can show that the offer value is unfair.
Sell-out
The Companies Act also gives minority members a right to be bought out in certain circumstances by an
offeror who has made a takeover offer. If a takeover offer related to all the shares in the Company and, at
any time before the end of the period within which the offer could be accepted, the offeror held or had
agreed to acquire not less than 90 per cent. in value of the shares and not less than 90 per cent. of the
voting rights carried by the shares in the Company, any holder of shares to which the offer related who had
not accepted the offer could by a written communication to the offeror require it to acquire those shares.
The offeror would be required to give any member notice of his or her right to be bought out within one
month of that right arising. The offeror may impose a time limit on the rights of minority members to be
bought out, but that period cannot end less than three months after the end of the acceptance period or, if
later, three months from the date on which notice is served on members notifying them of their sell-out
rights. If a member exercises his or her rights, the offeror is entitled and bound to acquire those shares on
the terms of the offer or on such other terms as may be agreed.
Concert Party
At the time of the Initial IPO the Company agreed with the Panel that the Founders, due to their personal
and business relationships, and Smarter Web Operations, were acting in concert in relation to the Company
and this remains the case as at the date of this Document. No other current Shareholders in the Company,
are considered by the Directors to be acting in concert with any other current Shareholder in the Company.
