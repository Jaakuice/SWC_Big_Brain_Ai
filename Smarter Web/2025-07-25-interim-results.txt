The Smarter Web Company Plc
Chief Executive Officer’s Statement
For the six months ended 30 April 2025
The Smarter Web Company PLC listed (“the Company”) on the Aquis Stock Exchange on 25 April 2025 and this
interim period mostly covers a time prior to the successful listing. Today, The Smarter Web Company is the
largest stock on Aquis, the most liquid stock on Aquis and in the Directors view, the most successful IPO (“initial
public offering”) in UK history.
The financial and operational activity within the reporting period does not reflect the current position, scale, or
strategic direction of the Company. The release of these results is a regulatory requirement and provides limited
insight into the exciting and transformative developments that have taken place since our admission to the
public markets.
The progress of the operating business has been in line with management expectations in the first half. Since
the last audited accounts for the wholly owned operating business for year ended 31 December 2024 and in the
current interim period prior to the acquisition (from 1 January 2025 to 30 April 2025), the operating business
had a turnover of £176,000 with a net profit before tax of £93,000. Whilst this is a modest profit, we are focused
on growing this side of the business in the years to come.
Our acquisition strategy is a medium to long term strategy, and we have been exploring a variety of possibilities.
Alongside our core business, we believe that Bitcoin is the best asset the world has ever seen and because of
this we use Bitcoin as a treasury asset for capital being held for future business needs.
Since our IPO, we have raised well over £100 million in equity capital, with no debt (other than a small director
loan repaid post-period end), positioning us exceptionally well to pursue our long-term vision. Our balance sheet
strength, technological assets and Bitcoin treasury demonstrate the scale of ambition we are executing postperiod end.
As of 24 July 2025, The Smarter Web Company PLC holds the following key treasury assets:
•

Over £1 million in cash with no debt obligations;

•

1,825 Bitcoin, with a value of approximately £160 million, reflecting our confidence in the long-term
potential of Bitcoin

Looking ahead, we are optimistic about the opportunities that lie before us. Our post-period progress has been
substantial, and we are only at the beginning of a long-term growth journey. I look forward to updating
shareholders further as we continue to build momentum and deliver on our vision to become a leading force.
Finally, I would like to thank all the shareholders that have supported us to date along with my colleagues who
are working relentlessly on the goal of making The Smarter Web Company PLC into one of the largest public
companies in the UK.

The Smarter Web Company Plc
Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
For the six months ended 30 April 2025
1. General information
The Smarter Web Company Plc (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) is incorporated and domiciled
in England and Wales. The Company is a public limited company, the address of the registered office is 160 Aztec
West, Almondsbury, Bristol, United Kingdom, BS32 4TU.
On 25 April 2025, the Company acquired the entire shareholding of The Smarter Web Company Ltd.
2. Basis of preparation
These consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International
Accounting Standard IAS 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” and are presented on a condensed basis. They do not
constitute statutory accounts as defined in s434 of the Companies Act 2006.
The interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated annual financial statements
for the year ended 31 October 2024, which were prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International
Accounting Standards, and the public announcements made by the Company during the interim period, in
particular the Admission Document dated 25 April 2025 which are available on the Company’s website.

The interim financial statements are presented in pounds sterling (“GBP”/”£”) because that is the currency
of the primary economic environment in which the company operates.
The interim financial information for the six months ended 30 April 2025 and 2024 have not been audited or
reviewed by the auditors. The comparative financial information for the year ended 31 October 2024 has been
derived from the audited financial statements for that period. A copy of those statutory financial statements for
the year ended 31 October 2024 has been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the independent
auditors on those financial statements was unqualified, drew attention to a material uncertainty relating to going
concern and did not contain a statement under Sections 498 (2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006.
Going concern
As at 30 April 2025 the Group had a cash balance of £1,340,198 (31 October 2024: £109,252), and net assets of
£3,163,596 (31 October 2024: net liabilities £921,384).
The Directors have considered the applicability of the going concern basis in the preparation of these interim
financial statements. This included the review of internal budgets and financial results which show, taking into
account reasonably probable changes in financial performance that the Group should be able to operate within
the level of its current funding arrangements.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will have ample resources to continue in operation
for the foreseeable future, underpinned by the successful completion of several fundraises since the period end,
which have further strengthened the Group’s liquidity position. For this reason, they have adopted the going
concern basis in the preparation of the interim financial statements.
3. Accounting policies
Basis of Consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company is exposed to, or has rights
to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its
power over the entity.
The interim financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the acquisition method.
In the condensed consolidated statement of financial position, the acquiree’s identifiable assets and liabilities are
initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date. The results of acquired operations are included in
the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date on which control is obtained.
They are deconsolidated from the date on which control ceases.

The Smarter Web Company Plc
Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
For the six months ended 30 April 2025
3. Accounting policies (continued)
Intragroup balances, and any gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are
eliminated in preparing the interim financial statements.
Financial assets
Classification
The Group classifies its financial assets into one category, being financial assets held at amortised cost.
Amortised cost
Financial assets held at amortised cost comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an
active market. They arise principally through the provision of goods and services to customers (e.g., trade
receivables) but also incorporate other types of financial assets where the objective is to hold their assets in order
to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual cash flows are solely payments of the principal and interest.
They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or
issue and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for
impairment.
Impairment provisions for trade and other receivables are recognised based on the simplified approach within
IFRS 9 using the lifetime expected credit losses (“ECL”) method. During this process the probability of the nonpayment of the receivables is assessed. This probability is then multiplied by the amount of the expected loss
arising from default to determine the lifetime ECL for the receivables. For trade and other receivables, which are
reported net, such provisions are recorded in a separate provision account with the loss being recognised within
administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income. On confirmation
that the trade or other receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against
the associated provision.
Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognise a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it
transfers the asset and substantially all the risk and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the amount by which the fair value of the cost of a business combination exceeds the fair
value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortised and is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment
losses.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is tested for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstance
indicate that it might be impaired. Impairment charges are deducted from the carrying value and recognised
immediately in the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income. For the purpose of impairment
testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from synergies of
the combination. If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the
unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and
then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An
impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Bitcoin
Bitcoin is accounted for as an intangible asset with indefinite useful lives and measured at fair value with
revaluation gains or losses recognised in other comprehensive income or profit or loss, respectively. Fair value is
determined by reference to an active market at the reporting date.

Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
For the six months ended 30 April 2025
3. Accounting policies (continued)
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less depreciation. Deprecation is recognised so as to write off
the cost of assets less their residual values, with the expected value of zero, over their useful lives on the following
basis:
Fixtures and fittings

10% straight-line basis

Right-of-use asset
The Group recognises right-of-use assets under lease agreements in which it is the lessee. The underlying asset
comprises a motor vehicle and is used in the normal course of business. The right-of-use asset is initially measured
at the present value of lease payments made at or before the commencement date as well as any initial direct
costs and an estimate of costs to be incurred in dismantling the asset. Lease incentives are deducted from the cost
of the right-of-use asset.
The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the lease-term and if necessary impaired in accordance with applicable
standards.
Lease liabilities
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date,
discounted using the rate implicit in the lease. The lease liability is subsequently measure by increasing the carrying
amount to reflect interest on the lease liability (application of the effective interest method) and by reducing the
carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made. No lease modification or reassessment changes have been
made during the reporting period from changes in any lease terms or rent charges.
Financial liabilities
The Group classifies its financial liabilities into one category, being other financial liabilities measured at amortised
cost.
Trade and other payables
Financial liabilities included in trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial
recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Accounts payable are
classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the
business if longer). If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently
carried at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption
value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings, using the effective interest
method.
Convertible loan note
Convertible loan notes are regarded as compound instruments, consisting of a liability component and an equity
component. The component parts of compound instruments are classified separately as financial liabilities and
equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement. At the date of issue, the fair value of the
liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for a similar non-convertible instrument.
This amount is recorded as a liability on an amortised cost basis until extinguished upon conversion or at the
instrument’s maturity date. The equity component is determined by deducting the amount of the liability
component from the fair value of the compound instrument as a whole. This is recognised and included in equity,
net of income tax effects, and is not subsequently remeasured.

3. Accounting policies (continued)
Foreign currencies
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of each entity are recorded at the exchange rate on
the date the transaction occurred. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such
transactions, and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year
end exchange rates, are recognised in profit or loss.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
For the six months ended 30 April 2025 and the comparative period end, the Directors do not consider that they
have made any significant estimates or judgements which would materially affect the balances and results
reported in these financial statements.
Identifiable assets and liabilities assumed
The fair value of intangible assets acquired through business combinations involves the use of valuation
techniques and the estimation of future cash flows to be generated over a number of years. Management is still
assessing and will adjust the provisional fair values to recognise identified intangible assets at year end, in line
with paragraph 46 of IFRS 3.
Warrants
Accounting for equity-settled share-based payment awards required the use of valuation models to estimate the
future share price performance of the Company. These models require management to make assumptions
regarding the share price volatility, risk free rate and expected life of awards in order to determine the fair values
of the awards at grant date.
Warrants that were issued in conjunction with the conversion of loan notes (see note 18), were initially classified
as derivative financial liabilities at the date of the loan note agreements, with no value due to the obligation being
wholly within the Company’s control. On conversion and issue of the warrants, the warrants meet the definition
of equity instruments under IAS 32, and accordingly, the warrants were reclassified from liabilities to equity with
the fair value recognised in reserves, with no subsequent revaluation required.

7. Loss per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to equity holders of the Company by the
weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue during the year. Prior year earnings per share have been
restated to reflect a 10-for-1 share consolidation completed on 1 March 2024. As the Group is loss making, the
effect of instruments that convert into Ordinary shares is considered anti-dilutive.
The weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below:

assets, each lease is reflected on the condensed consolidated statement of financial position as a right-of-use asset
(note 12) and a lease liability.
The Group has recognised 1 motor vehicle lease in the six months ended 30 April 2025. Property leases relate to
sites that are used as offices as part of the Group’s normal operation. There are no variable payments or extension
and termination options in existence that require recognition under IFRS 16.
All future cashflows are included. The leases are not subject to rent reviews.
The Group has used the interest rate implicit in the lease for the motor vehicle lease where the capital value is
readily available. For motor vehicles, the Companies have used an incremental borrowing rate of 5.48%, reflecting
the interest rate that would be considered to be available on borrowing from third party lenders on similar assets.
The Leases do not include any residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.
