fraudulent misstatement.

Important Information: Bitcoin Treasury
The Smarter Web Company Plc (the Company) holds treasury reserves and surplus cash in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency or cryptoasset.
Whilst the Board of Directors of the Company considers holding Bitcoin to be in the best interests of the Company, the Board remains aware that the
financial regulator in the UK (the Financial Conduct Authority or FCA) considers investment in Bitcoin to be high risk. At the outset, it is important to
note that an investment in the Company is not an investment in Bitcoin, either directly or by proxy. However, the Board of Directors of the Company
consider Bitcoin to be an appropriate store of value and growth for the Company’s reserves and, accordingly, the Company is materially exposed to
Bitcoin. Such an approach is innovative, and the Board of Directors of the Company wish to be clear and transparent with prospective and actual
investors in the Company on the Company’s position in this regard.
The Company is neither authorised nor regulated by the FCA. And cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin) are unregulated in the UK. As with most other
investments, the value of Bitcoin can go down as well as up, and therefore the value of the Company’s Bitcoin holdings can fluctuate. The Company
may not be able to realise its Bitcoin exposure for the same as it paid in the first place or even for the value the Company ascribes to its Bitcoin
positions due to these market movements. And because Bitcoin is unregulated, the Company is not protected by the UK’s Financial Ombudsman Service
or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
Nevertheless, the Board of Directors of the Company has taken the decision to invest in Bitcoin, and in doing so is mindful of the special risks Bitcoin
presents to the Company’s financial position. These risks include (but are not limited to): (i) the value of Bitcoin can be highly volatile, with value
dropping as quickly as it can rise. Investors in Bitcoin must be prepared to lose all money invested in Bitcoin; (ii) the Bitcoin market is largely
unregulated. There is a risk of losing money due to risks such as cyber-attacks, financial crime and counterparty failure; (iii) the Company may not be
able to sell its Bitcoin at will. The ability to sell Bitcoin depends on various factors, including the supply and demand in the market at the relevant time.
Operational failings such as technology outages, cyber-attacks and comingling of funds could cause unwanted delay; and (iv) cryptoassets are
characterised in some quarters by high degrees of fraud, money laundering and financial crime. In addition, there is a perception in some quarters that
cyber-attacks are prominent which can lead to theft of holdings or ransom demands. The Board of Directors of the Company does not subscribe to such
a negative view, especially in relation to Bitcoin. However, prospective investors in the Company are encouraged to do your own research before
investing.
Note that the data presented in this document for the Company and its peers is accurate as of 5 January 2026, unless otherwise noted.

Bitcoin Treasury
c
Bitcoin is our preferred treasury asset

High mNAV enables accretive issuance
Illustrative Example

• Bitcoin is unique as a store-of-value asset with an immutably finite
supply (there will only ever be 21M)
• Bitcoin’s design of increasing scarcity of new supply issuance may
cause it to appreciate in value over time
• Bitcoin is digital capital, with qualities we prefer vs. gold or fiat

Accumulation via capital market tools
• As a public company, SWC can utilise capital markets to raise capital &
strengthen its balance sheet by accumulating Bitcoin

Bitcoin Treasury: Market Reaction Is Not Unexpected
c
Bitcoin treasury strategy history & maths
•

Proven treasury strategy:
○

In 2020 Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, adopted Bitcoin
as its primary treasury asset in the US

○

Since then, other companies have followed including Metaplanet
(Japan) and Capital B (France)

○

Today +100 public companies hold Bitcoin as a treasury asset

○

•

Internationally repeated success

When professionally executed, this strategy has delivered
exceptional results in major capital markets around the world

Performance from simple maths:
○

Bitcoin treasury companies utilise capital markets to accumulate
Bitcoin

○

The expectation of future Bitcoin accumulation may cause these
companies to trade at a premium to the value of their existing
Bitcoin stockpile

○

When at a premium, new share issuance to buy Bitcoin allows the
company to increase its Bitcoin per share

○

In turn, the expectation of more “accretive equity issuance” may
cause the market premium to increase, inviting further share issuance
