fraudulent misstatement.

Important Information: Bitcoin Treasury
The Smarter Web Company Plc (the Company) holds treasury reserves and surplus cash in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency or cryptoasset.
Whilst the Board of Directors of the Company considers holding Bitcoin to be in the best interests of the Company, the Board remains aware that the
financial regulator in the UK (the Financial Conduct Authority or FCA) considers investment in Bitcoin to be high risk. At the outset, it is important to
note that an investment in the Company is not an investment in Bitcoin, either directly or by proxy. However, the Board of Directors of the Company
consider Bitcoin to be an appropriate store of value and growth for the Company's reserves and, accordingly, the Company is materially exposed to
Bitcoin. Such an approach is innovative, and the Board of Directors of the Company wish to be clear and transparent with prospective and actual
investors in the Company on the Company's position in this regard.
The Company is neither authorised nor regulated by the FCA. And cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin) are unregulated in the UK. As with most other
investments, the value of Bitcoin can go down as well as up, and therefore the value of the Company's Bitcoin holdings can fluctuate. The Company
may not be able to realise its Bitcoin exposure for the same as it paid in the first place or even for the value the Company ascribes to its Bitcoin
positions due to these market movements. And because Bitcoin is unregulated, the Company is not protected by the UK's Financial Ombudsman Service
or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
Nevertheless, the Board of Directors of the Company has taken the decision to invest in Bitcoin, and in doing so is mindful of the special risks Bitcoin
presents to the Company's financial position. These risks include (but are not limited to): (i) the value of Bitcoin can be highly volatile, with value
dropping as quickly as it can rise. Investors in Bitcoin must be prepared to lose all money invested in Bitcoin; (ii) the Bitcoin market is largely
unregulated. There is a risk of losing money due to risks such as cyber-attacks, financial crime and counterparty failure; (iii) the Company may not be
able to sell its Bitcoin at will. The ability to sell Bitcoin depends on various factors, including the supply and demand in the market at the relevant time.
Operational failings such as technology outages, cyber-attacks and comingling of funds could cause unwanted delay; and (iv) cryptoassets are
characterised in some quarters by high degrees of fraud, money laundering and financial crime. In addition, there is a perception in some quarters that
cyber-attacks are prominent which can lead to theft of holdings or ransom demands. The Board of Directors of the Company does not subscribe to such
a negative view, especially in relation to Bitcoin. However, prospective investors in the Company are encouraged to do your own research before
investing.
Note that the data presented in this document for the Company and its peers is accurate as of 21 January 2026, unless otherwise noted.

Long-Term Future Acquisition Strategy
b

Consideration | Smarter Web acquisition strategy

Target characteristics | The acquisition strategy is focused on targeting operating cash flows with a 3 to 4 years payback
Strategic fit | Identify strategically attractive acquisitions to grow core business and deliver cost efficiencies
Operating synergy | Plan to acquire and manage from a distance initially and then retain separate brands whilst introducing efficiency and increase recurring revenue
Same industry vs. new | Consider diversification to improve operating cash flow and / or reduce sector dependency
Funding | A mix of stock and cash components to complement the Bitcoin treasury strategy
Selectivity | The Smarter Web Company will only make acquisitions where the Directors believe the timing and opportunity is appropriate to deliver our strategic objectives

Smarter Web can selectively utilise balance sheet strength to acquire operating businesses with
attractive economics and strategic value, boosting annual operating income

Please see the important information slides in this presentation.

Acquisition Strategy: Utilising The Balance Sheet
b

Market cap (£M, Illustrative)
Assumes acquisition cost 3.5x operating profits
Pre-acq.: 500 | Acq.: 8 | Post-acq.: 508
% increase: 1.5%

Operating profits (£M, Illustrative)
Pre-acq.: 2.3 | Acq.: 0.04 | Post-acq.: 2.34
% increase: +5,850%

Acquisition payback timeline (illustrative)
£M | Payback in Y4
Y0: Acquisition cost 8, Operating profits 2.3
Y1-Y6: Operating profits accumulate
Total: 13.8

Deal structure (illustrative)
• 30% stock upfront; 70% paid over 3 years ("earn out")
• Earn out ensures operating team remains in place & motivated
• Operating profits from acquired business should largely cover
the earn out acquisition payments Y1-Y3
• If operating profits dip post-acq, provisions can be in place to
reduce earn out payments
• Strength of Bitcoin balance sheet provides backup payment
methods of stock issuance

Note: This is an illustrative and simplified acquisition structure shown at a higher market cap than the current market value of the business, to
highlight how acquisitions in the future could improve the operating profits of the Group, with minimal dilution or cost to shareholders.

Smarter Web is a Bitcoin treasury company
3
Bitcoin is our preferred treasury asset

• We believe that Bitcoin is the best asset the world has ever seen
• Bitcoin is unique as a store-of-value asset with an immutably finite
supply (there will only ever be 21M)
• Bitcoin's design of increasing scarcity of new supply issuance may
cause it to appreciate in value over time
• Bitcoin is digital capital, with qualities we prefer vs. gold or fiat

Bitcoin per share is our KPI
Sats per share (BTC x 100m)

Compounding Bitcoin via capital market tools
• As a public company, SWC can utilise capital markets to raise capital &
strengthen its balance sheet by accumulating Bitcoin
• Depending on market conditions, different capital market tools may
make sense
• SWC's goal is to increase our Bitcoin holdings per share
• For shareholders, successful execution of our treasury strategy means
compounding Bitcoin ownership

Please see the important information slides in this presentation.

Bitcoin treasury: global precedence of success
a
Bitcoin treasury strategy history & maths
•
Proven treasury strategy:
○ In 2020 Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, adopted Bitcoin
as its primary treasury asset in the US
○ Since then, other companies have followed including Metaplanet
(Japan) and Capital B (France)
○ Today +100 public companies hold Bitcoin as a treasury asset
○ When professionally executed, this strategy has delivered
exceptional results in major capital markets around the world

• Performance from simple maths:
○ Bitcoin treasury companies utilise capital markets to accumulate
Bitcoin
○ The expectation of future Bitcoin accumulation may cause these
companies to trade at a premium to the value of their existing
Bitcoin stockpile
○ When at a premium, new share issuance to buy Bitcoin allows the
company to increase its Bitcoin per share
○ In turn, the expectation of more "accretive equity issuance" may
cause the market premium to increase, inviting further share issuance

Internationally repeated success

Strategy | Metaplanet | Capital B | The Smarter Web Co.

Strategy start: August 2020 | April 2024 | Nov 2024 | April 2025

Performance since start: +814% | +1,590% | +479% | +1,260%

Performance last 12 months: -61% | -42% | -2% | +1,260%

Market cap ($M): 42,740 | 2,523 | 157 | 184

Note: Data as of 17 February 2026, SWC numbers use fully diluted share count

Opportunity for early-stage exposure to demonstrated thesis
a

Maturity stage of leading Bitcoin treasuries
• Less potential upside for Bitcoin per share with Strategy (US leader, hold
~700k BTC) and Metaplanet (Japan leader, hold ~35k BTC)
• Smarter Web has considerable room for upside growth in Bitcoin per
share (UK leader, hold ~2.7k BTC)
• Staggered inception of Bitcoin treasury strategy in capital markets
creates opportunity to identify next global winner

UK environment ideal for repeat of success
• UK has structural barriers to direct Bitcoin ownership (banking on/off
ramps, restrictive mandates, etc.), making Bitcoin treasury companies
attractive alternative
• Awareness of Bitcoin and Bitcoin treasury model still low but growing,
both at retail and institutional levels
• Bitcoin treasury strategy offers potential to "catch-up" on missed upside
from late entry to Bitcoin exposure
• Long-term thematic flows: A portion of the £1.5-2T in ISAs and SIPPs
could seek Bitcoin exposure over time

Scale
Strategy (USA): ~5.5 years since start, ~700,000 BTC
Metaplanet (Japan): ~2 years since start, ~35,000 BTC
Smarter Web (UK): ~9 months since start, 2,689 BTC

What justifies mNAV premium?

Valuation components of treasury co. (Illustrative example)
£M: NAV + Anticipated lifetime BTC Yield + BTCTC admin drag + Operating biz value = Market cap

Anticipated BTC Yield creates mNAV premium
• A Bitcoin treasury company is constantly looking for
opportunities to increase its Bitcoin holdings per share
• A treasury co. can generate BTC Yield through certain
transactions at any mNAV (above, at, or below 1x mNAV)
• In any given year, a Bitcoin treasury company is likely to
execute transactions that increase Bitcoin per share (e.g.,
annual BTC Yield of ~10%)
• An asset that grows Bitcoin ownership every year is worth
paying a premium for in Bitcoin terms
• This results in the average mNAV for a well-run Bitcoin
treasury company being above 1x, though it will be volatile
and may sometimes be below 1x
• Overall, the premium reflects investors' confidence in the
model of a Bitcoin treasury company to utilise capital market
tools to increase Bitcoin per share over time

Please see the important information slides in this presentation.

Smarter Convert - BTC-denominated convertible notes
b

Smarter Convert benefits for SWC
• Productises SWC's high volatility (~120%) via option value
○ Investors receive ~80% of option value
○ SWC retains ~20% of option value, in the form of the
conversion premium
• Adds Bitcoin to SWC treasury, assuming conversion
• Delivers BTC Yield to shareholders, assuming conversion

Smarter Convert benefits for investors
• High vol equity upside: right to convert into SWC shares
at 50% premium if the ~120% volatility equity performs
• Bitcoin protection: if equity doesn't perform (or
underperforms BTC), investor gets 98% of BTC back

For Bitcoin holders who want to outperform Bitcoin
without risk of underperforming Bitcoin

Smarter Convert enables accretive equity issuance when at (or below) 1x mNAV (Illustrative example)
£M: Before: Market cap 100, NAV 100
Debt issued, BTC received; offsetting: +10, -10
Debt converted to equity at 50% premium
After: Market cap 110, NAV 110

mNAV: 1x -> 1x
Shares: 300 -> 320
Dilution: 6.7% (50% conversion premium)
NAV growth: 10%
Bitcoin per share: +3.1%

UK equities lack volatility - Smarter Web introduces it

UK equity markets starved for volatility

• UK equity markets are structural low-volatility
○ FTSE indices among the lowest vol markets globally due to
defensive sector mix
• Low vol inhibits active manager outperformance
○ Limited dispersion creates fewer opportunities for alpha
• High volatility creates return opportunities
○ Bitcoin-level volatility enables small allocations to shift
portfolio returns
