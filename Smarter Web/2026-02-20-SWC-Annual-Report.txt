Building better
websites. Powered
by digital capital.
Founded in 2009, The Smarter Web Company PLC is a UK-based web design
& online marketing business powered by digital capital. We create beautiful
websites that help brands grow and we manage a Bitcoin treasury that builds
long-term value. Through its operating subsidiary, Smarter Web Operations,
the Company delivers bespoke, mobile-friendly websites and a focused range
of digital services to small and medium-sized businesses, start-ups, and ownermanaged firms. The business has built a loyal, diversified client base by offering
high-quality digital solutions without the cost structure of large agencies.
Since 2022, The Smarter Web Company has extended this digital-first
philosophy to its balance sheet by accepting Bitcoin as payment and in 2025 we
adopted a formal Bitcoin Treasury Policy, the majority of treasury assets are held
in Bitcoin, reflecting the Board’s belief in its long-term value as a scarce, resilient
asset aligned with the future of digital services and capital management.
As of 31 October 2025, the Company has accumulated 2,660 Bitcoin, making
it the largest corporate Bitcoin treasury in the UK by a large margin, and one of
the largest globally.

Our Story

2009
Founded as a web design
& online marketing
business
In the same year that Bitcoin’s
creator, Satoshi Nakamoto,
mined the first block of the
Bitcoin blockchain, known as
the Genesis Block.

2017
Our founder, Andrew
Webley, first discovered
Bitcoin
Viewing it initially as a
volatile emerging asset and
with the potential of a medium
of exchange.


2010

2015

The Apple iPad was first
launched

Responsive web design
becomes standard

The launch of the iPad in
2010 marked a turning point
in digital design, pushing
websites to adapt seamlessly
to both touch and smaller
screen sizes. Within just a
few years, responsive layouts
became the new normal
across the web design
industry, reshaping how users
expected to browse and
interact online.

In 2015, the CMS was
relaunched, giving SWC
the capability to deliver fully
responsive web design.
This update positioned
the platform in line with
modern standards, at a time
when responsive websites
were rapidly becoming the
industry default.

2019

2020

Proving a model long
before everyone else

MicroStrategy pivoted
to Bitcoin

In 2019, as Covid emerged
and businesses across the
world rapidly shifted to remote
working, many were forced
to adapt to a new way of
operating. SWC, however,
was already a decade ahead
– having worked remotely
with clients for ten years and
proving the model long before
it became mainstream.

A defining moment that
inspired Andrew’s vision.
Watching Michael Saylor
successfully merge a publicly
listed company with Bitcoin as
a treasury asset revealed what
was possible when corporate
finance met digital capital.
This was Andrew’s “Bitcoin
moment,” sparking the
strategic thinking that would
later shape The Smarter Web
Company PLC’s own Bitcoin
treasury approach.

Strategic report

2022
Our founder began
searching for a UK-listed
company with a Bitcoin
treasury strategy
One that placed shareholders
at the centre while actively
using capital market tools
to grow Bitcoin per share as
it progressed an operating
business strategy. In 2022,
The Smarter Web Company
also began accepting payment
for its services in Bitcoin.

2024
A decision was made
After several years of
searching for a UK company
with a true Bitcoin treasury
strategy, Andrew realised the
only way forward was to take
his own business public.


2025
The Smarter Web
Company PLC listed on
the Aquis Exchange
Within two months, grew from
a 2.5p listing price to exceed a
£1 billion market capitalisation
(as at 21 June 2025) – making
it one of the most successful
IPOs in UK history. In its
first six months as a public
company, SWC raised over
£225 million, establishing a
strong foundation based on
digital capital.

2026
Admission To The London Stock
Exchange’s Main Market
On 03 February 2026 The Smarter Web
Company PLC began trading on the London
Stock Exchange’s Main Market for listed
securities, one of the world’s most historic and
important stock exchanges.


Chair’s statement
Sean Wade
Non-Executive
Chairman

2025 has been
a landmark year
for The Smarter
Web Company
Dear Shareholders,

Financial results

I am delighted to present the inaugural Full Year
Results for The Smarter Web Company PLC for
the financial year ended 31 October 2025; and
to report on the successful implementation,
during the year, of the Group’s strategy and the
progress of our 10 year plan.

The focus of the Board during the financial year has been on
the sustainable growth of the Company’s balance sheet through
expansion of the Bitcoin treasury to build a balance sheet
founded on what the Board believe to the be the best digital
capital. The Board believe this will give the Company a solid
foundation for the business to deliver on its 10 year plan.

Overview
2025 was a foundational year for the Group, starting with
our listing in April 2025 on the AQSE Growth Market, the
exponential growth of our balance sheet under our Bitcoin
Treasury Policy and our 10 year plan, to the build up of our
Board with recruitment of experienced and diverse talent. All of
which laid the foundation for our listing on the Main Market of
the London Stock Exchange on 3 February 2026 giving access
to one of the premier global capital markets and growing our
shareholder base.
On behalf of the entire Board of Directors I would like to extend
my gratitude to our dedicated team for the achievements during
this financial year and beyond and to our Shareholders for their
continued support.


The Group achieved a profit before tax of £2,835,848 for the
year, however if one off gains and fair value adjustment credit of
£4,308,224 were excluded, the result would have been a loss
before tax of £1,472,376. During the year the Company raised
in excess of £209 million in capital and a further £16 million
through convertible loans and acquired 2,660 Bitcoin in
treasury, both a significant achievement from a standing start.

Strategic report


Chair’s statement continued

Corporate Strategy and Operating
Business
The Group’s operating business delivers quality and affordable
web design services to small and medium-sized enterprises
across the UK. Performance during the year was in line with the
Board’s expectations, and the Board remains confident in the
long-term potential of the business.
A key component of the Group’s strategy is to grow the web
design business through selective and disciplined acquisitions.
The Board believes acquisition-led growth will strengthen the
Group’s capabilities, enhance scale, and support progress
towards sustainable profitability. All opportunities will be
assessed against clear Board-set criteria to ensure alignment
with long-term shareholder interests.

Dividend Policy
The Company does not intend to pay dividends in the
foreseeable future. Surplus capital is expected to be reinvested
into the operating business, deployed in pursuit of value
accretive acquisitions, or retained in accordance with the
Group’s Bitcoin treasury policy. The Board will continue to
review the dividend policy periodically, balancing reinvestment
requirements with long-term shareholder value creation.

Outlook

Bitcoin Treasury Strategy

2025 has been a landmark year for The Smarter Web Company,
and the Board is confident the Group is well positioned to build
on this progress as Andrew and the executive team continue
to execute the 10 year plan. With a stable operating platform, a
clear acquisition framework, and a differentiated balance sheet,
the Company enters the year ahead with confidence.

Alongside its organic growth and acquisition strategy, the
Group has continued to build its balance sheet by allocating a
significant portion of its corporate treasury to Bitcoin. During
the financial year we accumulated 2,660 Bitcoin via various
activities in capital markets.

It only remains for me to thank Andrew and the executive
team for their leadership and commitment, all employees for
their contribution during this important year, and our advisers
and shareholders for their continued support as the Company
continues to execute its 10 year plan.

The Board believes Bitcoin represents a compelling long-term
store of value, an increasingly relevant form of digital capital, and
a hedge against fiat currency inflation, with the Bitcoin Treasury
Policy supporting investment and growth across the Group.

Corporate Governance
The Board is responsible for leading and controlling the Group
and has overall authority for the management and conduct
of the Group’s business, its strategy and development. It is
committed to the highest standards of corporate governance for
a Main Market-listed company.

Sean Wade
Non-Executive Chairman
19 February 2026

The Company will report to its Shareholders, on an ongoing
basis, on its compliance with the UK Corporate Governance
Code in accordance with the UK Listing Rules.
As envisaged by the UK Corporate Governance Code, the
Board has established three committees: an Audit and Risk
Committee, a Remuneration Committee and a Nomination
Committee. The Board has also established a Disclosure
Committee. If the need should arise, the Board may establish
additional committees as appropriate.

Bitcoin Treasury Strategy
Alongside our operating strategy, the Group’s Bitcoin balance
sheet has never been stronger. During the year, we continued to
execute on our treasury strategy and are proud to be the largest
Bitcoin treasury company in the UK.

The Group’s operating business has continued to perform in line
with our expectations during the year. Our underlying operations
are stable, and we remain confident in the long-term potential
of the operating business.

At the year end, the Company held 2,660 Bitcoin, with a market
value of approximately £220 million. This position provides the
Group with a robust and differentiated balance sheet, which we
believe strengthens our long-term financial resilience.

We firmly believe that acquisitions are a key driver in advancing
our operating business. Our acquisition strategy is focused on
selectively acquiring high-quality, cash-generative businesses
with recurring revenue that strengthen our core capabilities and
accelerate our return to sustainable profitability. This approach
is consistent with our long-term ambition to build a large,
profitable operating business.

Whilst we acknowledge that Bitcoin is a volatile asset, our
conviction remains unwavering. We believe Bitcoin represents
the best asset the world has ever seen, combining scarcity,
security, and global liquidity in a way unmatched by any
alternative store of value. Our belief in Bitcoin as a long-term
strategic asset is undoubted, and we remain committed to this
approach.

We have explored several opportunities and believe that by
using our balance sheet, and cash flows from any acquisitions,
we can progress this strategy in an exciting way. We remain
disciplined in our capital allocation and are committed to
ensuring that any acquisition activity enhances shareholder
value and contributes meaningfully over the medium term.

Over the coming months we aim to increase our treasury and
are excited by the opportunities presented by this.

Chief Executive’s Statement continued

People, Governance and Community
During the year, we have grown the team and expanded the
Board, ensuring that the Company has the depth of talent,
experience, and governance required to deliver on its strategy. I
would like to thank all our employees, directors, and advisers for
their hard work, commitment, and professionalism throughout
the year.
We are also fortunate to have one of the most engaged
shareholder bases in the market. With the third-largest retail
investor community within the Bitcoin treasury space, we are
extremely grateful for the continued support and belief shown
by our shareholders. This support does not go unnoticed,
and we remain focused on delivering long-term value for all
stakeholders.

London Stock Exchange Listing
In April 2025, the Company successfully listed its shares on
the Aquis Stock Exchange, providing an efficient and flexible
platform to access public capital at an early stage of our growth
as a listed business. This initial listing enabled us to establish a
public market presence, broaden our shareholder base, and
build the governance, reporting and operational disciplines
required of a publicly traded company.

In February 2026, reflecting the scale of the business achieved
and our long-term growth ambitions, the Company transferred
its listing to the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange.
The London Stock Exchange is one of the world’s leading capital
markets and provides a highly credible platform for companies
of our size and aspirations. A Main Market listing enhances the
Company’s profile with institutional investors, improves share
liquidity, and provides access to a deeper and more diverse pool
of long-term capital. It also positions the Company alongside
established UK and international businesses, reinforcing
our commitment to the highest standards of governance,
transparency and regulatory compliance.
We believe the London Stock Exchange is the appropriate
venue to support the next phase of our development, enabling
us to pursue strategic growth opportunities, attract and retain
high-quality talent, and deliver sustainable long-term value for
shareholders.

Outlook
Looking ahead, we will maintain laser focus on executing our
strategy, strengthening our operating business, advancing
our acquisition pipeline, and continuing to manage our
Bitcoin treasury responsibly. We enter 2026 and beyond with
confidence, ambition, and a clear plan to advance the Company
and create enduring shareholder value.

10 Year Plan
The Smarter Web Company has established a
clear 10-year strategic ambition to become one
of the largest publicly listed companies in the UK,
underpinned by disciplined growth, balance sheet
strength, and long-term shareholder value creation.
The strategy is structured around three complementary pillars:
A 	Organic growth of the Group’s profitable web design and

digital services business

In the near term, the Group is focused on scaling its operating
business to become sustainably cash generative while
continuing to develop its Bitcoin treasury strategy. Over
the medium to long term, the Company intends to pursue
strategically attractive acquisitions, supported by operating cash
flows and capital markets tools, while steadily increasing Bitcoin
holdings per share. Together, these initiatives are intended to
support progression through major UK equity indices, broaden
the Company’s global investor base, and establish a robust
platform for sustainable growth over the coming decade.

Operating model
Lean and scalable

Low gearing levels
A remarkable amount has been achieved over
the past year and we are excited about the
opportunities we see ahead for the business
as we focus on building an efficient operating
model that is built to scale and support the
Company’s strategic 10-year plan to deliver
shareholder value.
Our Bitcoin Treasury strategy is enabling us to build a strong
balance sheet founded upon Bitcoin with minimal gearing
and without exposure to fiat debt. This creates a sustainable
and robust foundation allowing the Company to capitalise on
opportunities as they present themselves. Our commitment
to retaining sufficient working capital to fund operating costs
provides us stability to weather the volatility in the financial
markets.
Our focus is on establishing an efficient operating model
that can scale and support the business as it delivers on its
strategy and growth ambitions. We have achieved this through
being laser focused on costs and applying stringent return on
investment criteria in our capital allocation decision making.
During the year, the business transitioned from a start-up to
a Main Market listed entity, with the associated costs of the
listing process as well as investment in building out enduring
governance frameworks with the addition of key hires including
expansion of our Board.

Costs associated with the listing process are one-off due to the
nature of the project and totalled £1.35 million of which £660k
was recognised in 2025 and the balance will be reflected in the
following financial year.
Our web design business performed in line with expectations in
what has been a transformational year for the Group, delivering
strong gross margins of over 87% albeit on low levels of
revenue. Despite the low revenue outturn for the year, the high
margin profile of the web design business gives us reason for
optimism and supports our strategic ambitions to invest in its
growth through organic and inorganic avenues.
At the end of the financial year the Group had acquired a total
of 2,660 Bitcoin, a significant achievement from a standing
start. The rate of acquisition slowed following the conclusion
of the 2025 financial year due to wider market conditions
however we are optimistic that the rate of Bitcoin acquisition will
reaccelerate in the coming months.
Operationally, the Group has designed an efficient and scalable
operating model that will deliver for shareholders for the long
term.
Albert Soleiman
CFO
19 February 2026


Bitcoin as Digital Capital
We believe that Bitcoin is
the best asset the world
has ever seen:

•	A finite supply: Only 21 million Bitcoin will ever exist, making
it uniquely scarce as a store of value.
•	Engineered for long-term appreciation: Its programmed,
diminishing issuance creates increasing scarcity over time.
• Decentralised and censorship-resistant: No government,
company or individual can control the Bitcoin network.
• Superior to traditional assets: As digital, transferable, and
verifiable capital, Bitcoin offers advantages over both gold
and fiat currency.
As such, our approach to digital assets is firmly “Bitcoin only.”
Bitcoin provides a transparent, liquid and scarce reserve asset,
with no single government, company or individual able to control
its supply. Because of its attractive properties, Bitcoin has been
the best performing major asset in the world over its lifetime.

Building a Balance Sheet
on Digital Capital
The Smarter Web Company is a UK-based web design
agency, founded in 2009 by Andrew Webley, specialising
in creating bespoke, mobile-friendly websites for small and
medium-sized businesses. For 15 years, SWC operated as
a profitable small business based in Bristol. The Smarter
Web Company began accepting Bitcoin as a form of
payment in 2022.
When Michael Saylor turned his US public company,
MicroStrategy, into a “Bitcoin treasury company,” Andrew
believed this was a brilliant model to strengthen a business by
building a balance sheet of Digital Capital. Eventually, Andrew
decided to deploy a similar treasury strategy for The Smarter
Web Company, by taking the 15-year old company public.
In April 2025, The Smarter Web Company IPO’ed on the Aquis
exchange as the first Bitcoin treasury company in the UK.
Utilising capital market tools available to public companies, the
Company began to build its Bitcoin treasury.
The market responded positively to this vision and execution.
The Smarter Web Company was the UK’s best performing
public equity in 2025* and in February 2026 uplisted to
The London Stock Exchange.
Today, The Smarter Web Company has the largest Bitcoin
Treasury amongst UK public companies and amongst the
largest globally. The company aspires to continue building its
balance sheet to eventually join the FTSE 250 and then the
FTSE 100.
As it strives for these goals, The Smarter Web Company will
continue to focus on its thesis that Bitcoin is the best balance
sheet asset for a company to capitalise itself on, and that
accumulating a robust treasury of Digital Capital is a key enabler
of operating success and delivering shareholder value.

Strategy and Objectives
The Smarter Web Company follows a simple strategy
designed for value creation over the long term. We are
thinking in decades, and we believe that there is a huge
opportunity to scale the business over the next 10 years
and beyond.
While we do not have definite Bitcoin accumulation targets,
we believe we can accumulate a much larger balance sheet of
Digital Capital as the leading Bitcoin-powered public company
in the UK. This will be instrumental in helping us to achieve
our objective of eventually becoming one of the largest public
companies in the UK.

Our strategy involves the interwoven elements of our web design
operating business, selective acquisitions to scale the business,
and the supercharging of our balance sheet via the remarkable
properties of Bitcoin as Digital Capital.
Since the process of going public in early 2025, we have
articulated this strategy as our 10-Year Plan, consisting of these
core pillars.

Principal risks
and uncertainties
Risk

Explanation

Mitigation and controls

Valuation risk

Bitcoin prices have historically been volatile and remain
subject to elevated volatility which can directly impact the
balance sheet and overall net asset values. Prices are also
quoted in USD which creates valuation risk in terms of
pricing and foreign currency valuations.

Bitcoin prices and their impact on the Company’s valuation
are tracked in real time and published on its website for full
transparency.

Bitcoin is held with third party custodians and is not self
custodied by the Company leaving it exposed to the
custodian’s solvency and security protocols.

The Company seeks to diversify its Bitcoin holding across
multiple top tier custodians offering institutional grade custody
solutions. Each custodian is selected based on strict internal
criteria and once onboarded is regularly monitored to ensure
continued adherence to these standards.

Counterparty risk

Fair value assessments are carried out on a bi-annual basis
with the results communicated to shareholders and disclosed
in the financial statements.

Custodians selected by the Group to hold Bitcoin each
provide segregated custody wallets to ensure the Group’s
Bitcoin is not co-mingled with assets of the custodian.
All custodians provide the Company with SOC reports which
are included as part of the Company’s ongoing monitoring of
its custodians.
Liquidity risk

The Company’s active web design business does not
generate sufficient cashflow to cover the operating costs
of the business in particular the increased cost base
associated with being a listed business. This exposes the
business to liquidity risk during times where it is unable to
raise funds from the capital markets.

The Company has committed to retaining a minimum of
12 months working capital liquidity to meet its financial
obligations and fund its operating costs. Several potential
working capital scenarios are considered to allow
management adequate planning time for remedial action in a
liquidity stress should they arise.

Banking risk

Banks may not be willing to provide bank accounts or
banking related services to the Company due to its large
holding of Bitcoin. Whilst the Company holds Bitcoin as
a treasury asset and is not involved in activities that would
require it be regulated, banks may be unwilling to provide
it services as it is not regulated by a recognised regulator.

The Company is regularly reviewing its banking relationships
and seeking to diversify those relationships while remaining
disciplined in selecting reliable and secure banking partners.

Competition risk

Web design is an intensely competitive market dominated
by larger players and increasingly new entrants leveraging
of artificial intelligence tools. This risks the web design
business failing to realise its growth plans and achieving
acceptable returns on investments made.

Management is confident in its strategy of targeting small to
medium enterprises and offering them a quality service at
competitive pricing as well as establishing lasting relationships
through personalised service offerings. Inorganic growth
opportunities are assessed against strict internal hurdles for
returns on investment to ensure growth by acquisition is value
accretive for the Group.


Strategic report


Section 172 Statement
Relationship with
Shareholders

Interests of Employees

The Company understands its
responsibilities towards all of our
shareholders and the Board continues
to take account of the interests of these
shareholders when taking key decisions.

Our people are central to our success
and delivering on our 10 year plan. The
Board engages with employees through:

The Directors are mindful of their duty
under Section 172 of the Companies
Act 2006 (“Section 172”) to act in a way
which they consider, in good faith, is
most likely to promote the success of the
Company for the benefit of its members as
a whole. In doing so, the Board consider
the matters set out in Section 172.

•	Share Participation: Maintaining
a Share Dealing Code and seeking
shareholder approval for an employee
equity plan to align employee interests
with long-term shareholder value.

•	Open Communication: Regular
dialogues and feedback loops to
ensure a transparent environment.

Fostering Business
Relationships
•	Customers: We aim to provide
access to high quality web services at
affordable prices to give customers in
the small to medium enterprise sector
the ability to build an online presence
and empowering them to grow their
business.
• Suppliers: We prioritise ethical
sourcing and professional integrity. We
appointed Coinbase Institutional as an
additional Bitcoin custody partner to
mitigate counterparty risk and enhance
transparency.

Long-Term Consequences
of Decisions

Maintaining High Standards
of Business Conduct

Acting Fairly with our
Shareholders

The Board’s primary focus in 2025 was
the successful transition to a public
company via its listing on the Aquis Stock
Exchange in April 2025 which provided
the foundation for implementing our
“The 10 Year Plan”, which includes as its
cornerstone the Bitcoin treasury policy.

Following the IPO on AQSE, the Board
has reinforced its governance structures
to ensure they remain “fit for purpose”.
As an AQSE listed business we adhered
to the QCA Corporate Governance
Code to maintain a reputation for integrity
and transparency in the public markets.
The move to the Main Market will require
adherence to the stringent rules of the UK
Financial Conduct Authority’s Official List.

The Board ensures all members are
treated fairly. This is achieved through
transparent reporting and maintaining
an open dialogue with investors via the
Company’s investor relations website.

The Board remains committed to its
core web services business, focused
on increasing our portfolio of over 250
active client websites through targeted
marketing (organic growth) and actively
progressing an acquisition strategy
targeting other web agencies to grow
client numbers and recurring revenue.
A key development in January 2026
was the announcement of the intention
to cancel the AQSE listing and seek
admission to the LSE’s Main Market on
or around 3 February 2026. This move
is intended to increase market visibility,
broaden the institutional investor base,
and improve share liquidity, securing the
Company’s future growth potential.


Impact on Community and
Environment
The Company is committed to digital
inclusion and high ethical standards,
providing access to digital assets to its
shareholders, supporting local businesses
through its web design business and
operating efficiently as a digital-first business.

During 2025, the Company successfully
raised over £209.4 million in equity
capital across multiple placings with no
long-term debt. This was primarily to fund
our “The 10 Year Plan” and acquire a
significant treasury position in Bitcoin.
The Board acknowledges that the FCA
considers investment in Bitcoin high risk
and that the value of holdings can fluctuate
significantly. As of October 2025, the
Company held approximately 2,660 Bitcoin
as part of its treasury policy, acquired at
an average price of roughly £82,800 per
Bitcoin. The Board remains transparent about
these risks and the Company’s material
exposure to Bitcoin, which is intended to be
accretive to shareholders.

Strategic report


Chairman’s governance
overview
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Group’s
Governance report for the year ended 31 October 2025. As
we celebrate the milestone of admission to the Main Market of
the London Stock Exchange on 3 February 2026, and all that
has been achieved by the Group in the past year, the Board
remains focused on supporting management in delivering on
the Group’s strategy and delivering value for our shareholders
and stakeholders.
The Board recognises that effective governance is key to the
Group’s sustained success and our governance framework
enables decisions to be made in line with the business
objectives and that appropriate oversight and challenge is
provided. My role as Chairman is to ensure the Board operates
with the transparency and discipline required of a listed entity,
while fostering a culture that supports delivery of high-quality
web design services alongside building a strong balance sheet
on the back of our Bitcoin Treasury Policy.

UK Corporate Governance Code
The past year has been transformative for the Group. We have
transitioned from the Aquis Stock Exchange to the Main Market
of the LSE, a move that demands the highest standards of
stewardship. Our governance framework is designed to bridge
the gap between robust corporate oversight whilst supporting
delivery of our strategy.
From 25 April 2025 to 2 February 2026, the Company adopted
the QCA Code of Governance and after the year being
reported, upon joining the Main Market of the London Stock
Exchange (commercial company) on 3 February 2026, the
Company adopted the UK Corporate Governance Code with
some exceptions that we are working to implement, as we strive
to support our ambitious growth plans within the framework of
strong governance that delivers for all our stakeholders.
As envisaged by the UK Corporate Governance Code, the
Board has established three committees: an Audit and Risk
Committee, a Remuneration Committee and a Nomination
Committee. The Board has also established a Disclosure
Committee. If the need should arise, the Board may establish
additional committees as appropriate.
The UK Corporate Governance Code recommends that at least
half the board of directors of a UK listed company (excluding
the Chair) should comprise “independent” non-executive
directors. The majority of the Board will comprise Non-Executive
Directors, with half of the Board, comprising Randal Casson,
Martin Thomas and Sean Wade, regarded by the Company as
independent Non-Executive Directors within the meaning of the

UK Corporate Governance Code and free from any business or
other relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise
of their independent judgement.
Whilst the Company does not currently comply with the
recommendation that more than half of the Board (excluding
the Chair) are independent Non-Executive Directors, the
balance of the Board is deemed to be appropriate to provide
adequate corporate governance at this stage in the Company’s
development. It is, however, noted that the Company intends to
comply with this requirement of the UK Corporate Governance
Code and accordingly will actively seek to appoint a further
independent Non-Executive Director in due course subject to
identifying appropriate candidates.

Board Composition and Diversity
Our Board brings together a wealth of experience. With the
appointment of Randal Casson and Martin Thomas, we have
ensured a strong independent voice with a diverse skill set to
challenge management and protect shareholder interests.
As the Company develops further, the Board will continue
to review its composition to ensure a suitably diverse Board,
one that best serves the interests of both shareholders and
customers.
These appointments and the progress made on our governance
frameworks has led to us implementing Board committees
commensurate with a listed business including audit and risk,
remuneration and nomination committee all of which are
reported upon in the subsequent sections. Other committees
and advisory boards will be kept under review and implemented
as relevant.

Looking Ahead
Governance is not a static exercise. As we scale, the Board
will continue to evolve its oversight of the business, its control
environment and the effectiveness of its risk management
procedures. This will involve, among other things, an annual
Board Effectiveness Review.
We remain committed to open communication with our
shareholders and look forward to engaging with you during our
first year on the Main Market.
Sean Wade
Non-Executive Chairman

Audit & Risk Committee
report
During the year ended 31 October 2025, the initial members
of the Audit Committee were Andrew Webley and Mario
Visconti. The Committee met once to approve the Company’s
unaudited interim results (for six months ending 30 April 2025)
following the Company’s move to the AQSE Growth Market.
On 1 October 2025 Randal Casson joined the Board of the
Company and was additionally appointed as chair of the
Audit Committee. On 8 January 2026 Martin Thomas joined
the Board of the Company and also the Audit Committee. In
preparation for the uplisting to the Main Market, Andrew and
Mario resigned from the Audit Committee, which was also
renamed the Audit and Risk Committee. The Committee has
met once since the end of the year.

Audit and Risk Committee membership
The UK Corporate Governance Code recommends that the
Audit and Risk Committee comprise at least two members
who are both independent Non-Executive Directors (Randal
Casson and Martin Thomas) and includes one member with
recent and relevant financial experience (Randal Casson). The
Chair of the Board should not be a member of the Audit and
Risk Committee. The Company therefore complies with the UK
Corporate Governance Code recommendation with effect from
8 January 2026.
By invitation, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, Chief
Executive Officer, and representatives of the Company’s auditor
also attend Committee meetings. The Committee Chair attends
the Company’s annual general meeting to respond to any
shareholder questions on the Committee’s activities.

Committee responsibilities
The terms of reference of the Audit and Risk Committee
(available on the Company’s website) set out the responsibilities
of the Committee.

External auditor
The Company’s auditor changed to PKF Littlejohn LLP; they
were appointed the Company’s auditor from 21 August 2025
following the resignation of Alder Shine LLP. The Company
received a statement from the departing auditor that indicated
there were no matters Adler Shine LLP considered necessary
to be brought to the attention of the Company’s members
(pursuant to Companies Act 2006 ss. 519(2) and 519(3B)).


Following their appointment as auditor, PKF Littlejohn LLP was
also engaged in the uplisting project as Reporting Accountant
for the Prospectus that supported the Company joining the
Main Market on 3 February 2026. This Prospectus is available
from the Company’s website. The Audit team was separate to
the Reporting Accountant team.
The Audit Committee (now constituted as the Audit and Risk
Committee) assists the Board in discharging its responsibilities
with regard to financial reporting, external and internal audits
and controls, including reviewing the Company’s annual and
half-yearly financial statements, making recommendations on
the appointment, reappointment and removal of the external
auditor, monitoring the independence of the external auditor,
reviewing the objectivity and effectiveness of the audit process
reviewing the scope and fees of the audit and non-audit work
undertaken by the external auditor, and considering the need for
an internal audit function.

Audit services
For the year-ended 31 October 2025, audit fees were £68,500.

Non-audit services
There were no non-audit services during the year to
31 October 2025. Since the year end the auditor performed
the role of Reporting Accountant in the uplisting, for which it
received a fee of £151,500.
The Committee were satisfied that the auditor’s independence
was not compromised by this non-audit service due to the use
of a separate team.

Internal Audit
The Committee considered the need for an internal audit
function and concluded that this is not necessary given the
current size and scope of the Company’s activities.

Strategic report


Nominations Committee
report
During year ended 31 October 2025, the Company did not
establish a Nominations Committee owing to the size of the
business. Matters dealt with by a Nominations Committee, were
managed by the Board. During the year, the Board met to
consider and make the following board appointments:
•	Randal Casson as an independent non-executive director
(appointed: 1 October 2025)
•	Albert Soleiman as Chief Financial Officer (appointed:
1 September 2025)
On 8 January 2026, Martin Thomas was appointed as an
independent non-executive director.
Following the Company’s admission to the Main Market of the
London Stock Exchange on 3 February 2026, the Company has
established a Nominations Committee. The Committee assists the
Board in reviewing the structure, composition and make-up of the
Board and any committees of the Board, succession planning,
evaluating the balance of skills, experience, independence and
knowledge on the Board and leading the process for Board
appointments and making recommendations to the Board on
such matters. It is also responsible for assisting with any evaluation
process to assess the overall and individual performance of the
Board and its committees and reviewing the policies on diversity
and progress on achieving objectives under the policy.

The UK Corporate Governance Code recommends that a
majority of the members of the Nomination Committee should
be independent Non-Executive Directors. As the UK Corporate
Governance Code does not restrict the Chair of the Company from
being a member of the Nomination Committee, the Company’s
three independent Non-Executive Directors (Sean Wade, Randal
Casson and Martin Thomas) will be the initial members of the
Nomination Committee and the Company will comply with the UK
Corporate Governance Code recommendation.
The Nomination Committee is made up of a minimum of three
members. The Nomination Committee is chaired by Sean Wade.
The Nomination Committee will meet at least once per year and
otherwise as the Chair of the committee, or a majority of the
committee members, shall require.
In accordance with Provision 21 of the UK Corporate
Governance Code, the Company will undertake an annual
review of the performance of the Board and Board committees,
the chair and individual directors.
The Board currently does not comply with the recommendation
of the UK Corporate Governance Code (Provision 11) that more
than half of the Board, excluding the Chair, are independent
non-executive directors, the Company intends to appoint
another independent non-executive director. The Committee
will be active in relation to such appointment.

Remuneration Committee
Report
Annual Statement from the Chair of the
Remuneration Committee

The outcomes of the salary reviews and bonus allocation are set
out below in the auditable part of this report.

As the Chair of the Remuneration Committee,
I am pleased to present our Remuneration
Report for the year ended 31 October 2025.

Committee Membership

This report comprises two sections: ﬁrst, this, my annual
statement as Chair of the Remuneration Committee; second, the
proposed Remuneration Policy which will be put for approval by
shareholders at this year’s Annual General Meeting (“AGM”).

• Executive and senior management salaries;

The Committee’s objective is to ensure executive pay is
competitive and directly aligned with the Company’s strategic
“10 Year Plan” rewarding the growth of our web design business
(both organically and through acquisition) and the successful
stewardship of our Bitcoin Treasury strategy whilst ensuring due
consideration is given to all of our key stakeholders.

The Committee consists of independent Non-Executive
Directors who meet during the year to review:

• The proposed employee equity plan;
•	The implementation of the Share Dealing Code for Directors
and PDMRs; and
•	Incentive structures linked to the upcoming Main Market
listing in February 2026.

year, the Company achieved a number of significant milestones
including the IPO on AQSE in April 2025, over £209.4 million of

on 3 February 2026. The web design business continues to perform
in line with expectations during a period of significant change
for the Group, and while no acquisitions have been completed
in the period, the Board continues to review strategic acquisition
opportunities.
The Company operates in a transparent manner with its
shareholders openly sharing its strategy and progress on a
regular basis.
During the year, the Committee discussed the bonus allocation
and salary reviews for all the employees of the Company
including Directors and discussed the operation of and

Strategic report


Remuneration Committee Report continued

The details of the proposed equity scheme are provided below.

Shareholding guidelines
Executive Directors are required to build up a holding of 300%
of base annual salary. Executive Directors will be required to build
up to this level over a period of ﬁve years, starting from the date
of our Main Market listing in February 2026 for the Executive
Directors who were in their role at that time and from the date of
appointment for any recruits in future. Executive Directors will be
required to retain at least 50% of shares vesting (net of tax) until
the guideline level is achieved. For the purposes of satisfying the
shareholding requirement, shares held by a connected person
(e.g. a spouse) will be considered to be included.

Clawback and malus provisions
Awards under the LTIP will be subject to provisions that allow
the Committee to withhold, reduce or require the repayment of
awards after vesting if there is found to have been: (a) material
misstatement of the Company’s ﬁnancial results; (b) gross
misconduct on the part of the award holder; or (c) any other
material event as the Committee considers appropriate.

Service contracts
The Executive Directors are employed under contracts of
employment with The Smarter Web Company PLC. The principal
terms of the Executive Directors’ service contracts are as follows:

Sean Wade
Randal Casson
Tyler Evans

Contract date

•	The number of shares which the awards will deliver will be
determined as a percentage of the issued share capital of the
Company at the time a milestone is achieved. The LTIP may
therefore be categorised as a “value creation plan” or “VCP”,
rather than a standard “long-term incentive plan” or “LTIP”,
under which awards are granted over numbers of shares
which are fixed at the time of grant, subject to achievement of
certain performance conditions.
•	The Company’s intention is that the LTIP will be put to
shareholders for their approval at the Company’s first AGM
after the Uplisting. It is intended to have a single operation,
in that one round of awards will be granted immediately
following the AGM and then the LTIP will close to new grants.
The Company would then need to seek further shareholder
approval to grant equity based incentive awards in the future.
Given the context of the Uplisting, the Company has taken
into account features which are considered market standard
for a VCP operated by a company listed on the Main Market.
In particular, the Company has considered the commentary
on VCPs on pages 12 and 13 of the Investment Association’s
Principles of Remuneration and the “Remuneration” section of
the UK Corporate Governance Code (“UKCGC”).
The milestones and equity grants are as follows:

Strategic report


Directors’ report
The Smarter Web Company PLC (the ‘Company’) – having
changed its name from Uranium Energy Exploration PLC on
25 April 2025 – is a public company incorporated in England
and Wales (company number 00092343) with its registered
address at 160 Aztec West, Almondsbury, Bristol, BS32 4TU,
United Kingdom. The Company’s Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) is
213800VQO9FUG4PZMP73.
The Company’s website is at www.smarterwebcompany.co.uk.

In addition to the listings listed above, on 11 June 2025 the
Company’s Ordinary Shares approved to trade on the OTCQB

Dividend
The Directors do not propose a dividend (2024: £nil dividend) for
the year.

The Company is the sole shareholder of both Smarter Web

100 per cent. of the voting rights over each such subsidiary.

As reported in the Company’s prospectus supporting its admission
to the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange (16 January 2026

no intention to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, with excess
profits expected to be applied to further growth of the business or
held in treasury pursuant the Group’s Bitcoin Treasury Policy. The
Company will review the dividend policy periodically, and any future
payment of dividends will be subject to maintaining an appropriate
level of dividend cover and the need to retain sufficient funds for
reinvestment in the business, to finance any capital expenditure and
for other working capital purposes. The Group does not currently
have distributable reserves to pay dividends and there is no certainty
that the Group will ever pay a dividend.

For year-ended 31 October 2025, the Company did not form a
Nominations Committee. Nominations were considered by the
Board. With the Company joining the Main Market of the London
Stock Exchange as a commercial company and its adoption of
the UK Corporate Governance Code from 3 February 2026, the
Company now has the following Board Committees:

Risks associated with the use of financial instruments by the
Company are reported in Note 26 to the Financial Statements.

During year ended 31 October 2025 the Company was an
unquoted company and did not meet the requirements to
report greenhouse emissions or energy consumption under The
Large and Medium-sized Companies and Group (Accounts and
Reports) Regulations 2008.
After the year being reported, on 3 February 2026, the
Company’s securities - Ordinary Shares of GBP0.001 each; fully
paid (ISIN: GB00BPJHZ015) – were admitted to the Official List
at which time the Company became a quoted company. The
Company has 11 employees and no physical office. The nature
of the Company’s operations require it to operate standard
office equipment only. Additionally, many staff work from home.
Consequently, the Company has a small carbon footprint and
does not consume over 40,000 kWh and accordingly energy
consumption and energy efficiency disclosures have not been
provided in this report.
As a consequence of the small carbon footprint of the Company
and that the Company has become subject to the UK Listing
Rules reporting regime since 3 February 2026 when it became
a commercial company admitted to the Main Market of the
London Stock Exchange the Company has not included in this
report financial related disclosures consistent with the TCFD
Recommended Disclosure.

Corporate governance statements

• Audit and Risk Committee

From 25 April 2025 to 2 February 2026, the Company adopted
the QCA Code of Governance (details of the Code are available
from https://www.theqca.com/qca-corporate-governancecode-public/), and after the year being reported, upon joining
the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange (commercial
company) on 3 February 2026, the Company adopted the UK
Corporate Governance Code (available from https://www.frc.
org.uk/library/standards-codes-policy/corporate-governance/ukcorporate-governance-code/).

The details and membership of these Committees can be found
on the Company’s website (under Shareholders > Corporate
governance).

The Board is responsible for leading and controlling the Group
and has overall authority for the management and conduct of
the Group’s business and its strategy and development.

Political donations and expenditure

The Board is committed to the highest standards of corporate
governance.

• Disclosure Committee
• Nomination Committee
• Remuneration Committee

During the year, there were no political donations made by the
Company nor did it incur any political expenditure (2024: £nil).

Other than as noted below, following Admission to the Main
Market of the London Stock Exchange on 3 February 2026,


Director’s Report continued

the Group will comply, and intends to continue to comply, with
the relevant principles and provisions of the UK Corporate
Governance Code.
The Company will report to its Shareholders on its compliance
with the UK Corporate Governance Code in accordance with
the UK Listing Rules.
As envisaged by the UK Corporate Governance Code, the
Board has established three committees: an Audit and Risk
Committee, a Remuneration Committee and a Nomination
Committee. The Board has also established a Disclosure
Committee. If the need should arise, the Board may establish
additional committees as appropriate.
The UK Corporate Governance Code recommends that at least
half the board of directors of a UK listed company (excluding the
Chair) should comprise “independent” non-executive directors.
On Admission, the majority of the Board will comprise NonExecutive Directors, with half of the Board, comprising Randal
Casson, Martin Thomas and Sean Wade, regarded by the
Company as independent Non-Executive Directors within the
meaning of the UK Corporate Governance Code and free from
any business or other relationship that could materially interfere
with the exercise of their independent judgement.
Whilst it is noted that Sean previously served as an executive
director of Uranium Energy Exploration plc (the Company’s
former name prior to the reverse takeover on 24 April 2025),
since that transaction Sean has not held any executive or
operational role within the Company. Furthermore, the Board
considers Sean’s shareholding to be at a level that does not
compromise his independence; therefore, the Board regards
Sean as independent.
Accordingly, whilst the Company does not currently comply with
the recommendation that more than half of the Board (excluding
the Chair) are independent Non-Executive Directors, the
balance of the Board is deemed to be appropriate to provide
adequate corporate governance at this stage in the Company’s
development. It is, however, noted that the Company intends to
comply with this requirement of the UK Corporate Governance
Code and accordingly will actively seek to appoint a further
independent Non-Executive Director in due course subject to
identifying appropriate candidates. If the Company has not
appointed more independent Non-Executive Directors when
it publishes its next annual report it will make appropriate
disclosures and explanations regarding the composition of the
Company’s Board.
The UK Corporate Governance Code recommends that the
Board should appoint one of its independent Non-Executive
Directors to be the senior independent director (SID) to provide
a sounding board for the Chair and to serve as an intermediary

for the other Directors when necessary. The SID should be
available to shareholders if concerns remain unresolved after
contacting the Chair or the executive directors through the
normal channels, or where such channel of communication is
inappropriate. The Company’s SID is Randal Casson.
The UK Corporate Governance Code further recommends
that a workforce engagement director is appointed; being
an individual that understands the Group’s and other key
stakeholders’ views to be taken into consideration in Board
discussions and decision-making. The Company’s workforce
engagement director is Randal Casson.
The UK Corporate Governance Code further recommends that
directors should be subject to annual re-election. The Company
intends to comply with this recommendation.
In the future, the Company may seek to incentivise its NonExecutive Directors through the issue of share options, including
through the Discretionary Share Plans, provided that this does
not compromise the independence of its independent NonExecutive Directors.
The UK Corporate Governance Code recommends that the
pension contribution rates for executive directors should be aligned
with those available to the workforce. At present the executive
directors of the Company are entitled to maximum employer
pension contributions of 5 per cent. of qualifying earnings, and
non-board employees are entitled to maximum employer pension
contributions of 3 per cent. of qualifying earnings.

Share dealing
The Group has adopted, with effect from Admission to the
London Stock Exchange, a code of securities dealings in relation
to the Ordinary shares and a policy with respect to entry into
transactions with persons related to the Group which aids
compliance with the UK Market Abuse Regulation and will apply
to the Directors and other relevant employees of the Group.

Post balance sheet events
For a summary of post balance sheet events, see Note 30 to the
Financial Statements.

Statement as to disclosure to auditors
The Directors who were in office on the date of approval of
these financial statements have confirmed that, as far as they
are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which
the Auditor is unaware. The Directors have each confirmed
that they have taken all the steps that they ought to have
taken as Directors in order to make themselves aware of any
relevant audit information and to establish that it has been
communicated to the Auditor.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in
respect of the Directors’ Report and the
Financial Statements
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report
and the Group and Parent Company financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent
Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that
law, they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in
accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards
and applicable law and have elected to prepare the Parent
Company financial statements on the same basis.
Under Company law, the Directors must not approve the
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent
Company and of the Group’s profit or loss for that period. In
preparing each of the Group and Parent Company financial
statements, the Directors are required to:
•	Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
•	Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant,
reliable and prudent;
•	State whether they have been prepared in accordance with
applicable accounting standards in conformity with the
requirements of the Companies Act 2006;
•	Assess the Group and Parent Company’s ability to continue
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related
to going concern; and
•	Use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either
intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to
cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any
time, the financial position of the Company and enable
them to ensure that its financial statements comply with
the Companies Act 2006. They are responsible for such
internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the
preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have general
responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to

them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and
detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report,
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance
Statement that comply with that law and those regulations. The
Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity
of the corporate and financial information included on the
Company’s website.

Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect
of the Annual Financial Report
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are set out
on pages 20 to 22 of this Annual Report, confirm that, to the
best of their knowledge:
•	The financial statements, prepared in accordance with the
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or
loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the
consolidation taken as a whole; and
•	The Strategic Report/Directors’ Report include a fair review of
the development and performance of the business and the
position of the issuer and the undertakings included in the
consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of
the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
The Directors consider the Annual Report and Accounts, taken
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides
the information necessary for Shareholders to assess the
Company’s position and performance, business model and
strategy.

Adopting the going concern statement
(UKLR 6.6.6 R(3))
The Directors have prepared the financial accounts of the
Company on the basis that it is a going concern. The going
concern statement is on page 44.

Opinion

Conclusions relating to going concern

We have audited the financial statements of The Smarter Web
Company PLC (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the
‘group’) for the year ended 31 October 2025 which comprise
the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the
Consolidated and parent Company Statements of Financial
Position, the Consolidated and parent Company Statements of
Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
and notes to the financial statements, including significant
accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has
been applied in the preparation of the group financial statements
is applicable law and UK-adopted international accounting
standards and as regards the parent company financial
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the
Companies Act 2006. The financial reporting framework that has
been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial
statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting
Standards, including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework.

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that
the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in
the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our
evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the group’s and parent
company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis
of accounting included:

In our opinion:
•	the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state
of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at
31 October 2025 and of the group’s profit for the year then
ended;
•	the group financial statements have been properly prepared
in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting
standards;
•	the parent company financial statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice; and
•	the financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

•	Reviewing the directors’ assessment of going concern and
disclosures within the financial statements;
•	Determining if all relevant information has been included in
the assessment of going concern, including considering the
completeness of forecast expenditure;
•	Analysing the forecasts up to 30 June 2026 and reviewing
the key underlying assumptions in relation to expenditure and
checking the mathematical accuracy of management’s going
concern model;
•	Challenging management over the key underlying
assumptions and inputs;
• Performed a sensitivity analysis on assumptions used; and
•	Inspecting the bank balances up to the date of approval of
the financial statements.
Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified
any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that,
individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the
group’s or parent company’s ability to continue as a going
concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the
financial statements are authorised for issue.
Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with
respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections
of this report.

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described
in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report. We are independent of the
group and parent company in accordance with the ethical
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial
statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as
applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Our application of materiality
Materiality is an expression of the relative significance of a particular matter in the context of the financial statements as a whole.
An item, either individually or in aggregate, is considered material if omitting it or misstating it could reasonably be expected to
influence decisions that users make on the basis of an entity’s financial statements. Materiality has both quantitative and qualitative
characteristics. It depends on the size or nature of the item or error judged in the particular circumstances of its omission
or misstatement.

Group materiality based on 1% of net assets. We set this
benchmark because users’ focus at present is on the valuation
of its bitcoin treasury whilst the group seeks to expand its
primary operations, net assets is therefore the most relevant
benchmark, and 1% provides an appropriately conservative
threshold given cryptocurrency price volatility.
We have applied performance materiality at 70% of overall
materiality, reflecting the client’s low-risk profile while
accommodating the incremental risk associated with the
first‑year audit and operating environment.

Permitted percentage of group performance materiality.

We also determine a level of performance materiality which we use to assess the extent of testing needed to reduce the risk that the
aggregated uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality for the financial statements as a whole to an acceptably
low level. Performance materiality was set at being 70% of materiality for the financial statements as a whole. The performance
materiality threshold was considered to be sufficient to provide coverage of significant and residual risks to the balances within the
financial statements representing risk areas and those that require management judgements and estimates.
We applied the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit, and in evaluating the impact of misstatements.

Our approach to the audit
In designing our audit approach, we determined materiality and assessed risk of material misstatement in the financial statements.
In particular, we looked at areas involving significant accounting estimates and judgements by the directors, including the valuation
of cryptocurrency assets and classification and valuation of convertible loan notes. For the most significant assessed risks of
misstatement, the procedures performed are outlined below in the key audit matters section of this report. We re-assessed the risks
throughout the audit process and concluded that the scope remained in line with that determined at the planning stage of the audit,
with The Smarter Web Company PLC being the only material component.


Strategic report


Independent auditor’s report continued

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to
fraud) we identified, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the
audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Key Audit Matter

How our scope addressed this matter

Recognition and valuation of cryptocurrency assets (Note 14)
At the year end, the Group holds £220m
worth of Bitcoin across multiple wallets
and platforms. This creates heightened risk
around existence, rights and obligations,
and valuation. The decentralised nature of
cryptocurrency, combined with the use of
multiple wallets and exchanges, increases
the risk of misappropriation, loss of access,
or misstatement. Additionally, Bitcoin’s price
volatility poses a significant risk to accurate
valuation at the reporting date.

Our procedures included:
•	Confirming good title to and quantities of the crypto assets within the Group’s wallets and obtain
direct confirmation from the custodian;
•	Review and testing underlying agreements giving rise to the receipt of crypto assets;
•	Agreeing the fair values of the crypto assets at the and year-end date and reperforming valuation
against alternative sources;
•	Discussing with management the strategy for the holding of digital assets and reviewing the
relevant accounting treatment applied; and
•	Substantively testing transfers of cryptocurrency assets between wallets on different platforms.

Recognition and valuation of the Group’s
Based on the procedures performed, no misstatements were identified, and we conclude that the
cryptocurrency assets (Note 14) was a key
Group’s Bitcoin holdings existed, were under the Group’s control, and were appropriately valued at
audit matter due to the material magnitude
the reporting date.
of the £220m Bitcoin balance, the
decentralised custody across multiple wallets
and platforms, and the high price volatility
at the reporting date, which increased the
risk of misstatement in existence, rights and
valuation and required significant auditor
judgement and effort.

Other information
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s
report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our opinion on the group
and parent company financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated
in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained
in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent
material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements
themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we
are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.


Independent auditor’s report continued

Opinions on other matters prescribed by
the Companies Act 2006

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of
the financial statements

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of
the audit:

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee
that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if,
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on
the basis of these financial statements.

•	the information given in the strategic report and the directors’
report for the financial year for which the financial statements
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the strategic report and the directors’ report have been
prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Matters on which we are required to
report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group
and the parent company and their environment obtained
in the course of the audit, we have not identified material
misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in
relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report
to you if, in our opinion:
•	adequate accounting records have not been kept by the
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not
been received from branches not visited by us; or
•	the parent company financial statements are not in
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
•	certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law
are not made; or
•	we have not received all the information and explanations we
require for our audit.

Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities
statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation
of the group and parent company financial statements and
for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for
such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the group and parent company financial
statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the
group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a going
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting
unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the
parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic
alternative but to do so.


Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance
with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our
responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements
in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which
our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including
fraud is detailed below:
•	We obtained an understanding of the group and the sector
in which it operates to identify laws and regulations that
could reasonably be expected to have a direct effect on
the financial statements. We obtained our understanding in
this regard through discussions with management, industry
research and application of cumulative audit knowledge.
•	We determined the principal laws and regulations relevant to
the group in this regard to be those arising from:
o

	Quoted Companies Alliance Corporate Governance Code
(QCA Code)

o

	Aquis Stock Exchange (AQSE) Rules

o

	UK Companies Act 2006

o

	Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)

o

	Market Abuse Regulation (MAR)

o

	UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR)

o

	Data Protection Act 2018

o

	Consumer Rights Act 2015

o

	Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002,
Money laundering & Fraud

o

	FCA Crypto Asset Oversight

o

	HMRC Crypto Asset Tax Guidance

Strategic report


Independent auditor’s report continued

• We designed our audit procedures to ensure the audit
team considered whether there were any indications of
non‑compliance by the group with those laws and regulations.
These procedures included, but were not limited to:
o

	Making enquiries of management;

o

	Review of board minutes with governance and Regulatory
News Service announcements; and

o

	Review of legal and professional fees and understanding
the nature of the costs and the existence of any
non‑compliance with laws and regulations.

•	We also identified the risks of material misstatement of the
financial statements due to fraud. We considered, in addition
to the non-rebuttable presumption of a risk of fraud arising
from management override of controls, that there were no
other significant fraud risks.
•	As in all of our audits, we addressed the risk of fraud arising
from management override of controls by performing audit
procedures which included, but were not limited to: the
testing of journals; reviewing accounting estimates for
evidence of bias; and evaluating the business rationale of any
significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal
course of business.

Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as
a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so
that we might state to the company’s members those matters
we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone, other than the
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Because of the inherent limitations of an audit, there is a
risk that we will not detect all irregularities, including those
leading to a material misstatement in the financial statements
or non‑compliance with regulation. This risk increases the
more that compliance with a law or regulation is removed
from the events and transactions reflected in the financial
statements, as we will be less likely to become aware of
instances of non-compliance. The risk is also greater regarding
irregularities occurring due to fraud rather than error, as fraud
involves intentional concealment, forgery, collusion, omission
or misrepresentation.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of
the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting
Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This
description forms part of our auditor’s report.

Notes to the consolidated financial
statements
For the year ended 31 October 2025

1. General Information
The Smarter Web Company Plc (the “Company”), formerly
Uranium Energy Exploration Plc, is a public limited company
incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The
Company’s registered address is 160 Aztec West, Almondsbury,
Bristol, United Kingdom, BS32 4TU.
On 25 April 2025, the Company acquired the entire issued
share capital of The Smarter Web Company Operations Limited
(“SWC Ltd”) and listed on the Aquis Stock Exchange. Details
of the acquisition are included in note 28. After the year end,
the Company’s shares were admitted to trading on the London
Stock Exchange.

2. Material Accounting Policies
(a) Basis of preparation of financial statements
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting
Standards (“IAS”) and the requirements of the Companies
Act 2006. The consolidated financial statements have been
prepared under the historical cost convention, except for
revaluation of assets and liabilities recognised at fair value.
The consolidated financial statements include the results of
the Company and its subsidiaries (together the “Group”) and
are presented in Pound Sterling, which is the presentational
currency.
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with IAS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires Directors to exercise their
judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting
policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement
or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are
significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed
in note 3.
Going concern
As at 31 October 2025 the Group had a cash balance of
£1,503,118 (31 October 2024: £109,252), and net assets of
£210,379,352 (31 October 2024: net liabilities £921,384).
The Directors have considered the applicability of the going
concern basis in the preparation of these consolidated financial
statements. This included the review of internal budgets and
financial results which show, taking into account reasonably
probable changes in financial performance that the Group
should be able to operate within the level of its current funding
arrangements.


The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group
will have ample resources to continue in operation for the
foreseeable future, underpinned by the successful completion
of several fundraises during the year, which have further
strengthened the Group’s liquidity position. For this reason,
the Directors have adopted the going concern basis in the
preparation of these consolidated financial statements.

(b) New and amended standards and
interpretations
The following amendments to IAS became effective for the
annual reporting period beginning on 1 November 2024 and
did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial
statements:
•	Amendments to IAS 1 – ‘Classification of Liabilities as
Current or Non-current’;
•	Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 – ‘Supplier Finance
Arrangements’;
•	Amendments to IAS 1 – ‘Non-current Liabilities with
Covenants’; and
•	Amendments to IFRS 16 – ‘Lease Liability in a Sale and
Leaseback’.
At the date of approval of these financial statements, the
following standards and interpretations which have not been
applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet
effective:

Standard

Effective for
accounting
periods beginning
on or after

Amendments to IAS 21 – ‘Lack of
Exchangeability’

1 January 2025

Amendments to IFRS 7 and IFRS 9 –
‘Classification and Measurement of Financial
Instruments and Contracts referencing naturedependant electricity’

1 January 2026

Annual improvements to IFRS accounting
standards (volume 11)

1 January 2026

IFRS 18 – ‘Presentation and Disclosures in
Financial Statements’

1 January 2027

IFRS 19 – Subsidiaries without Public
Accountability: Disclosures

1 January 2025
(Not yet endorsed
in the UK)

The Directors do not expect that the adoption of these
standards will have a material impact on the consolidated
financial statements in future periods.

Strategic report


Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

(c) Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control
exists when the Company is exposed to, or has rights to,
variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the
ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results
of business combinations using the acquisition method. In the
consolidated statement of financial position, the acquiree’s
identifiable assets and liabilities are initially recognised at their fair
values at the acquisition date. The results of acquired operations
are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive
income from the date on which control is obtained. They are
deconsolidated from the date on which control ceases.
Intragroup balances, and any gains and losses or income and
expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in
preparing the consolidated financial statements.

(d) Cryptocurrency
The Group’s holding in Bitcoin is accounted for as an intangible
asset with an indefinite useful economic life. Bitcoin is traded in
an active market and the Directors have adopted the revaluation
measurement model.
Bitcoin purchases are initially recognised at cost and are
subsequently re-valued to fair value based on the market price
provided by the Group’s cryptocurrency brokers. Increases in
the carrying amounts arising on revaluation are recognised,
net of tax, in other comprehensive income and accumulated in
the revaluation reserve in equity. To the extent that the increase
reverses a decrease previously recognised in profit or loss,
the increase is first recognised in profit or loss. Decreases that
reverse previous increases of the same asset are first recognised
in other comprehensive income to the extent of the remaining
surplus attributable to the asset. All other decreases are charged
to profit or loss.
On disposal, any associated revaluation surplus is transferred
directly to retained earnings and is not recycled through profit
or loss.
Cryptocurrency is held for long term appreciation in line with
the Group’s treasury policy and therefore is classified as a noncurrent asset in the consolidated statement of financial position.

(e) Other intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business
combination over the Group’s interest in the fair value of
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is not amortised and is stated at cost less any
accumulated impairment losses.

The recoverable amount of goodwill is tested for impairment
annually or when events or changes in circumstance indicate
that it might be impaired. Impairment charges are deducted
from the carrying value and recognised immediately in the
consolidated statement of comprehensive income. For the
purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each
of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from
synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount of the
cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the
unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying
amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the
other assets of the unit pro-rata based on the carrying amount
of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for
goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Acquisition related intangible assets
Net assets acquired as part of a business combination includes
an assessment of the fair value of separately identifiable
acquisition-related intangible assets, in addition to other
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities purchased. These are
amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives which
are individually assessed.
The intangible assets acquired by the Group in a business
combination, and their useful economic lives and the methods
used to determine the cost of each intangible are as follows:
Amortisation period of intangible assets
Intangible asset

Amortisation period

Brand

15 years

Customer relationships

15 years

Software

15 years

(f) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recognised so as to
write off the cost of assets less their residual values over their
useful lives on the following basis:
Furniture and fittings

10% straight-line basis

(g) Right-of-use asset
The Group recognises right-of-use assets under lease
agreements in which it is the lessee. The underlying asset
comprises a motor vehicle and is used in the normal course
of business. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at
the present value of lease payments made at or before the
commencement date as well as any initial direct costs and an
estimate of costs to be incurred in dismantling the asset. Lease
incentives are deducted from the cost of the right-of-use asset.
The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the lease-term and if
necessary impaired in accordance with applicable standards.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

(h) Lease liabilities
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the
lease payments that are not paid at that date, discounted using
the rate implicit in the lease. The lease liability is subsequently
measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest
on the lease liability (application of the effective interest
method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the
lease payments made. No lease modification or reassessment
changes have been made during the reporting period from
changes in any lease terms or rent charges.

(i) Equity
Share capital
Share capital represents the nominal value of ordinary equity
shares.
Share premium
Share premium represents the excess over nominal value
of the fair value of consideration received for equity shares.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new equity
shares are deducted from the share premium account.
Merger relief reserve
Merger relief reserve represents the excess over nominal value
of the fair value of consideration received for equity shares
issued by the Company as part of an acquisition of subsidiary,
where merger relief under section 612 of the Companies Act
2006 applies.
Warrant reserve
Warrant reserve represents the fair value of outstanding warrants
as at the date of issue by the Company.
Accumulated losses
Retained earnings and accumulated losses consist of cumulative
net gains and losses recognised in the consolidated statement
of comprehensive income plus transactions recognised directly
in equity.

(j) Financial assets
Classification
The Group classifies its financial assets into two categories,
being financial assets held at amortised cost and financial assets
held at fair value through profit or loss.
Amortised cost
Financial assets held at amortised cost comprise trade and other
receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed
or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
market. They arise principally through the provision of goods

and services to customers (e.g., trade receivables) but also
incorporate other types of financial assets where the objective is
to hold their assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and
the contractual cash flows are solely payments of the principal
and interest. They are initially recognised at fair value plus
transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition
or issue and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using
the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.
Impairment provisions for trade and other receivables are
recognised based on the simplified approach within IFRS
9 using the lifetime expected credit losses (“ECL”) method.
During this process the probability of the non-payment of
the receivables is assessed. This probability is then multiplied
by the amount of the expected loss arising from default to
determine the lifetime ECL for the receivables. For trade and
other receivables, which are reported net, such provisions are
recorded in a separate provision account with the loss being
recognised within administrative expenses in the consolidated
statement of comprehensive income. On confirmation that
the trade or other receivable will not be collectable, the gross
carrying value of the asset is written off against the associated
provision.
Fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss comprise
equity investments. These are carried in the statement of
financial position at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition,
changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss.

(k) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise of balances held in
current bank accounts and payment processors that are readily
available for use in the Group’s operations.

(l) Financial liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities are classified as either carried at
fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”) or at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities are classified as current liabilities unless,
at the end of the reporting period, the Group has a right to
defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the
reporting period.
Financial liabilities carried at FVTPL and Day 1 losses
The Group’s financial liabilities carried at FVTPL consist of
Smarter Convert CLN, detailed in note 24(d), which has been
designated by the Directors as carried at FVTPL. The Directors
can designate a financial liability as carried at FVTPL when it
forms part of a contract containing one or more non-closely
related embedded derivatives, and IFRS 9 Financial Instrument
(“IFRS 9”) permits the entire combined contract to be
designated as such.

Strategic report


Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

Financial liabilities carried at FVTPL are initially recognised at fair
value with the associated transaction costs recognised in profit
or loss. If the fair value at initial recognition is determined using
a Level 3 valuation technique and is higher than the transaction
price (being the gross proceeds received), then the resulting
difference represents a loss (“Day 1 loss”) and is released into the
profit or loss over the term of the instrument on a straight-line
basis within other gains and losses.
Changes in the fair value of the financial liabilities that are
designated as carried at FVTPL are recognised in profit or loss
within other gains and losses, except for the amount of change
in the fair value of the financial liability that is attributable to
changes in the credit risk of that liability which is recognised in
other comprehensive income.
Financial liabilities carried at FVTPL are presented net of Day
1 losses on the face of the consolidated statement of financial
position.
Financial liabilities carried at amortised cost
The Group’s financial liabilities carried at amortised cost
comprise of trade and other payables and borrowings not
designated as carried at FVTPL and are recognised initially at
fair value based on amounts exchanged, net of transaction costs
and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method.

(m) Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual
interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recognised at the
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

(n) Compound instruments
The component parts of convertible loan notes issued by
the Group are classified separately as financial liabilities and
equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual
arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an
equity instrument. A conversion option that will be settled by the
exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset
for a fixed number of equity instruments issued by the Group is
an equity instrument.

(o) Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration
received or receivable and represents amounts receivable
for services provided in the normal course of business, net of
discounts and VAT.
The Group’s revenue arises from the provision of website
development services. Revenue is recognised by reference to
the stage of completion of the contract. The stage of completion

of a contract is measured by comparing the costs incurred
for work performed to date to the total estimated contract
costs. Revenue is only recognised to the extent of recoverable
expenses when the outcome of a contract cannot be estimated
reliably.

(p) Employee benefits: pension obligations
The Group operates a defined contribution plan for its
employees. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under
which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity.
Once the contributions have been paid the Group has no
further payment obligations. The contributions are recognised
as an expense in profit or loss when they fall due. If contribution
payments exceed the contribution due for service, the excess is
recognised as a prepayment.

(q) Other income and gains
Other income and gains comprise of net gains and losses on
instruments held at fair value through profit or loss and loans
written off during the year.

(r) Finance costs
Finance costs comprise of interest payable on leases and other
financial liabilities which are expensed in the period in which
they are incurred.

(s) Taxation
Corporation tax for the period presented comprises current and
deferred tax. Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit
or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in
other comprehensive income, in which case they are recognised
in other comprehensive income.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in profit or loss
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable
or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that
are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current
tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable
on differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities in consolidated financial statements and the
corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable
profit and is accounted for using the liability method. Deferred
tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary
differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the
extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available


Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary
difference arises from the initial recognition (other than in a
business combination or for transactions that give rise to equal
taxable and deductible temporary differences) of other assets
and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable
profit nor the accounting profit. In addition, a deferred tax
liability is not recognised if the temporary difference arises from
the initial recognition of goodwill.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at
each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available
to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax
is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the
period when the liability is settled, or the asset is realised based
on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively
enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a
legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against
current tax liabilities, when they relate to income taxes levied by
the same taxation authority and the Directors intend to settle the
Group’s current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

(t) Share-based payments
Equity-settled share-based payment transactions with parties
other than employees are measured at the fair value of the
goods or services received, except where that fair value cannot
be estimated reliably, in which case they are measured at the fair
value of the equity instruments granted, measured at the date
the entity obtains the goods, or the counterparty renders the
service. The share-based payment expense is either recognised
in profit or loss or recognised as deduction in share premium.
A corresponding increase in the warrant reserve is also
recognised.

(u) Operating segments
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent
with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating
decision-maker (“CODM”). The CODM, who is responsible
for allocating resources and assessing performance of the
operating segments, has been identified as the Board of
Directors that makes strategic decisions. The Group consists
of one operating segment, being the provision of website
development services and therefore no segmental reporting is
presented.


3. Critical accounting judgements and
key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the accounting policies, which are
described in note 2, the Directors are required to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions which affect reported
income, expenses, assets, liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities. The estimates and associated assumptions
are based on historical experience, expectations of future events
and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances. Actual results in the future could differ from
such estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions
are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the revision is
made.

(a) Critical judgements in applying the Group’s
accounting policies
Accounting for warrants attached to convertible loan notes
Warrants that were issued in conjunction with the conversion of
convertible loan notes (see note 21) have been accounted for
from the date of conversion when the terms of instruments were
determined, as opposed to the date of inception of the loans.
On conversion and issue of the warrants, the warrants met the
definition of equity instruments under IAS 32, and accordingly,
were recognised in the warrant reserve at fair value with a
corresponding reduction in share premium.

(b) Key sources of estimated uncertainty
Identifiable assets and liabilities assumed on acquisition of
subsidiary
The fair value of intangible assets acquired through business
combinations involves the use of valuation techniques and the
estimation of future cash flows to be generated over several
years. Further details of the business combination are included
in note 28.
Valuation of Smarter Convert CLN
Smarter Convert CLN is a financial liability carried at FVTPL.
Its valuation requires the use of the Monte Carlo method
to estimate the Company’s future share price as well as
the Directors’ estimate of future price of Bitcoin. Details of
instrument and the valuation technique used are included in
notes 24(d) and 26(b) respectively.

On 4 September 2025, the Company issued 21,000,000 at par value pursuant to a subscription agreement with its broker. Under the
agreement, the broker may sell ordinary shares on behalf of the Company subject to agreed restrictions, including weekly volume limits
linked to market trading closing price, and the Company will benefit by receiving approximately 97% of the net proceeds of any sales
of the shares achieved by the broker. As at 31 October 2025, a balance of 17,722,000 shares had not yet been placed. At 31 October

As part of the Aquis IPO, the Company issued further 2,450,000 warrants to advisors on the same terms as the warrants detailed
above. This represents an equity settled share-based payment, which was recognised at the fair value of the warrants issued.
On 9 October 2025, the Company issued warrants in connection with an equity placing of 9,680,640 ordinary shares. The warrants
entitle the holder to subscribe for one ordinary share at a fixed exercise price of £1.50 and are exercisable over a contractual term of
36 months. As the placing price for the shares and warrants of £1.00 was below the quoted market price of the Company’s shares of
£1.02 at the grant date, no fair value is attributed to these warrants.
No warrants were issued during the year ended 31 October 2024.
The warrants are not subsequently revalued.

(a) February 2025 Convertible loan note
In February 2025, the Company issued convertible loan notes (“Feb CLN”) to various pre-IPO investors, totalling £1,356,752 who
had originally subscribed for shares in the Company in connection with a previous aborted IPO. The loan notes entitled the holders to
receive shares on IPO at a 20% discount to the IPO price, along with one warrant for each share received.
The loan notes had the option to be redeemed in cash in the event of a default. The loan notes mandatorily converted to shares on
IPO date, being 25 April 2025. The effective interest on the financial liability element of the loan note is recorded as a finance cost
of £339,188. On IPO, the terms of the warrants were finalised and entitled the shareholders to subscribe for additional shares at fixed
price, the IPO price, leading to the warrants being recognised as equity instruments at fair value. The value of the warrants issued
totals £833,306 and is recognised in equity in the Warrant Reserve, with the corresponding reduction in share premium as part of
IPO share issue costs.

(b) Loan from Power Metal Resources Plc
The loan from Power Metal Resources Plc (“POW”) was written off during the year ended 31 October 2025 with the corresponding
gain recognised in other income in profit or loss. The loan from POW was provided in connection with an acquisition opportunity
related to an asset owned by POW, however the transaction ultimately did not complete, and the loan was written off. At the time
of the write-off, Sean Wade was the chief executive officer of both POW and the Company however he did not have a controlling
interest in either company.

(c) Convertible loan facility and other borrowings
The Convertible loan facility was also repaid during the period. Other borrowings consisted of pre-IPO investors who were either
repaid or refinanced into Feb CLN detailed above.

(d) Smarter Convert CLN
On 5 August 2025, the Company issued a convertible loan note (“Smarter Convert CLN”) raising gross proceeds of £15,803,733,
which were used to acquire 177.8909127 Bitcoins and are held in a segregated wallet. The instrument is interest-free and has a
term of one year. On maturity, the instrument can be settled as follows, at the option of the noteholders (“Settlement”):
(i) Full or partial conversion of the notes into Company shares at £2.0475 per share; or
(ii) Transfer of the Bitcoin acquired less transaction costs; or
(iii) Payment of the equivalent of the value of Bitcoin in GBP, USD, or EUR;
The noteholders have the option to trigger Settlement at any time. The Company has the option to trigger Settlement after
5 February 2026, if both the market price of the Company shares exceeds £3.07125 per share for 10 consecutive trading days,
and the percentage increase in the Company’s share price over that period exceeds the percentage increase in the price of Bitcoin.


Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

The instrument was analysed in accordance with the requirements of IAS 32 and IFRS 9 and the Directors have elected on initial
recognition to designate the whole instrument as a financial liability measured at fair value through profit or loss as the instrument
contains a non-closely-related embedded derivative.
The fair value of Smarter Convert CLN at initial recognition was calculated using Level 3 valuation techniques detailed in note 26(b).
As the fair value at of the liability at initial recognition exceeds the cash proceeds, the resulting loss, Day 1 loss, is released into the
profit or loss over the term of instrument. The initial recognition of Smarter Convert CLN is detailed below:

(b) Fair value hierarchy
Some of the Group’s financial assets are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Valuation techniques in
determining the fair values are divided into three levels based on the quality of inputs. There were no transfers between fair value
hierarchies in the period ended 31 October 2025. (2024: None)
Level 1 – Quoted market prices
Fair value is determined by reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets where the quoted
price is readily available.
The following financial assets are recognised at fair value through profit or loss and are classified within the Level 1 category:

Listed securities

31 October 2025

£

£

1,649

-

Level 2 – Valuation techniques using observable inputs
Fair value is determined using inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are unobservable, directly or indirectly.
There were no level 2 inputs during the year.
Level 3 – Valuation techniques using significant unobservable inputs
Fair value is dependent on significant inputs that are unobservable. The following financial liabilities are recognised at fair value
through profit or loss and are classified within the Level 3 category:

Valuation technique and inputs
The fair value of the Smarter Convert CLN at initial recognition and 31 October 2025 was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation
model. The key inputs into the valuations were as follows:
5 August 2025

31 October 2025

US$ 122,055

US$ 116,210

Bitcoin prices at 5 August 2026 were derived from forward prices. The volatility of Company shares was derived from a peer group of
comparable listed companies as the Company shares have not been listed for a sufficiently long period.
No change the fair value of the Smarter Convert CLN is attributable to the changes in Company’s credit risk.
Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy
There were no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the year.

(c)

Risk management

The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework.
The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk
limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly
to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training, management standards and
procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and
obligations.
The main financial risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.

Strategic report


Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. For the Group, credit risk arises primarily from
cash balances held at banks and other receivables. The risk in relation to cash balances is mitigated by keeping cash with reputable
financial institutions with a high credit rating and keeping cash balances with payment processors for only as long as necessary.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that the Company and its subsidiaries might encounter difficulty in settling its debts or
otherwise meeting its obligations related to financial liabilities. The Directors manage this risk by monitoring its financial resources and
carefully planning its expenditure programmes. The Group has successfully raised finance, and the Directors consider the Group’s
investment in cryptocurrencies to be highly liquid.
Contractual maturity dates of the Group’s financial liabilities are detailed below. The amounts are undiscounted contractual payments
and thus include future interest and charges.

The contractual amount payable on the Smarter Convert CLN, as detailed in note 24(d), is based on the price of Bitcoin at the date of
settlement and is subject to the noteholder electing to redeem the note in cash, unless converted earlier by the Company. The figure
used in the table above is based on the Directors’ estimated price of Bitcoin when the instrument matures on 25 August 2026.
The Group has sufficient cash reserves to meet its lease and trade and other payables liabilities.
Market risk
The Group is not materially exposed to currency and interest rate risk. The Group’s market risk exposure is limited to price fluctuations
in the value of Bitcoin, which the Directors monitor closely and do not generally rely on to fund working capital requirements. The
Group’s remaining investment in listed securities is minimal and is not considered material.

(d) Capital risk management
The Board’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, to enable the
Group to continue its principal activities, and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. The Group’s capital
consists primarily of equity.

Notes to the parent company
financial statements
for the year ended 31 October 2025

C1 Basis of preparation of the Company
financial statements
The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity
under FRS 100 ‘Financial Reporting Standard 100’ issued by
the Financial Reporting Council. Accordingly, the financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101
‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ and in accordance with
the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies using
FRS 101.
The Company previously prepared its financial statements in
accordance with IAS. Due to the similarities between FRS 101
and IAS, there are no adjustments on transition to FRS 101.
The Company financial statements have been prepared on the
going concern basis and under the historical cost convention,
except for revaluation of assets and liabilities recognised at
fair value.
The Company financial statements are presented in Pound
Sterling, which is its functional and presentational currency.
Preparation of financial statements under FRS 101 requires the
application of the recognition, measurement and disclosure
requirements of IAS but allows for the following disclosure
exemptions:
•	FRS 101.8 (d): the requirements of IFRS 7 ‘Financial
Instruments: Disclosures’ to make disclosures about financial
instruments;
•	FRS 101.8 (e): the requirements of IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value
Measurement’ (disclosure of valuation techniques and inputs
used for fair value measurement of assets and liabilities);
•	FRS 101.8 (g): the requirements of paragraphs 10(d),
10(f), 16, 38A, 38B, 38C, 38D, 111, and 134 to 136 of IAS 1
‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ to produce a cash flow
statement and to make an explicit and unreserved statement
of compliance with IFRSs, additional comparative information
and capital management information;
•	FRS 101.8 (h): the requirements of IAS 7 ‘Statements of Cash
Flows’ to produce a cash flow statement and related notes;

•	FRS 101.8 (i): the requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of
IAS 8 ‘Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates
and Errors’ to include a list of new IFRSs that have been
issued but that have yet to be applied;
•	FRS 101.8 (j): the requirements of paragraph 17 of IAS 24
‘Related Party Disclosures’ (key management compensation);
•	FRS 101.8 (k): the requirements of IAS 24 ‘Related Party
Disclosures’ to disclose related party transactions entered
between two or more members of a group, provided that any
subsidiary which is party to a transaction is wholly owned by
such a member.
•	FRS 101.7A: the requirements of paragraphs 6-21 of IFRS 1
‘First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting
Standards to present an opening statement of financial
position at the date of transition.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
FRS 101 requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the
process of applying the Company’s accounting policies. The
areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or
areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the
financial statements are disclosed in note 3 to the consolidated
financial statements.

C2 Material accounting policies
The adopted principal accounting policies are the same as
those set out in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
The accounting policy described below is in addition to the
accounting policies disclosed in the consolidated financial
statements and is specific to the Company’s standalone
financial statements.
