The Smarter Web Company PLC
(“The Smarter Web Company” or "Company")

Result Of WRAP Retail Offer & Accelerated Bookbuild

The Smarter Web Company is pleased to announce the successful completion of a retail
investor offer via the Winterflood Retail Access Platform (“WRAP Retail Offer") and an
Accelerated Bookbuild (“Bookbuild”) to institutional investors through Tennyson Securities
and Peterhouse Capital Limited.

With a high level of demand from both existing and new shareholders the WRAP Retail Offer
and Bookbuild has raised approximately £13.4 million (before expenses), well above the
stated minimum of £8 million, through the issue of a total of 16,538,799 new ordinary shares
of £0.001 each ("Ordinary Shares") at £0.81 per share (“Offer Price”). The Offer Price was at
the closing bid price yesterday, 04 June 2025.

• A total of 493,827 new Ordinary Shares will be issued through the WRAP Retail Offer
at the Offer Price, raising £400,000 (before expenses)
• A total of 16,044,972 new Ordinary Shares will be issued through the Bookbuild at the
Offer Price, raising £12,996,427 (before expenses)

Please note that the WRAP Retail Offer was made in the United Kingdom as an exempt public
offer, which is subject to a €8 million fundraising limit over a 12 month period. As a result of
previous fundraises, the Company was only able to raise a maximum of approximately
£400,000 through the WRAP Retail Offer.

It is expected that Admission of the new Ordinary Shares will become effective at 08:00, on
or around 10 June 2025. The Bookbuild is conditional upon, among other things, Admission
becoming effective.
The WRAP Retail Offer and the Bookbuild Ordinary Shares, when issued, will be fully paid and
will rank pari passu in all respects with each other and with the existing Ordinary Shares of
the Company, including, without limitation, the right to receive all dividends and other
distributions declared, made or paid after the date of issue.

Total Voting Rights

Following Admission, the total number of Ordinary Shares in issue in The Smarter Web
Company will be 204,181,466 ordinary shares of £0.001 each. This figure may be used by
shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are
required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company under the
FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.
