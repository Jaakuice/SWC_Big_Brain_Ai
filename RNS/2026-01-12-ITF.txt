The Smarter Web Company PLC
(“The Smarter Web Company” or the “Company”)

Intention to transfer listing to the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange,
Proposed cancellation of the Ordinary Shares from the Aquis Growth Market
and
Notice of General Meeting

The Smarter Web Company (AQUIS: SWC | OTCQB: TSWCF | FRA: 3M8) announces its
intention to cancel the admission to trading of its ordinary shares on the Aquis Growth Market
and seek admission of its ordinary shares to the equity shares (commercial companies)
category of the FCA’s Official List and to trading on the London Stock Exchange’s Main Market
for listed securities (“Admission”) (together the “Proposed Main Market Admission”).

The Admission is subject, inter alia, to the approval by the FCA of a prospectus (the
“Prospectus”). It is expected that, subject to such approval, the Prospectus will be published
in due course and a further announcement will be made at that time. Accordingly, it is
expected that, upon Admission, the Company will change its trading venue from the Aquis
Growth Market to the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange.

Aquis Cancellation and Notice of General Meeting

The Company hereby notifies shareholders of its intention to cancel the admission of its
ordinary shares to trading on the Aquis Growth Market (“Cancellation”), subject to approval
of the proposed Admission (to be confirmed in due course). A notice of general meeting has
today been posted to shareholders seeking their approval, by way of ordinary resolution, for
the cancellation of the admission to trading on the Aquis Growth Market of the Company’s
ordinary shares to be effected on 3 February 2026, or such later date as agreed by the
directors, and for the directors of the Company to be authorised to take all action reasonable
or necessary to effect such cancellation (the “Resolution”).

The Board believes that the Resolution is in the best interests of all shareholders, so as to
facilitate Admission at the earliest opportunity, and accordingly recommends that
shareholders vote in favour of the Resolution as they intend do in respect of their own
interests in the Company’s ordinary shares (to the extent applicable).

Subject to shareholder approval at the general meeting of the Company (“General Meeting”),
the Cancellation and Admission are expected to take place on 3 February 2026.

The General Meeting will be held at 110 Aztec West, Almondsbury, Bristol, United Kingdom,
BS32 4TS on 28 January 2026 at 09:00 a.m.
