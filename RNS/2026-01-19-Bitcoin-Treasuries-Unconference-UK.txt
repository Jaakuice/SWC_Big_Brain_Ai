Bitcoin Treasuries Unconference UK

The Smarter Web Company (AQUIS: SWC | OTCQB: TSWCF | FRA: 3M8) is pleased to
announce that it will host the Bitcoin Treasuries Unconference UK, a one-day, event focused
on the rapidly evolving role of Bitcoin as corporate treasury capital.

The event will be held in Bristol, the birthplace of The Smarter Web Company, and is delivered
in partnership with the Bitcoin Treasuries Unconference team.

The Bitcoin Treasuries Unconference UK brings together senior executives, company
directors, institutional allocators and long-term Bitcoin holders for a focused exchange of real-
world experience. The programme is designed specifically for those currently holding, or
considering, Bitcoin on corporate balance sheets and for investors seeking to understand
Bitcoin as a form of digital capital.

The day will follow a carefully curated agenda of keynote speakers, moderated panels and
networking, addressing the practical realities of operating a Bitcoin treasury strategy,
including:

• Governance and board oversight
• Accounting and financial reporting
• Disclosure and investor communications
• Custody and operational security
• Risk management
• Capital markets perception
• Long-term capital and funding strategies

With more than 21 confirmed speakers, the event will feature voices from across public
markets, corporate finance, Bitcoin treasury operations and digital capital infrastructure. The
event takes place on Friday 29 May 2026 and you can view details and purchase tickets on
The Smarter Web Company website:

Attendance is strictly limited to ensure a high-quality environment for open, rigorous
discussion and meaningful connections between participants. The event will also be live
streamed online for global visibility.

This event reinforces The Smarter Web Company’s position at the forefront of corporate
adoption of Bitcoin and its commitment to supporting the development of best-practice
frameworks for companies allocating Bitcoin as part of long-term capital strategy.
Andrew Webley, CEO of The Smarter Web Company, commented:
“I would like to thank the sponsors and speakers for supporting this event. Bitcoin has moved
from being an alternative asset to becoming a serious form of corporate treasury capital. The
Bitcoin Treasuries Unconference UK brings together the people who are building and running
these strategies. Hosting this event in Bristol, where The Smarter Web Company was founded,
reflects both our roots and our belief that the UK can play a leading role in the global Bitcoin
treasury ecosystem.”
