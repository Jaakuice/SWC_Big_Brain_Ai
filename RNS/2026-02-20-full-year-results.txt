The Smarter Web Company PLC
(“The Smarter Web Company” or the "Company")
Full Year Results, Notice of AGM and New Investor Presentation


The Smarter Web Company (LSE: SWC | OTCQB: TSWCF | FRA: 3M8) is pleased to announce its
audited full year results for the period to 31st October 2025, publication of its Annual Report
and notice of Annual General Meeting, and a new investor presentation.
Full Year Results Summary
   £225.2 million raised, comprising £209.4m in equity capital and £15.8m in Bitcoin
Backed convertible notes
   2,660 Bitcoin held at year end; 2,689 Bitcoin held as of 19 February 2026
   Strong balance sheet with no fiat debt
The Group achieved a profit before tax of £2,835,848 for the year. Excluding one off gains and
fair value adjustment credit of £4,308,224, the result would have been a loss before tax of
£1,472,376.
Operating Business and Growth Strategy
The Group’s operating business has continued to perform in line with our expectations during
the year. Our underlying operations are stable, and we remain confident in the long-term
potential of the operating business.
In line with the Company’s 10-Year Plan, acquisitions are a core pillar of our strategy to continue
growing and strengthening the operating business. The Company is focused on selectively
acquiring profitable, cash-generative businesses with recurring revenue that enhance our core
capabilities and support a return to sustainable profitability.
During the year, several opportunities were reviewed, and the Board continues to see an
attractive pipeline of potential acquisitions that meet our criteria. The Company remains
disciplined in its capital allocation, targeting transactions with clear strategic fit and attractive
economics that support operating growth, enhance financial resilience across market cycles,
and reinforce the Company’s long-term objective of increasing Bitcoin per share.
Bitcoin Treasury Strategy
Alongside our operating business, the Group’s Bitcoin balance sheet continued to strengthen
during the year as we executed on our treasury strategy with a focus on long-term Bitcoin per
share growth. Insofar as the Board is aware, the Company remains the largest UK-listed public
holder of Bitcoin and continues to manage its balance sheet in a disciplined manner to support
sustainable value creation for shareholders.
At the year end, the Company held 2,660 Bitcoin, with a market value of approximately £220m.
This position provides the Group with a robust and differentiated balance sheet, which we
believe strengthens our long-term financial resilience.
While we acknowledge that Bitcoin is a volatile asset, the Board remains confident in its long-
term strategic role within the Group’s balance sheet framework. The Board believes Bitcoin
offers a uniquely scarce, secure and globally liquid store of value, supporting its position as a
core long-term asset. The Company remains committed to its Bitcoin strategy and will continue
to assess opportunities to grow its holdings over time, applying a disciplined approach to capital
raising and allocation.
Post Period Highlights: London Stock Exchange Listing

In February 2026, the Company successfully transferred its listing from Aquis to the Main
Market of the London Stock Exchange, reflecting the growth in scale achieved and the
Company’s long-term growth ambitions. The Board believes this represents an important
milestone, enhancing the Company’s profile, improving liquidity, and providing access to a
broader institutional investor base to support the next phase of growth.

Outlook
Looking ahead, the Company remains focused on executing its strategy, strengthening the
operating business, progressing its acquisition pipeline, and managing its Bitcoin treasury in a
disciplined manner. The Board enters Financial Year 2026 with confidence, supported by a
strengthened balance sheet, an expanding operating platform and a clear strategic roadmap
for long-term value creation.

Notice of AGM
The Company announces that it will shortly be posting the Notice of Annual General Meeting

Important Notice:
The Smarter Web Company Plc holds treasury reserves and surplus cash in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a
type of cryptocurrency or cryptoasset. Whilst the Board of Directors of the Company considers
holding Bitcoin to be in the best interests of the Company, the Board remains aware that the
financial regulator in the UK (the Financial Conduct Authority or FCA) considers investment in
Bitcoin to be high risk. An investment in the Company is not an investment in Bitcoin, either
directly or by proxy. However, the Board of Directors of the Company consider Bitcoin to be an
appropriate store of value and growth for the Company’s reserves and, accordingly, the
Company is materially exposed to Bitcoin. Such an approach is innovative, and the Board of
Directors of the Company wish to be clear and transparent with prospective and actual
investors in the Company on the Company’s position in this regard.
The Company is neither authorised nor regulated in the conduct of its business by the FCA. And
there is currently limited regulation of cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin) in the UK. As with most
other investments, the value of Bitcoin can go down as well as up, and therefore the value of
the Company’s Bitcoin holdings can fluctuate. The Company may not be able to realise its
Bitcoin exposure for the same as it paid in the first place or even for the value the Company
ascribes to its Bitcoin positions due to these market movements. An investment in the Company
is not protected by the UK’s Financial Ombudsman Service or the Financial Services
Compensation Scheme.
Nevertheless, the Board of Directors of the Company has taken the decision to invest in Bitcoin,
and in doing so is mindful of the special risks Bitcoin presents to the Company’s financial
position. These risks include (but are not limited to): (i) the value of Bitcoin can be highly
volatile, with value dropping as quickly as it can rise. Investors in Bitcoin must be prepared to
lose all money invested in Bitcoin; (ii) the Bitcoin market is largely unregulated. There is a risk
of losing money due to risks such as cyber-attacks, financial crime and counterparty failure; (iii)
the Company may not be able to buy or sell its Bitcoin at will. The ability to buy or sell Bitcoin
depends on various factors, including the supply and demand in the market at the relevant time.
Operational failings such as technology outages, cyber-attacks and comingling of funds could
cause unwanted delay; and (iv) cryptoassets are characterised in some quarters by high degrees
of fraud, money laundering and financial crime. In addition, there is a perception in some
quarters that cyber-attacks are prominent which can lead to theft of holdings or ransom
demands. The Board of Directors of the Company does not subscribe to such a negative view,
especially in relation to Bitcoin. However, prospective investors in the Company are encouraged
to do your own research before investing.
Key Statements and Financial Results
A remarkable amount has been achieved over the past year and we are excited about the
opportunities we see ahead for the business as we focus on building an efficient operating
model that is built to scale and support the Company’s strategic 10-year plan to deliver
shareholder value.

Our Bitcoin Treasury strategy is enabling us to build a strong balance sheet founded upon
Bitcoin with minimal gearing and without exposure to fiat debt. This creates a sustainable and
robust foundation allowing the Company to capitalise on opportunities as they present
themselves. Our commitment to retaining sufficient working capital to fund operating costs
provides us stability to weather the volatility in the financial markets.
Our focus is on establishing an efficient operating model that can scale and support the business
as it delivers on its strategy and growth ambitions. We have achieved this through being laser
focused on costs and applying stringent return on investment criteria in our capital allocation
decision making. During the year, the business transitioned from a private founder-run
business to a Main Market listed entity, with the associated costs of the listing process as well
as investment in building out enduring governance frameworks with the addition of key hires
including expansion of our Board.

Costs associated with the listing process are one-off due to the nature of the project and
totalled £1.35 million of which £660k was recognised in 2025 and the balance will be reflected
in the following financial year.

1. General Information
The Smarter Web Company Plc (the “Company”), formerly Uranium Energy Exploration Plc, is a public limited
company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The Company’s registered address is 160 Aztec
West, Almondsbury, Bristol, United Kingdom, BS32 4TU.

On 25 April 2025, the Company acquired the entire issued share capital of The Smarter Web Company
Operations Limited (“SWC Ltd”) and listed on the Aquis Stock Exchange. Details of the acquisition are included
in note 28. After the year end, the Company’s shares were admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange.

2. Material Accounting Policies
(a) Basis of preparation of financial statements
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International
Accounting Standards (“IAS”) and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. The consolidated financial
statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for revaluation of assets and
liabilities recognised at fair value.

The consolidated financial statements include the results of the Company and its subsidiaries (together the
“Group) and are presented in Pound Sterling, which is the presentational currency.

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IAS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires Directors to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s
accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where
assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 3.

Going concern

As at 31 October 2025 the Group had a cash balance of £1,503,118 (31 October 2024: £109,252), and net
assets of £210,379,352 (31 October 2024: net liabilities £921,384).

The Directors have considered the applicability of the going concern basis in the preparation of these
consolidated financial statements. This included the review of internal budgets and financial results which
show, taking into account reasonably probable changes in financial performance that the Group should be
able to operate within the level of its current funding arrangements.

The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will have ample resources to continue in operation
for the foreseeable future, underpinned by the successful completion of several fundraises during the year,
which have further strengthened the Group’s liquidity position. For this reason, the Directors have adopted
the going concern basis in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements.


(b) New and amended standards and interpretations
The following amendments to IAS became effective for the annual reporting period beginning on 1 November
2024 and did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements:

   Amendments to IAS 1 – ‘Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current’;
   Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 – ‘Supplier Finance Arrangements’;
   Amendments to IAS 1 – ‘Non-current Liabilities with Covenants’; and
   Amendments to IFRS 16 – ‘Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback’.


At the date of approval of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have
not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective:

Effective for accounting
periods beginning on or
Standard                                                                                               after
Amendments to IAS 21 – ‘Lack of Exchangeability’                                             1 January 2025
Amendments to IFRS 7 and IFRS 9 – ‘Classification and Measurement of                         1 January 2026
Financial Instruments and Contracts referencing nature-dependant
electricity’
Annual improvements to IFRS accounting standards (volume 11)                                  1 January 2026
IFRS 18 – ‘Presentation and Disclosures in Financial Statements’                              1 January 2027
IFRS 19 – Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures                             1 January 2025
(Not yet endorsed in the
UK)


The Directors do not expect that the adoption of these standards will have a material impact on the
consolidated financial statements in future periods.

(c) Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company is exposed to, or has
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns
through its power over the entity.

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the acquisition
method. In the consolidated statement of financial position, the acquiree’s identifiable assets and liabilities
are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date. The results of acquired operations are
included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date on which control is obtained.
They are deconsolidated from the date on which control ceases.

Intragroup balances, and any gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions,
are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.


(d) Cryptocurrency

The Group’s holding in Bitcoin is accounted for as an intangible asset with an indefinite useful economic life.
Bitcoin is traded in an active market and the Directors have adopted the revaluation measurement model.

Bitcoin purchases are initially recognised at cost and are subsequently re-valued to fair value based on the
market price provided by the Group’s cryptocurrency brokers. Increases in the carrying amounts arising on
revaluation are recognised, net of tax, in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the revaluation
reserve in equity. To the extent that the increase reverses a decrease previously recognised in profit or loss,
the increase is first recognised in profit or loss. Decreases that reverse previous increases of the same asset
are first recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent of the remaining surplus attributable to the
asset. All other decreases are charged to profit or loss.

On disposal, any associated revaluation surplus is transferred directly to retained earnings and is not recycled
through profit or loss.

Cryptocurrency is held for long term appreciation in line with the Group’s treasury policy and therefore is
classified as a non-current asset in the consolidated statement of financial position.

(e) Other intangible assets

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the Group’s interest in the fair value
of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Goodwill is not amortised and is stated at
cost less any accumulated impairment losses.

The recoverable amount of goodwill is tested for impairment annually or when events or changes in
circumstance indicate that it might be impaired. Impairment charges are deducted from the carrying value
and recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. For the purpose of
impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit
from synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the
carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any
goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata based on the carrying amount
of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.

Acquisition related intangible assets

Net assets acquired as part of a business combination includes an assessment of the fair value of separately
identifiable acquisition-related intangible assets, in addition to other assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities
purchased. These are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives which are individually assessed.

The intangible assets acquired by the Group in a business combination, and their useful economic lives and
the methods used to determine the cost of each intangible are as follows:


Amortisation period of intangible assets

Intangible asset                                            Amortisation period
Brand                                                       15 years
Customer relationships                                      15 years
Software                                                    15 years


(f) Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recognised so as to write
off the cost of assets less their residual values over their useful lives on the following basis:

Furniture and fittings                                                                      10% straight-line basis

(g) Right-of-use asset

The Group recognises right-of-use assets under lease agreements in which it is the lessee. The underlying asset
comprises a motor vehicle and is used in the normal course of business. The right-of-use asset is initially
measured at the present value of lease payments made at or before the commencement date as well as any
initial direct costs and an estimate of costs to be incurred in dismantling the asset. Lease incentives are
deducted from the cost of the right-of-use asset.

The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the lease-term and if necessary impaired in accordance with
applicable standards.
(h) Lease liabilities

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that
date, discounted using the rate implicit in the lease. The lease liability is subsequently measure by increasing
the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability (application of the effective interest method) and
by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made. No lease modification or reassessment
changes have been made during the reporting period from changes in any lease terms or rent charges.
(i) Equity
Share capital

Share capital represents the nominal value of ordinary equity shares.

Share premium

Share premium represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for equity
shares. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new equity shares are deducted from the share
premium account.

Merger relief reserve

Merger relief reserve represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for
equity shares issued by the Company as part of an acquisition of subsidiary, where merger relief under section
612 of the Companies Act 2006 applies.


Warrant reserve

Warrant reserve represents the fair value of outstanding warrants as at the date of issue by the Company.

Accumulated losses

Retained earnings and accumulated losses consist of cumulative net gains and losses recognised in the
consolidated statement of comprehensive income plus transactions recognised directly in equity.

(j) Financial assets

Classification

The Group classifies its financial assets into two categories, being financial assets held at amortised cost and
financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss.

Amortised cost

Financial assets held at amortised cost comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents.

These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
an active market. They arise principally through the provision of goods and services to customers (e.g., trade
receivables) but also incorporate other types of financial assets where the objective is to hold their assets in
order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual cash flows are solely payments of the principal and
interest. They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their
acquisition or issue and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method,
less provision for impairment.

Impairment provisions for trade and other receivables are recognised based on the simplified approach within
IFRS 9 using the lifetime expected credit losses (“ECL”) method. During this process the probability of the non-
payment of the receivables is assessed. This probability is then multiplied by the amount of the expected loss
arising from default to determine the lifetime ECL for the receivables. For trade and other receivables, which
are reported net, such provisions are recorded in a separate provision account with the loss being recognised
within administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. On confirmation that
the trade or other receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against
the associated provision.

Fair value through profit or loss

Financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss comprise equity investments. These are carried in the
statement of financial position at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, changes in fair value are
recognised in profit or loss.

(k) Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise of balances held in current bank accounts and payment processors that
are readily available for use in the Group’s operations.


(l) Financial liabilities

The Group’s financial liabilities are classified as either carried at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”) or
at amortised cost. Financial liabilities are classified as current liabilities unless, at the end of the reporting
period the Group has a right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting
period.

Financial liabilities carried at FVTPL and Day 1 losses

The Group’s financial liabilities carried at FVTPL consist of Smarter Convert CLN, detailed in note 24(d), which
has been designated by the Directors as carried at FVTPL. The Directors can designate a financial liability as
carried at FVTPL when it forms part of a contract containing one or more non-closely related embedded
derivatives, and IFRS 9 Financial Instrument (“IFRS 9”) permits the entire combined contract to be designated
as such.

Financial liabilities carried at FVTPL are initially recognised at fair value with the associated transaction costs
recognised in profit or loss. If the fair value at initial recognition is determined using a Level 3 valuation
technique and is higher than the transaction price (being the gross proceeds received), then the resulting
difference represents a loss (“Day 1 loss”) and is released into the profit or loss over the term of the instrument
on a straight-line basis within other gains and losses.

Changes in the fair value of the financial liabilities that are designated as carried at FVTPL are recognised in
profit or loss within other gains and losses, except for the amount of change in the fair value of the financial
liability that is attributable to changes in the credit risk of that liability which is recognised in other
comprehensive income.

Financial liabilities carried at FVTPL are presented net of Day 1 losses on the face of the consolidated statement
of financial position.

Financial liabilities carried at amortised cost

The Group’s financial liabilities carried at amortised cost comprise of trade and other payables and borrowings
not designated as carried at FVTPL and are recognised initially at fair value based on amounts exchanged, net
of transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

(m) Equity instruments

An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting
all its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct
issue costs.

(n) Compound instruments

The component parts of convertible loan notes issued by the Group are classified separately as financial
liabilities and equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of
a financial liability and an equity instrument. A conversion option that will be settled by the exchange of a fixed
amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of equity instruments issued by the Group is an
equity instrument.


(o) Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts
receivable for services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts and VAT.

The Group’s revenue arises from the provision of website development services. Revenue is recognised by
reference to the stage of completion of the contract. The stage of completion of a contract is measured by
comparing the costs incurred for work performed to date to the total estimated contract costs. Revenue is
only recognised to the extent of recoverable expenses when the outcome of a contract cannot be estimated
reliably.

(p) Employee benefits: pension obligations

The Group operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan is a pension
plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the contributions have been
paid the Group has no further payment obligations. The contributions are recognised as an expense in profit
or loss when they fall due. If contribution payments exceed the contribution due for service, the excess is
recognised as a prepayment.

(q) Other income and gains

Other income and gains comprise of net gains and losses on instruments held at fair value through profit or
loss and loans written off during the year.

(r) Finance costs

Finance costs comprise of interest payable on leases and other financial liabilities which are expensed in the
period in which they are incurred.

(s) Taxation

Corporation tax for the period presented comprises current and deferred tax. Current and deferred tax are
recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive
income, in which case they are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Current tax

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as
reported in profit or loss because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in
other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current
tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting
period.
Deferred tax

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities in consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the
computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent
that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be


utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial
recognition (other than in a business combination or for transactions that give rise to equal taxable and
deductible temporary differences) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable
profit nor the accounting profit. In addition, a deferred tax liability is not recognised if the temporary difference
arises from the initial recognition of goodwill.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that
it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be
recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability
is settled, or the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted
at the reporting date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets
against current tax liabilities, when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the
Directors intend to settle the Group’s current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

(t) Share-based payments

Equity-settled share-based payment transactions with parties other than employees are measured at the fair
value of the goods or services received, except where that fair value cannot be estimated reliably, in which
case they are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments granted, measured at the date the entity
obtains the goods, or the counterparty renders the service. The share-based payment expense is either
recognised in profit or loss or recognised as deduction in share premium. A corresponding increase in the
warrant reserve is also recognised.

(u) Operating segments

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief
operating decision-maker (“CODM”). The CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing
performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Board of Directors that makes strategic
decisions. The Group consists of one operating segment, being the provision of website development services
and therefore no segmental reporting is presented.


3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the Directors are required to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions which affect reported income, expenses, assets, liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on
historical experience, expectations of future events and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under
the circumstances. Actual results in the future could differ from such estimates. The estimates and underlying
assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period
in which the revision is made.

(a) Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
Accounting for warrants attached to convertible loan notes

Warrants that were issued in conjunction with the conversion of convertible loan notes (see note 21) have
been accounted for from the date of conversion when the terms of instruments were determined, as opposed
to the date of inception of the loans. On conversion and issue of the warrants, the warrants met the definition
of equity instruments under IAS 32, and accordingly, were recognised in the warrant reserve at fair value with
a corresponding reduction in share premium.

(b) Key sources of estimated uncertainty
Identifiable assets and liabilities assumed on acquisition of subsidiary

The fair value of intangible assets acquired through business combinations involves the use of valuation
techniques and the estimation of future cash flows to be generated over several years. Further details of the
business combination are included in note 28.

Valuation of Smarter Convert CLN

Smarter Convert CLN is a financial liability carried at FVTPL. Its valuation requires the use of the Monte Carlo
method to estimate the Company’s future share price as well as the Directors’ estimate of future price of
Bitcoin. Details of instrument and the valuation technique used are included in notes 24(d) and 26(b)
respectively.

associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares; and
-   the weighted average number of additional ordinary shares that would have been outstanding,
assuming the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.

*On acquisition of subsidiary, a merger relief reserve of £618,689 was recognised on the shares issued.

On 25 April 2025, following successful admission to Aquis the Company issued 139,851,357 Ordinary 0.1p
shares for net proceeds of £2,640,827. This consisted of 25,778,732 issued to sellers of SWC Ltd in
consideration (see note 28), 67,837,603 were issued to pre-IPO investors on settlement of the convertible

issued as part of the subscription and the remaining 6,224,000 were the number of placing shares issued.

On 9 July 2025, the Company issued 14,000,000 shares pursuant to a fundraising agreement with its broker
(“ATM Facility”) whereby the broker subscribes to the shares at nominal value and subsequently places the
shares with investors. Any premium over nominal value achieved through the placing by the broker is passed
to the Company less commission. All shares were placed as at year end.

On 4 September 2025, the Company issued 21,000,000 at par value pursuant to a subscription agreement
with its broker. Under the agreement, the broker may sell ordinary shares on behalf of the Company subject
to agreed restrictions, including weekly volume limits linked to market trading closing price, and the
Company will benefit by receiving approximately 97% of the net proceeds of any sales of the shares achieved
by the broker. As at 31 October 2025, a balance of 17,722,000 shares had not yet been placed. At 31 October
2025, £271,938 of the proceeds relating to the shares issued under the subscription agreement had not yet
been received by the Company and has been recognised within other receivables. The proceeds were
received subsequent to the year-end.

Deferred shares

The Company has 7,050,000 Deferred shares of 4.9p each in issue (2024: 7,050,000 Deferred shares). Deferred
shares are not transferable, do not carry any rights to attend meetings of the Company, to receive dividends
or distributions, except for return of capital on a winding up once the holders of ordinary shares have first


received a return on capital of £1,000,000 in respect of each Ordinary share held by them. The Company may
acquire from the holder of Deferred shares all of their Deferred shares for a total consideration of 1 pence.

On 25 April 2025, the Company issued 96,066,335 warrants, exercisable at 2.5 pence per ordinary shares
between 25 April 2026 and 25 April 2028. These warrants have been recognised at fair value, which has been
determined using the Black Scholes model with the following inputs:

As part of the Aquis IPO, the Company issued further 2,450,000 warrants to advisors on the same terms as the
warrants detailed above. This represents an equity settled share-based payment, which was recognised at the
fair value of the warrants issued.

On 9 October 2025, the Company issued warrants in connection with an equity placing of 9,680,640 ordinary
shares. The warrants entitle the holder to subscribe for one ordinary share at a fixed exercise price of £1.50
and are exercisable over a contractual term of 36 months. As the placing price for the shares and warrants of
£1.00 was below the quoted market price of the Company’s shares of £1.02 at the grant date, no fair value is
attributed to these warrants.

No warrants were issued during the year ended 31 October 2024.

The warrants are not subsequently revalued.

17) and a lease liability.

The Group has recognised one motor vehicle lease in the twelve months ended 31 October 2025 as a result of
acquisition of subsidiary (note 28). The hire purchase agreement includes the option to purchase the motor
vehicle at the end of lease term in November 2028, which is expected to be exercised, and the rate implicit in
the lease is 0%. No finance charges have been recognised in profit or loss in the relation to the lease.

(a) February 2025 Convertible loan note

In February 2025, the Company issued convertible loan notes (“Feb CLN”) to various pre-IPO investors,
totalling £1,356,752 who had originally subscribed for shares in the Company in connection with a previous
aborted IPO. The loan notes entitled the holders to receive shares on IPO at a 20% discount to the IPO price,
along with one warrant for each share received.


The loan notes had the option to be redeemed in cash in the event of a default. The loan notes mandatorily
converted to shares on IPO date, being 25 April 2025. The effective interest on the financial liability element
of the loan note is recorded as a finance cost of £339,188. On IPO, the terms of the warrants were finalised
and entitled the shareholders to subscribe for additional shares at fixed price, the IPO price, leading to the
warrants being recognised as equity instruments at fair value. The value of the warrants issued totals £833,306
and is recognised in equity in the Warrant Reserve, with the corresponding reduction in share premium as part
of IPO share issue costs.

(b) Loan from Power Metal Resources Plc

The loan from Power Metal Resources Plc (“POW”) was written off during the year ended 31 October 2025
with the corresponding gain recognised in other income in profit or loss. The loan from POW was provided in
connection with an acquisition opportunity related to an asset owned by POW, however the transaction
ultimately did not complete, and the loan was written off. At the time of the write-off, Sean Wade was the
chief executive officer of both POW and the Company however he did not have a controlling interest in either
company.

(c) Convertible loan facility and other borrowings

The Convertible loan facility was also repaid during the period. Other borrowings consisted of pre-IPO
investors who were either repaid or refinanced into Feb CLN detailed above.

(d) Smarter Convert CLN

On 5 August 2025, the Company issued a convertible loan note (“Smarter Convert CLN”) raising gross proceeds
of £15,803,733, which were used to acquire 177.8909127 Bitcoins and are held in a segregated wallet. The
instrument is interest-free and has a term of one year. On maturity, the instrument can be settled as follows,
at the option of the noteholders (“Settlement”):

(i)     Full or partial conversion of the notes into Company shares at £2.0475 per share; or
(ii)    Transfer of the Bitcoin acquired less transaction costs; or
(iii)   Payment of the equivalent of the value of Bitcoin in GBP, USD, or EUR;


The noteholders have the option to trigger Settlement at any time. The Company has the option to trigger
Settlement after 5 February 2026, if both the market price of the Company shares exceeds £3.07125 per share
for 10 consecutive trading days, and the percentage increase in the Company’s share price over that period
exceeds the percentage increase in the price of Bitcoin.

The instrument was analysed in accordance with the requirements of IAS 32 and IFRS 9 and the Directors have
elected on initial recognition to designate the whole instrument as a financial liability measured at fair value
through profit or loss as the instrument contains a non-closely-related embedded derivative.

The fair value of Smarter Convert CLN at initial recognition was calculated using Level 3 valuation techniques
detailed in note 26(b). As the fair value at of the liability at initial recognition exceeds the cash proceeds, the
resulting loss, Day 1 loss, is released into the profit or loss over the term of instrument. The initial recognition
of Smarter Convert CLN is detailed below:

As at 31 October 2025, the fair value of Smarter Convert CLN reduced to £15,722,418 with corresponding gain
of £6,434,435 recognised in other gains and losses. Day 1 losses of £1,588,280 were released into profit or loss
as an expense within other gains and losses.

has unused tax losses of £1,970,512 (2024: £1,145,530) available for offset against future profits. No deferred
tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses (2024: £nil) as it is not considered probable that there
will be future taxable profits available. All tax losses arose in the UK and may be carried forward indefinitely.

Financial instruments exclude prepayments, VAT, taxation and social security liability balances.

There are no material differences between the carrying value and fair value of the Group’s financial
instruments carried at amortised cost because of their short maturities.

All financial instruments are denominated in GBP.

(b) Fair value hierarchy
Some of the Group’s financial assets are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Valuation
techniques in determining the fair values are divided into three levels based on the quality of inputs. There
were no transfers between fair value hierarchies in the period ended 31 October 2025. (2024: None)

Level 1 – Quoted market prices

Fair value is determined by reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active
markets where the quoted price is readily available.

The following financial assets are recognised at fair value through profit or loss and are classified within the
Level 1 category:

31 October 2025       31 October 2024

£                       £
Listed securities                                                                1,649                       -


Level 2 – Valuation techniques using observable inputs

Fair value is determined using inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are unobservable,
directly or indirectly. There were no level 2 inputs during the year.

Level 3 – Valuation techniques using significant unobservable inputs

Fair value is dependent on significant inputs that are unobservable. The following financial liabilities are
recognised at fair value through profit or loss and are classified within the Level 3 category:


31 October 2025       31 October 2024

Valuation technique and inputs


The fair value of the Smarter Convert CLN at initial recognition and 31 October 2025 was estimated using a
Monte Carlo simulation model. The key inputs into the valuations were as follows:


5 August 2025        31 October 2025
Company share price                                                               £2.00                 £0.535
Risk-free rate                                                                    3.72%                  3.65%
Annualised volatility of Company shares                                           118%                   133%
Bitcoin price at 5 August 2026                                              US$ 122,055            US$ 116,210


Bitcoin prices at 5 August 2026 were derived from forward prices. The volatility of Company shares was derived
from a peer group of comparable listed companies as the Company shares have not been listed for a
sufficiently long period.

No change the fair value of the Smarter Convert CLN is attributable to the changes in Company’s credit risk.

Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy

There were no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the year.

(c) Risk management
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk
management framework. The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the
risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to
limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions
and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training, management standards and procedures, aims to
develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and
obligations.

The main financial risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are market risk, credit risk and liquidity
risk.

Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its
contractual obligations. The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. For
the Group, credit risk arises primarily from cash balances held at banks and other receivables. The risk in
relation to cash balances is mitigated by keeping cash with reputable financial institutions with a high credit
rating and keeping cash balances with payment processors for only as long as necessary.


Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that the Company and its subsidiaries might encounter difficulty in
settling its debts or otherwise meeting its obligations related to financial liabilities. The Directors manage this
risk by monitoring its financial resources and carefully planning its expenditure programmes. The Group has
successfully raised finance, and the Directors consider the Group’s investment in cryptocurrencies to be highly
liquid.

Contractual maturity dates of the Group’s financial liabilities are detailed below. The amounts are
undiscounted contractual payments and thus include future interest and charges.

The contractual amount payable on the Smarter Convert CLN, as detailed in note 24(d), is based on the price
of Bitcoin at the date of settlement and is subject to the noteholder electing to redeem the note in cash, unless
converted earlier by the Company. The figure used in the table above is based on the Directors’ estimated
price of Bitcoin when the instrument matures on 25 August 2026.

The Group has sufficient cash reserves to meet its lease and trade and other payables liabilities.

Market risk

The Group is not materially exposed to currency and interest rate risk. The Group’s market risk exposure is
limited to price fluctuations in the value of Bitcoin, which the Directors monitor closely and do not generally
rely on to fund working capital requirements. The Group’s remaining investment in listed securities is minimal
and is not considered material.

(d) Capital risk management
The Board’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern, to enable the Group to continue its principal activities, and to maintain an optimal capital structure
to reduce the cost of capital. The Group’s capital consists primarily of equity.

C1 Basis of preparation of the Company financial statements


The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 100 ‘Financial Reporting Standard
100’ issued by the Financial Reporting Council. Accordingly, the financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ and in accordance with the
Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies using FRS 101.

The Company previously prepared its financial statements in accordance with IAS. Due to the
similarities between FRS 101 and IAS, there are no adjustments on transition to FRS 101.

The Company financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis and under the
historical cost convention, except for revaluation of assets and liabilities recognised at fair value.

The Company financial statements are presented in Pound Sterling, which is its functional and
presentational currency.

Preparation of financial statements under FRS 101 requires the application of the recognition,
measurement and disclosure requirements of IAS but allows for the following disclosure exemptions:

•   FRS 101.8 (d): the requirements of IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' to make
disclosures about financial instruments;
•   FRS 101.8 (e): the requirements of IFRS 13 'Fair Value Measurement' (disclosure of valuation
techniques and inputs used for fair value measurement of assets and liabilities);
•   FRS 101.8 (g): the requirements of paragraphs 10(d), 10(f), 16, 38A, 38B, 38C, 38D, 111, and
134 to 136 of IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ to produce a cash flow statement
and to make an explicit and unreserved statement of compliance with IFRSs, additional
comparative information and capital management information;
•   FRS 101.8 (h): the requirements of IAS 7 'Statements of Cash Flows' to produce a cash flow
statement and related notes;
•   FRS 101.8 (i): the requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 'Accounting Policies,
Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors' to include a list of new IFRSs that have been
issued but that have yet to be applied;
•   FRS 101.8 (j): the requirements of paragraph 17 of IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosures’ (key
management compensation);
•   FRS 101.8 (k): the requirements of IAS 24 'Related Party Disclosures' to disclose related party
transactions entered between two or more members of a group, provided that any
subsidiary which is party to a transaction is wholly owned by such a member.
•   FRS 101.7A: the requirements of paragraphs 6-21 of IFRS 1 ‘ First Time Adoption of
International Financial Reporting Standards to present an opening statement of financial
position at the date of transition.


The preparation of financial statements in conformity with FRS 101 requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of
applying the Company’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or
complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are
disclosed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.
