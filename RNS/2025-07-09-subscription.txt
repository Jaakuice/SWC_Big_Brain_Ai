The Smarter Web Company PLC
(“The Smarter Web Company” or "Company")

Subscription and
Directors’ Holdings

The Smarter Web Company (AQUIS: SWC | OTCQB: TSWCF) is pleased to announce a
Subscription at the closing bid price on 08 July 2025.

The Subscription has raised £10,341,542.25 (before expenses), through the issue of 3,182,013
new ordinary shares of £0.001 each ("Ordinary Shares") at £3.25 per share.

It is expected that Admission of the new Ordinary Shares will become effective at 08:00, on
or around 14 July 2025. The Subscription is conditional upon, among other things, Admission
becoming effective.

The Subscription Ordinary Shares, when issued, will be fully paid and will rank pari passu in
all respects with each other and with the existing Ordinary Shares of the Company, including,
without limitation, the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made
or paid after the date of issue.

Total Voting Rights
Following Admission, the total number of Ordinary Shares in issue in The Smarter Web
Company will be 259,649,448 ordinary shares of £0.001 each. This figure may be used by
shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are
required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company under the
FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.

Directors Share Holdings

Following recent fundraising activities (summarised below), the Company announces updated
percentages relating to the Directors’ share holdings.

• A Subscription Agreement, updated 07 July, where 14 million shares have now been
admitted to the Access Segment of the Aquis Stock Exchange Growth Market and
proceeds will be announced once all shares have been successfully placed. Shares
cannot be placed below the previous days closing bid price. Other terms are as per the
19 June announcement

This has resulted in a dilution of 5.46% for existing shareholders, including the Directors,
offset by the proceeds of the 14 million shares when proceeds will be known.
