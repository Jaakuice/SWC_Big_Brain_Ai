The Smarter Web Company PLC
(“The Smarter Web Company” or the "Company")

Updated Corporate Website

The Smarter Web Company PLC (AQUIS: SWC | OTCQB: TSWCF | FRA: 3M8), a London-listed
technology company and the UK’s largest publicly traded company holding Bitcoin on its
balance sheet, is pleased to announce the launch of its refreshed corporate website.

Alongside enhanced investor relations content, the site showcases the Company’s core
operating business: delivering high-quality website solutions to clients across the UK and
internationally. As part of this website launch, we are also relaunching The Smarter Web
Company brand – signalling our ambition to lead the UK market as a business that has
successfully leveraged digital capital to accelerate growth in our core operating activities
while simultaneously building long-term value through a Bitcoin treasury.

This refreshed identity is designed to position The Smarter Web Company at the forefront of
a new generation of quoted companies that appeals to both retail and institutional investors:
a company that seeks to scale sustainably, responsibly manage a treasury in Bitcoin, and
combine commercial execution with Bitcoin stewardship. The Board believes this approach
places the Company in a strong position within the UK public markets as we continue to grow
our operating business, increase our Bitcoin holdings and aim to create long-term value for
our shareholders.

Andrew Webley, CEO of The Smarter Web Company, commented:
“Our upgraded website reflects the business we have started to become - more focused, more
scaled, and more confident in communicating both our operational strength and our Bitcoin
treasury strategy. Alongside more comprehensive investor relations content, we showcase the
fantastic websites we design for our clients, with a portfolio of live examples. Our goal is to
ensure clients and investors can access what they need in just a few clicks, with a clear
understanding of who we are and what we deliver.”
