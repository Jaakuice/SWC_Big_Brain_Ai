Subscription Tranche Update - £19.7m Proceeds

The Smarter Web Company (AQUIS: SWC | OTCQB: TSWCF | FRA: 3M8), a London listed
technology company, announces that 6,057,914 new Ordinary Shares have been placed from
the current tranche of 14,000,000 new Ordinary Shares.

The proceeds of the 6,057,914 new Ordinary Shares are £19,680,874 (before expenses),
equivalent to approximately £3.25 per share, and the Company will receive approximately
97% of the proceeds as settlement early this week. The shares were placed in line with the
Subscription Agreement, over a 3 week period, between 07 July and 25 July with no shares
being placed on some days.

The Company has decided that an update every 2 weeks, from this announcement, would be
helpful for shareholders, and enable the Company to receive funds earlier and therefore the
Company now intends to announce subscription proceeds accordingly.

It is also expected that once the current tranche is complete (in total 14,000,000 new Ordinary
Shares, with 7,942,086 not yet placed) that a new Subscription Agreement will be signed. All
terms of the proposed new Subscription Agreement are expected to remain the same as the
current Subscription Agreement as the Company believes that the current Subscription
Agreement has been beneficial to the Company.

Andrew Webley, CEO of The Smarter Web Company said “We wanted to update shareholders
with the current tranche, and this also enables the proceeds to be settled early this week. I
would like to thank both Shard Merchant Capital and Tennyson Securities for the work to date
on this innovative funding solution and look forward to reporting future proceeds.”
