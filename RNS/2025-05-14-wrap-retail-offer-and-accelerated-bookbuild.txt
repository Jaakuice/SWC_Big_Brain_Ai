The WRAP Retail Offer

The Company values retail shareholders and believes that it is appropriate to provide both
new and existing retail shareholders in the United Kingdom the opportunity to participate in
the WRAP Retail Offer.

Therefore, the Company is making the WRAP Retail Offer open to eligible investors in the
United Kingdom, being new or existing shareholders of The Smarter Web Company, following
release of this announcement and through certain financial intermediaries.

A number of retail platforms are able to access the WRAP Retail Offer. Non-holders or existing

or wealth manager who will confirm if they are participating in the WRAP Retail Offer.

The WRAP Retail Offer will open immediately following this announcement. The WRAP Retail
Offer will close at 21:00 on 14 May 2025. Eligible investors are encouraged to participate
early, as financial intermediaries may impose earlier deadlines, and the Company also
reserves the right to close the offer earlier. The result of the WRAP Retail Offer is expected to
be announced by the Company on 15 May 2025 shortly after 07:00.

Retail brokers wishing to participate in the WRAP Retail Offer on behalf of eligible retail
investors, should contact WRAP@winterflood.com.

To be eligible to participate in the WRAP Retail Offer, applicants must be a customer of a
participating intermediary including individuals aged 18 years or over, companies and other
bodies corporate, partnerships, trusts, associations and other unincorporated organisations.

There is a minimum subscription of £500 per investor under the WRAP Retail Offer. The terms

The WRAP Retail Offer Shares will, when issued, be credited as fully paid, and have the right
to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid after their date of

It is a term of the WRAP Retail Offer that the total value of the WRAP Retail Offer Shares
available for subscription at the Issue Price does not exceed EUR 8 million (or the equivalent
amount in GBP, calculated in accordance with the Prospectus Rules Regulations Sourcebook
of the Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”).

Investors should make their own investigations into the merits of an investment in the
Company. Nothing in this announcement amounts to a recommendation to invest in the
Company or amounts to investment, taxation or legal advice.

It should be noted that a subscription for Ordinary Shares and investment in the Company
carries a number of risks, including the risk that investors may lose their entire investment.
Investors should take independent advice from a person experienced in advising on
investment in securities such as the Ordinary Shares if they are in any doubt.

An investment in the Company will place capital at risk. The value of investments, and any
income, can go down as well as up, so investors could get back less than the amount
invested.

Neither past performance nor any forecasts should be considered a reliable indicator of
future results.

The WRAP Retail Offer is offered in the United Kingdom as an exempt offer to the public
under sections 86(1)(e) and 86(4) of FSMA and therefore there is no the requirement to
publish a prospectus under the United Kingdom version of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it
forms part of United Kingdom law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as
amended) in connection with the WRAP Retail Offer. The WRAP Retail Offer is not being made
into any jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom.
