The Smarter Web Company PLC Appoints Coinbase Institutional as a Custody Partner

The Smarter Web Company (AQUIS: SWC | OTCQB: TSWCF | FRA: 3M8), a London-listed
technology company and the UK’s largest publicly traded company holding Bitcoin on its
balance sheet, is pleased to announce the appointment of Coinbase Institutional as one of its
Bitcoin custody partners. This partnership marks a significant step in strengthening the
company’s treasury infrastructure and underlines its position as a market leader in the rapidly
evolving Bitcoin ecosystem.

Since listing on the Aquis Stock Exchange in April 2025, SWC has grown to become one of the
fastest-growing Bitcoin treasury companies in the world. Coinbase Institutional, a trusted
global platform with deep expertise in custody and execution, will further strengthen SWC’s
treasury infrastructure through Coinbase Prime, providing SWC with an additional layer of
resilience and security.

Coinbase Institutional will work alongside SWC’s existing custody partners to safeguard the
Company’s Bitcoin treasury and support efficient market access. This multi-custodian
approach reflects SWC’s commitment to the highest standards of governance, risk
management, and transparency for shareholders.

This development further reinforces SWC’s leadership in the UK market and highlights its
ambition to set global benchmarks in corporate Bitcoin treasury management. By combining
a growing balance sheet with world-class custodial partners, SWC is positioned to continue
its rapid growth trajectory and deliver long-term value for investors.

Commenting on the appointment, Andrew Webley, Chief Executive Officer of SWC, said:
“Coinbase has established itself as one of the most respected and regulated players in the
digital asset space. Their institutional-grade custody solutions and execution infrastructure
are an ideal fit for our strategy. We are delighted to welcome them as a partner to help us
scale securely and responsibly.”

billions of assets with robust security and technical expertise. As a leading S&P 500 company,
Coinbase Institutional is proud to add The Smarter Web Company to the list of leading
