(“The Smarter Web Company” or the "Company")

Subscription Agreement Update - £0.3m Gross Proceeds

The Smarter Web Company (AQUIS: SWC | OTCQB: TSWCF | FRA: 3M8), a London-listed
technology company and the UK’s largest publicly traded company holding Bitcoin on its
balance sheet, announces that 407,500 Ordinary Shares have been placed in accordance with
the terms of the Subscription Agreement announced on 04 September 2025 (the
“Subscription Shares”).

The gross proceeds from the placing of the Subscription Shares will be £276,781.80 (before
expenses), equivalent to approximately £0.68 per share, and the Company will receive
approximately 98% of the proceeds as settlement early this week. The balance of Ordinary
Shares not yet placed pursuant to the Subscription Agreement is 13,470,500.

Andrew Webley, CEO of The Smarter Web Company, commented: “We recognise the recent
decline in the Company’s mNAV, reflecting a broader compression across companies adopting
Bitcoin treasuries.

While sentiment towards holding Bitcoin on corporate balance sheets will fluctuate, we
remain focused on building long-term value and strengthening our position through
disciplined, strategic use of equity and other tools.”
