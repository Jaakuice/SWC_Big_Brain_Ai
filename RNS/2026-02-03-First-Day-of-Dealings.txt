have come since our start-up days, but also the strength, discipline and maturity of the
Company today. We remain committed to building a British success story that contributes
meaningfully to the UK economy, showcases the ambition of the UK's entrepreneurial spirit,
and demonstrates the role that Bitcoin, as a form of digital capital, can play in supporting the
growth of modern businesses."
