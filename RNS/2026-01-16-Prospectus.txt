The Smarter Web Company (AQUIS: SWC | OTCQB: TSWCF | FRA: 3M8) is pleased to
announce that a prospectus in relation to the proposed admission to trading of the Company’s
ordinary shares on the equity shares (commercial companies) category of the UK Financial
Conduct Authority’s (the “FCA”) Official List and to trading on the London Stock Exchange’s
Main Market for listed securities (“Proposed Admission”) (“Prospectus”) has been approved
by the FCA and published by the Company today.

A copy of the Prospectus will shortly be available on the Company’s website at
https://www.smarterwebcompany.co.uk/ and will be uploaded to the National Storage

The Proposed Admission marks an important step in strengthening the foundations on which
the Directors intend to scale the business and deliver the Company's long-term growth
ambitions. The move to the Main Market is expected to deliver numerous key benefits,

previously been unable to invest in the Company

“Taking a UK-born business from start-up to a public company is an achievement of which I
am extremely proud. Moving to the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange marks the
next significant milestone in that journey. I am committed to building a British success story
that contributes to the UK economy, showcases the strength of the UK’s entrepreneurial spirit
in the technology sector, and demonstrates how Bitcoin can be used as digital capital.”
