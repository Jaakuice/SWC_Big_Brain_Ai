The Smarter Web Company is pleased to announce the successful completion of a retail
investor offer via the Winterflood Retail Access Platform (“WRAP Retail Offer") and an

and Peterhouse Capital Limited.

The WRAP Retail Offer and Bookbuild has raised approximately £2.24 million (before
expenses) through the issue of a total of 14,015,320 new ordinary shares of £0.001 each
("Ordinary Shares") at 16 pence per share (“Offer Price”). The Offer Price was at the closing
bid price yesterday, 07 May 2025.

• A total of 8,418,445 new Ordinary Shares will be issued through the WRAP Retail Offer
at the Offer Price, raising £1,346,951 (before expenses)
• A total of 5,596,875 new Ordinary Shares will be issued through the Bookbuild at the
Offer Price, raising £895,500 (before expenses)

It is expected that Admission of the new Ordinary Shares will become effective at 08:00, on

becoming effective.

The WRAP Retail Offer and the Bookbuild Ordinary Shares, when issued, will be fully paid and
will rank pari passu in all respects with each other and with the existing Ordinary Shares of
the Company, including, without limitation, the right to receive all dividends and other
distributions declared, made or paid after the date of issue.
