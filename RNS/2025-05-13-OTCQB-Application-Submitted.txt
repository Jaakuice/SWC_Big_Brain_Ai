The Smarter Web Company PLC
(“The Smarter Web Company” or "Company")

OTCQB Application Submitted

Resultant Directors’ Holdings after Fundraising

The Smarter Web Company (AQUIS: SWC) is pleased to announce that it has submitted an
application to the OTC Markets Group for its ordinary shares to be cross-traded publicly on
the OTCQB Market in the United States.

Subject to approval, this listing would enable greater accessibility for North American
investors and marks a significant step in expanding the Company’s international presence.

This initiative aligns with the Company’s strategic goal of delivering shareholder value and
increasing its global profile.

The decision follows numerous enquiries and expressions of interest from U.S. based
investors seeking the ability to invest in the Company.

The cross-trading on the OTCQB is expected to open new avenues for shareholder growth and
broaden our investor base across a key global market.

It is expected that approval and admission to trading will take approximately 30 working days
from the date of this announcement. A further announcement will be made in due course.

Andrew Webley, CEO of The Smarter Web Company said: “While our core focus remains on
building a strong, UK-based business, we are seeing global interest in our Company.

Enabling access for North American investors through the OTCQB is a natural step in
broadening our reach.

We are committed to delivering long-term shareholder value and believe that improving
accessibility to our shares globally makes this a strategically sound and timely initiative.

We've already become the most liquid stock on the Aquis Exchange in our short time as a
public company, and this cross-trading arrangement is expected to enhance that liquidity even
further.”
