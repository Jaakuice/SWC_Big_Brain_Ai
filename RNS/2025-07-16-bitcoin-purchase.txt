SWC Research Brief - The P/E Ratio for Bitcoin Treasury Companies: P/BYD

The Smarter Web Company has today published a Research Brief to introduce a new metric
(P/BYD) for analysing the performance and valuation of Bitcoin Treasury Companies. The
P/BYD ratio aims to enable investors and analysts to understand better why a public company
would hold Bitcoin as a treasury asset, in a similar way to the P/E ratio commonly used when
evaluating traditional equities.

The Smarter Web Company believes that the P/BYD ratio may provide valuable insights for
both the Bitcoin and the broader investor community to better understand the value
proposition of Bitcoin Treasury Companies and today publishes this research brief.

The SWC Research Brief “The P/E Ratio for Bitcoin Treasury Companies: P/BYD” is available
