The Smarter Web Company PLC
(“The Smarter Web Company” or "Company")

WRAP Retail Offer & Accelerated Bookbuild for A Minimum of £8 Million

The Smarter Web Company PLC is pleased to announce a retail investor offer via the
Winterflood Retail Access Platform (“WRAP Retail Offer") and a placing of the Company’s
shares by Tennyson Securities and Peterhouse Capital Limited to institutional investors
(“Accelerated Bookbuild” or “Placing”) through the issue of new ordinary shares of £0.001
each at £0.81 per share ("Ordinary Shares") (“Offer Price”). The WRAP Retail Offer and
Accelerated Bookbuild will open immediately following this announcement and the Company
aims to raise a minimum of £8m.

Please note that the WRAP Retail Offer is being made in the United Kingdom as an exempt
public offer, which is subject to a €8 million fundraising limit over a 12 month period. As a
result of previous successful fundraises, the Company is only able to raise a maximum of
approximately £400,000 through this WRAP Retail Offer. Consequently, applications may be
scaled back, and the offer may close earlier than anticipated.

Qualified Investors (as defined in Article 2(e) of the United Kingdom version of Regulation
(EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of United Kingdom law by virtue of the European Union
(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended from time to time) (“UK Prospectus Regulation”))
interested in participating in the Accelerated Bookbuild, rather than the WRAP Retail Offer,

1005744704.1
may receive a higher allocation by instructing their broker to contact Tennyson Securities or
Peterhouse Capital Limited and asking to take part in the Accelerated Bookbuild.

The Company is working with its advisors to explore alternative solutions that would enable
retail investors to participate in future fundraisings. The Company also wishes to emphasise
that previous capital raises have been conducted at market price and have included
participation from retail investors.

The WRAP Retail Offer

The Company values retail shareholders and believes that it is appropriate to provide both
new and existing retail shareholders in the United Kingdom the opportunity to participate in
the WRAP Retail Offer.

For the avoidance of doubt, the WRAP Retail Offer is not part of the Placing. Completion of
the WRAP Retail Offer is conditional, inter alia, upon the completion of the Placing but
completion of the Placing is not conditional on the completion of the WRAP Retail Offer.

Therefore, the Company is making the WRAP Retail Offer open to eligible investors in the
United Kingdom, being new or existing shareholders of The Smarter Web Company, following
release of this announcement and through certain financial intermediaries.

A number of retail platforms are able to access the WRAP Retail Offer. Non-holders or existing
shareholders wishing to subscribe for WRAP Retail Offer Shares should contact their broker
or wealth manager who will confirm if they are participating in the WRAP Retail Offer.

1005744704.1
The WRAP Retail Offer will open immediately following this announcement. The WRAP Retail
Offer will close at 21:00 on 04 June 2025. Eligible investors are encouraged to participate
early, as financial intermediaries may impose earlier deadlines, and the Company also
reserves the right to close the offer earlier. The result of the WRAP Retail Offer is expected to
be announced by the Company on 05 June 2025 shortly after 07:00.

Retail brokers wishing to participate in the WRAP Retail Offer on behalf of eligible retail
investors, should contact WRAP@winterflood.com.

To be eligible to participate in the WRAP Retail Offer, applicants must be a customer of a
participating intermediary including individuals aged 18 years or over, companies and other
bodies corporate, partnerships, trusts, associations and other unincorporated organisations.

There is a minimum subscription of £500 per investor under the WRAP Retail Offer. The terms
and conditions on which investors subscribe will be provided by the relevant financial
intermediaries including relevant commission or fee charges.

The Company reserves the right to amend the size of the WRAP Retail Offer at its discretion.
The Company reserves the right to scale back any order and to reject any application for
subscription under the WRAP Retail Offer without giving any reason for such rejection.

It is vital to note that once an application for WRAP Retail Offer Shares has been made and
accepted via an intermediary, it cannot be withdrawn.

The WRAP Retail Offer Shares will, when issued, be credited as fully paid, and have the right
to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid after their date of
issue.

It is a term of the WRAP Retail Offer that the total value of the WRAP Retail Offer Shares
available for subscription at the Issue Price does not exceed EUR 8 million (or the equivalent
amount in GBP, calculated in accordance with the Prospectus Rules Regulations Sourcebook
of the Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”).

Investors should make their own investigations into the merits of an investment in the
Company. Nothing in this announcement amounts to a recommendation to invest in the
Company or amounts to investment, taxation or legal advice.

It should be noted that a subscription for Ordinary Shares and investment in the Company
carries a number of risks, including the risk that investors may lose their entire investment.
Investors should take independent advice from a person experienced in advising on
investment in securities such as the Ordinary Shares if they are in any doubt.

1005744704.1
An investment in the Company will place capital at risk. The value of investments, and any
income, can go down as well as up, so investors could get back less than the amount
invested.

Neither past performance nor any forecasts should be considered a reliable indicator of
future results.

The WRAP Retail Offer is offered in the United Kingdom as an exempt offer to the public
under sections 86(1)(e) and 86(4) of FSMA and therefore there is no the requirement to
publish a prospectus under the UK Prospectus Regulation in connection with the WRAP Retail
Offer. The WRAP Retail Offer is not being made into any jurisdiction other than the United
Kingdom.
